Rachel Pike : The science behind a climate headline
In 4 minutes , atmospheric chemist Rachel Pike provides a glimpse of the massive scientific effort behind the bold headlines on climate change , with her team -- one of thousands who contributed -- taking a risky flight over the rainforest in pursuit of data on a key molecule .
I &apos;d like to talk to you today about the scale of the scientific effort that goes into making the headlines you see in the paper .
Headlines that look like this when they have to do with climate change , and headlines that look like this when they have to do with air quality or smog .
They are both two branches of the same field of atmospheric science .
Recently the headlines looked like this when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , or IPCC , put out their report on the state of understanding of the atmospheric system .
That report was written by 620 scientists from 40 countries .
They wrote almost a thousand pages on the topic .
And all of those pages were reviewed by another 400-plus scientists and reviewers , from 113 countries .
It &apos;s a big community . It &apos;s such a big community , in fact , that our annual gathering is the largest scientific meeting in the world .
Over 15,000 scientists go to San Francisco every year for that .
And every one of those scientists is in a research group , and every research group studies a wide variety of topics .
For us at Cambridge , it &apos;s as varied as the El Ni√±o oscillation , which affects weather and climate , to the assimilation of satellite data , to emissions from crops that produce biofuels , which is what I happen to study .
And in each one of these research areas , of which there are even more , there are PhD students , like me , and we study incredibly narrow topics , things as narrow as a few processes or a few molecules .
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene , which is here . It &apos;s a small organic molecule . You &apos;ve probably never heard of it .
The weight of a paper clip is approximately equal to 900 zeta-illion -- 10 to the 21st -- molecules of isoprene .
But despite its very small weight , enough of it is emitted into the atmosphere every year to equal the weight of all the people on the planet .
It &apos;s a huge amount of stuff . It &apos;s equal to the weight of methane .
And because it &apos;s so much stuff , it &apos;s really important for the atmospheric system .
Because it &apos;s important to the atmospheric system , we go to all lengths to study this thing .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
This is the EUPHORE Smog Chamber in Spain .
Atmospheric explosions , or full combustion , takes about 15,000 times longer than what happens in your car .
But still , we look at the pieces .
We run enormous models on supercomputers ; this is what I happen to do .
Our models have hundreds of thousands of grid boxes calculating hundreds of variables each , on minute timescales .
And it takes weeks to perform our integrations .
And we perform dozens of integrations in order to understand what &apos;s happening .
We also fly all over the world looking for this thing .
I recently joined a field campaign in Malaysia . There are others .
We found a global atmospheric watchtower there , in the middle of the rainforest , and hung hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of scientific equipment off this tower , to look for isoprene , and of course , other things while we were there .
This is the tower in the middle of the rainforest , from above .
And this is the tower from below .
And on part of that field campaign we even brought an aircraft with us .
And this plane , the model , BA146 , which was run by FAAM , normally flies 120 to 130 people .
So maybe you took a similar aircraft to get here today .
But we didn &apos;t just fly it . We were flying at 100 meters above the top of the canopy to measure this molecule -- incredibly dangerous stuff .
We have to fly at a special incline in order to make the measurements .
We hire military and test pilots to do the maneuvering .
We have to get special flight clearance .
And as you come around the banks in these valleys , the forces can get up to two Gs .
And the scientists have to be completely harnessed in in order to make measurements while they &apos;re on board .
So , as you can imagine , the inside of this aircraft doesn &apos;t look like any plane you would take on vacation .
It &apos;s a flying laboratory that we took to make measurements in the region of this molecule .
We do all of this to understand the chemistry of one molecule .
And when one student like me has some sort of inclination or understanding about that molecule , they write one scientific paper on the subject .
And out of that field campaign we &apos;ll probably get a few dozen papers on a few dozen processes or molecules .
And as a body of knowledge builds up , it will form one subsection , or one sub-subsection of an assessment like the IPCC , although we have others .
And each one of the 11 chapters of the IPCC has six to ten subsections .
So you can imagine the scale of the effort .
In each one of those assessments that we write , we always tag on a summary , and the summary is written for a non-scientific audience .
And we hand that summary to journalists and policy makers , in order to make headlines like these .
Thank you very much .
Christopher deCharms : A look inside the brain in real time
Neuroscientist and inventor Christopher deCharms demonstrates a new way to use fMRI to show brain activity -- thoughts , emotions , pain -- while it is happening . In other words , you can actually see how you feel .
Hi . I &apos;m going to ask you to raise your arms and wave back , just the way I am -- kind of a royal wave .
You can mimic what you can see .
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
Soon , you &apos;ll be able to look inside your brain and program , control the hundreds of brain areas that you see there .
I &apos;m going to tell you about that technology .
People have wanted to look inside the human mind , the human brain , for thousands of years .
Well , coming out of the research labs just now , for our generation , is the possibility to do that .
People envision this as being very difficult .
You had to take a spaceship , shrink it down , inject it into the bloodstream .
It was terribly dangerous .
You could be attacked by white blood cells in the arteries .
But now , we have a real technology to do this .
We &apos;re going to fly into my colleague Peter &apos;s brain .
We &apos;re going to do it non-invasively using MRI .
We don &apos;t have to inject anything . We don &apos;t need radiation .
We will be able to fly into the anatomy of Peter &apos;s brain -- literally , fly into his body -- but more importantly , we can look into his mind .
When Peter moves his arm , that yellow spot you see there is the interface to the functioning of Peter &apos;s mind taking place .
Now you &apos;ve seen before that with electrodes you can control robotic arms , that brain imaging and scanners can show you the insides of brains .
What &apos;s new is that that process has typically taken days or months of analysis .
We &apos;ve collapsed that through technology to milliseconds , and that allows us to let Peter to look at his brain in real time as he &apos;s inside the scanner .
He can look at these 65,000 points of activation per second .
If he can see this pattern in his own brain , he can learn how to control it .
There have been three ways to try to impact the brain : the therapist &apos;s couch , pills and the knife .
This is a fourth alternative that you are soon going to have .
We all know that as we form thoughts , they form deep channels in our minds and in our brains .
Chronic pain is an example . If you burn yourself , you pull your hand away .
But if you &apos;re still in pain in six months &apos; or six years &apos; time , it &apos;s because these circuits are producing pain that &apos;s no longer helping you .
If we can look at the activation in the brain that &apos;s producing the pain , we can form 3D models and watch in real time the brain process information , and then we can select the areas that produce the pain .
So put your arms back up and flex your bicep .
Now imagine that you will soon be able to look inside your brain and select brain areas to do that same thing .
What you &apos;re seeing here is , we &apos;ve selected the pathways in the brain of a chronic pain patient .
This may shock you , but we &apos;re literally reading this person &apos;s brain in real time .
They &apos;re watching their own brain activation , and they &apos;re controlling the pathway that produces their pain .
They &apos;re learning to flex this system that releases their own endogenous opiates .
As they do it , in the upper left is a display that &apos;s yoked to their brain activation of their own pain being controlled .
When they control their brain , they can control their pain .
This is an investigational technology , but , in clinical trials , we &apos;re seeing a 44 to 64 percent decrease in chronic pain patients .
This is not &quot; The Matrix . &quot; You can only do this to yourself . You take control .
I &apos;ve seen inside my brain . You will too , soon .
When you do , what do you want to control ?
You will be able to look at all the aspects that make you yourself , all your experiences .
These are some of the areas we &apos;re working on today that I don &apos;t have time to go into in detail .
But I want to leave with you the big question .
We are the first generation that &apos;s going to be able to enter into , using this technology , the human mind and brain .
Where will we take it ?
Beeban Kidron : The shared wonder of film
Movies have the power to create a shared narrative experience and to shape memories and worldviews . British film director Beeban Kidron invokes iconic film scenes -- from &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; Miracle in Milan &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; to &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; Boyz n the Hood &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; -- as she shows how her group FILMCLUB shares great films with kids .
Evidence suggests that humans in all ages and from all cultures create their identity in some kind of narrative form .
From mother to daughter , preacher to congregant , teacher to pupil , storyteller to audience .
Whether in cave paintings or the latest uses of the Internet , human beings have always told their histories and truths through parable and fable .
We are inveterate storytellers .
But where , in our increasingly secular and fragmented world , do we offer communality of experience , unmediated by our own furious consumerism ?
And what narrative , what history , what identity , what moral code are we imparting to our young ?
Cinema is arguably the 20th century &apos;s most influential art form .
Its artists told stories across national boundaries , in as many languages , genres and philosophies as one can imagine .
Indeed , it is hard to find a subject that film has yet to tackle .
During the last decade we &apos;ve seen a vast integration of global media , now dominated by a culture of the Hollywood blockbuster .
We are increasingly offered a diet in which sensation , not story , is king .
What was common to us all 40 years ago -- the telling of stories between generations -- is now rarified .
As a filmmaker , it worried me .
As a human being , it puts the fear of God in me .
What future could the young build with so little grasp of where they &apos;ve come from and so few narratives of what &apos;s possible ?
The irony is palpable ; technical access has never been greater , cultural access never weaker .
And so in 2006 we set up FILMCLUB , an organization that ran weekly film screenings in schools followed by discussions .
If we could raid the annals of 100 years of film , maybe we could build a narrative that would deliver meaning to the fragmented and restless world of the young .
Given the access to technology , even a school in a tiny rural hamlet could project a DVD onto a white board .
In the first nine months we ran 25 clubs across the U.K. , with kids in age groups between five and 18 watching a film uninterrupted for 90 minutes .
The films were curated and contextualized .
But the choice was theirs , and our audience quickly grew to choose the richest and most varied diet that we could provide .
The outcome , immediate .
It was an education of the most profound and transformative kind .
In groups as large as 150 and as small as three , these young people discovered new places , new thoughts , new perspectives .
By the time the pilot had finished , we had the names of a thousand schools that wished to join .
The film that changed my life is a 1951 film by Vittorio De Sica , &quot; Miracle in Milan . &quot;
It &apos;s a remarkable comment on slums , poverty and aspiration .
I had seen the film on the occasion of my father &apos;s 50th birthday .
Technology then meant we had to hire a viewing cinema , find and pay for the print and the projectionist .
But for my father , the emotional and artistic importance of De Sica &apos;s vision was so great that he chose to celebrate his half-century with his three teenage children and 30 of their friends , &quot; In order , &quot; he said , &quot; to pass the baton of concern and hope on to the next generation . &quot;
In the last shot of &quot; Miracle in Milan , &quot; slum-dwellers float skyward on flying brooms .
Sixty years after the film was made and 30 years after I first saw it , I see young faces tilt up in awe , their incredulity matching mine .
And the speed with which they associate it with &quot; Slumdog Millionaire &quot; or the favelas in Rio speaks to the enduring nature .
In a FILMCLUB season about democracy and government , we screened &quot; Mr. Smith Goes to Washington . &quot;
Made in 1939 , the film is older than most of our members &apos; grandparents .
Frank Capra &apos;s classic values independence and propriety .
It shows how to do right , how to be heroically awkward .
It is also an expression of faith in the political machine as a force of honor .
Shortly after &quot; Mr. Smith &quot; became a FILMCLUB classic , there was a week of all-night filibustering in the House of Lords .
And it was with great delight that we found young people up and down the country explaining with authority what filibustering was and why the Lords might defy their bedtime on a point of principle .
After all , Jimmy Stewart filibustered for two entire reels .
In choosing &quot; Hotel Rwanda , &quot; they explored genocide of the most brutal kind .
It provoked tears as well as incisive questions about unarmed peace-keeping forces and the double-dealing of a Western society that picks its moral fights with commodities in mind .
And when &quot; Schindler &apos;s List &quot; demanded that they never forget , one child , full of the pain of consciousness , remarked , &quot; We already forgot , otherwise how did &apos; Hotel Rwanda &apos; happen ? &quot;
As they watch more films their lives got palpably richer .
&quot; Pickpocket &quot; started a debate about criminality disenfranchisement .
&quot; To Sir , with Love &quot; ignited its teen audience .
They celebrated a change in attitude towards non-white Britons , but railed against our restless school system that does not value collective identity , unlike that offered by Sidney Poitier &apos;s careful tutelage .
By now , these thoughtful , opinionated , curious young people thought nothing of tackling films of all forms -- black and white , subtitled , documentary , non-narrative , fantasy -- and thought nothing of writing detailed reviews that competed to favor one film over another in passionate and increasingly sophisticated prose .
Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week .
From 25 clubs , we became hundreds , then thousands , until we were nearly a quarter of a million kids in 7,000 clubs right across the country .
And although the numbers were , and continue to be , extraordinary , what became more extraordinary was how the experience of critical and curious questioning translated into life .
Some of our kids started talking with their parents , others with their teachers , or with their friends .
And those without friends started making them .
The films provided communality across all manner of divide .
And the stories they held provided a shared experience .
&quot; Persepolis &quot; brought a daughter closer to her Iranian mother , and &quot; Jaws &quot; became the way in which one young boy was able to articulate the fear he &apos;d experienced in flight from violence that killed first his father then his mother , the latter thrown overboard on a boat journey .
Who was right , who wrong ?
What would they do under the same conditions ?
Was the tale told well ?
Was there a hidden message ?
How has the world changed ? How could it be different ?
A tsunami of questions flew out of the mouths of children who the world didn &apos;t think were interested .
And they themselves had not known they cared .
And as they wrote and debated , rather than seeing the films as artifacts , they began to see themselves .
I have an aunt who is a wonderful storyteller .
In a moment she can invoke images of running barefoot on Table Mountain and playing cops and robbers .
Quite recently she told me that in 1948 , two of her sisters and my father traveled on a boat to Israel without my grandparents .
When the sailors mutinied at sea in a demand for humane conditions , it was these teenagers that fed the crew .
I was past 40 when my father died .
He never mentioned that journey .
My mother &apos;s mother left Europe in a hurry without her husband , but with her three-year-old daughter and diamonds sewn into the hem of her skirt .
After two years in hiding , my grandfather appeared in London .
He was never right again .
And his story was hushed as he assimilated .
My story started in England with a clean slate and the silence of immigrant parents .
I had &quot; Anne Frank , &quot; &quot; The Great Escape , &quot; &quot; Shoah , &quot; &quot; Triumph of the Will . &quot;
It was Leni Riefenstahl in her elegant Nazi propaganda who gave context to what the family had to endure .
These films held what was too hurtful to say out loud , and they became more useful to me than the whispers of survivors and the occasional glimpse of a tattoo on a maiden aunt &apos;s wrist .
Purists may feel that fiction dissipates the quest of real human understanding , that film is too crude to tell a complex and detailed history , or that filmmakers always serve drama over truth .
But within the reels lie purpose and meaning .
As one 12-year-old said after watching &quot; Wizard of Oz , &quot; &quot; Every person should watch this , because unless you do you may not know that you too have a heart . &quot;
We honor reading , why not honor watching with the same passion ?
Consider &quot; Citizen Kane &quot; as valuable as Jane Austen .
Agree that &quot; Boyz n the Hood , &quot; like Tennyson , offers an emotional landscape and a heightened understanding that work together .
Each a piece of memorable art , each a brick in the wall of who we are .
And it &apos;s okay if we remember Tom Hanks better than astronaut Jim Lovell or have Ben Kingsley &apos;s face superimposed onto that of Gandhi &apos;s .
And though not real , Eve Harrington , Howard Beale , Mildred Pierce are an opportunity to discover what it is to be human , and no less helpful to understanding our life and times as Shakespeare is in illuminating the world of Elizabethan England .
We guessed that film , whose stories are a meeting place of drama , music , literature and human experience , would engage and inspire the young people participating in FILMCLUB .
What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior , confidence and academic achievement .
Once-reluctant students now race to school , talk to their teachers , fight , not on the playground , but to choose next week &apos;s film -- young people who have found self-definition , ambition and an appetite for education and social engagement from the stories they have witnessed .
Our members defy the binary description of how we so often describe our young .
They are neither feral nor myopically self-absorbed .
They are , like other young people , negotiating a world with infinite choice , but little culture of how to find meaningful experience .
We appeared surprised at the behaviors of those who define themselves by the size of the tick on their shoes , yet acquisition has been the narrative we have offered .
If we want different values we have to tell a different story , a story that understands that an individual narrative is an essential component of a person &apos;s identity , that a collective narrative is an essential component of a cultural identity , and without it it is impossible to imagine yourself as part of a group .
Because when these people get home after a screening of &quot; Rear Window &quot; and raise their gaze to the building next door , they have the tools to wonder who , apart from them , is out there and what is their story .
Thank you .
Ellen Jorgensen : Biohacking -- you can do it , too
We have personal computing , why not personal biotech ? That &apos;s the question biologist Ellen Jorgensen and her colleagues asked themselves before opening Genspace , a nonprofit DIYbio lab in Brooklyn devoted to citizen science , where amateurs can go and tinker with biotechnology . Far from being a sinister Frankenstein &apos;s lab , Genspace offers a long list of fun , creative and practical uses for DIYbio .
It &apos;s a great time to be a molecular biologist .
Reading and writing DNA code is getting easier and cheaper .
By the end of this year , we &apos;ll be able to sequence the three million bits of information in your genome in less than a day and for less than 1,000 euros .
Biotech is probably the most powerful and the fastest-growing technology sector .
It has the power , potentially , to replace our fossil fuels , to revolutionize medicine , and to touch every aspect of our daily lives .
So who gets to do it ?
I think we &apos;d all be pretty comfortable with this guy doing it .
But what about that guy ?
In 2009 , I first heard about DIYbio .
It &apos;s a movement that -- it advocates making biotechnology accessible to everyone , not just scientists and people in government labs .
The idea is that if you open up the science and you allow diverse groups to participate , it could really stimulate innovation .
Putting technology in the hands of the end user is usually a good idea because they &apos;ve got the best idea of what their needs are .
And here &apos;s this really sophisticated technology coming down the road , all these associated social , moral , ethical questions , and we scientists are just lousy at explaining to the public just exactly what it is we &apos;re doing in those labs .
So wouldn &apos;t it be nice if there was a place in your local neighborhood where you could go and learn about this stuff , do it hands-on ?
I thought so .
So , three years ago , I got together with some friends of mine who had similar aspirations and we founded Genspace .
It &apos;s a nonprofit , a community biotech lab in Brooklyn , New York , and the idea was people could come , they could take classes and putter around in the lab in a very open , friendly atmosphere .
None of my previous experience prepared me for what came next . Can you guess ?
The press started calling us .
And the more we talked about how great it was to increase science literacy , the more they wanted to talk about us creating the next Frankenstein , and as a result , for the next six months , when you Googled my name , instead of getting my scientific papers , you got this .
&#91; &quot; Am I a biohazard ? &quot; &#93; It was pretty depressing .
The only thing that got us through that period was that we knew that all over the world , there were other people that were trying to do the same thing that we were .
They were opening biohacker spaces , and some of them were facing much greater challenges than we did , more regulations , less resources .
But now , three years later , here &apos;s where we stand .
It &apos;s a vibrant , global community of hackerspaces , and this is just the beginning .
These are some of the biggest ones , and there are others opening every day .
There &apos;s one probably going to open up in Moscow , one in South Korea , and the cool thing is they each have their own individual flavor that grew out of the community they came out of .
Let me take you on a little tour .
Biohackers work alone .
We work in groups , in big cities ‚Äî ‚Äî and in small villages .
We reverse engineer lab equipment .
We genetically engineer bacteria .
We hack hardware , software , wetware , and , of course , the code of life .
We like to build things .
Then we like to take things apart .
We make things grow .
We make things glow .
And we make cells dance .
The spirit of these labs , it &apos;s open , it &apos;s positive , but , you know , sometimes when people think of us , the first thing that comes to mind is bio-safety , bio-security , all the dark side stuff .
I &apos;m not going to minimize those concerns .
Any powerful technology is inherently dual use , and , you know , you get something like synthetic biology , nanobiotechnology , it really compels you , you have to look at both the amateur groups but also the professional groups , because they have better infrastructure , they have better facilities , and they have access to pathogens .
So the United Nations did just that , and they recently issued a report on this whole area , and what they concluded was the power of this technology for positive was much greater than the risk for negative , and they even looked specifically at the DIYbio community , and they noted , not surprisingly , that the press had a tendency to consistently overestimate our capabilities and underestimate our ethics .
As a matter of fact , DIY people from all over the world , America , Europe , got together last year , and we hammered out a common code of ethics .
That &apos;s a lot more than conventional science has done .
Now , we follow state and local regulations .
We dispose of our waste properly , we follow safety procedures , we don &apos;t work with pathogens .
You know , if you &apos;re working with a pathogen , you &apos;re not part of the biohacker community , you &apos;re part of the bioterrorist community , I &apos;m sorry .
And sometimes people ask me , &quot; Well , what about an accident ? &quot;
Well , working with the safe organisms that we normally work with , the chance of an accident happening with somebody accidentally creating , like , some sort of superbug , that &apos;s literally about as probable as a snowstorm in the middle of the Sahara Desert .
Now , it could happen , but I &apos;m not going to plan my life around it .
I &apos;ve actually chosen to take a different kind of risk .
I signed up for something called the Personal Genome Project .
It &apos;s a study at Harvard where , at the end of the study , they &apos;re going to take my entire genomic sequence , all of my medical information , and my identity , and they &apos;re going to post it online for everyone to see .
There were a lot of risks involved that they talked about during the informed consent portion .
The one I liked the best is , someone could download my sequence , go back to the lab , synthesize some fake Ellen DNA , and plant it at a crime scene .
But like DIYbio , the positive outcomes and the potential for good for a study like that far outweighs the risk .
Now , you might be asking yourself , &quot; Well , you know , what would I do in a biolab ? &quot;
Well , it wasn &apos;t that long ago we were asking , &quot; Well , what would anyone do with a personal computer ? &quot;
So this stuff is just beginning .
We &apos;re only seeing just the tip of the DNA iceberg .
Let me show you what you could do right now .
A biohacker in Germany , a journalist , wanted to know whose dog was leaving little presents on his street ?
Yep , you guessed it . He threw tennis balls to all the neighborhood dogs , analyzed the saliva , identified the dog , and confronted the dog owner .
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard .
Looked like a ladybug , right ?
It actually is a Japanese beetle .
And the same kind of technology -- it &apos;s called DNA barcoding , it &apos;s really cool -- You can use it to check if your caviar is really beluga , if that sushi is really tuna , or if that goat cheese that you paid so much for is really goat &apos;s .
In a biohacker space , you can analyze your genome for mutations .
You can analyze your breakfast cereal for GMO &apos;s , and you can explore your ancestry .
You can send weather balloons up into the stratosphere , collect microbes , see what &apos;s up there .
You can make a biocensor out of yeast to detect pollutants in water .
You can make some sort of a biofuel cell .
You can do a lot of things .
You can also do an art science project . Some of these are really spectacular , and they look at social , ecological problems from a completely different perspective .
It &apos;s really cool .
Some people ask me , well , why am I involved ?
I could have a perfectly good career in mainstream science .
The thing is , there &apos;s something in these labs that they have to offer society that you can &apos;t find anywhere else .
There &apos;s something sacred about a space where you can work on a project , and you don &apos;t have to justify to anyone that it &apos;s going to make a lot of money , that it &apos;s going to save mankind , or even that it &apos;s feasible .
It just has to follow safety guidelines .
If you had spaces like this all over the world , it could really change the perception of who &apos;s allowed to do biotech .
It &apos;s spaces like these that spawned personal computing .
Why not personal biotech ?
If everyone in this room got involved , who knows what we could do ?
This is such a new area , and as we say back in Brooklyn , you ain &apos;t seen nothin &apos; yet .
Geert Chatrou : A whistleblower you haven &apos;t heard
In this engaging talk , world champion whistler Geert Chatrou performs the whimsical &quot; Eleonora &quot; by A. Honhoff , and his own &quot; F√™te de la Belle . &quot; In a fascinating interlude , he talks about what brought him to the craft . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Thank you very much .
That was whistling .
I &apos;m trying to do this in English .
What is a chubby , curly-haired guy from Holland -- why is he whistling ?
Well actually , I &apos;ve &#91; been &#93; whistling since the age of four , about four .
My dad was always whistling around the house , and I just thought that &apos;s part of communication in my family .
So I whistled along with him .
And actually , till I was 34 , I always annoyed and irritated people with whistling , because , to be honest , my whistling is a kind of deviant behavior .
I whistled alone . I whistled in the classroom .
I whistled on &#91; my &#93; bike . I whistled everywhere .
And I also whistled at a Christmas Eve party with my family-in-law .
And they had some , in my opinion , terrible Christmas music .
And when I hear music that I don &apos;t like , I try to make it better .
So &quot; Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer &quot; -- you know it ?
But it can also sound like this .
But during a Christmas party -- at dinner actually -- it &apos;s very annoying .
So my sister-in-law asked me a few times , &quot; Please stop whistling . &quot;
And I just couldn &apos;t .
And at one point -- and I had some wine , I have to admit that -- at one point I said , &quot; If there was a contest , I would join . &quot;
And two weeks later I received a text message : &quot; You &apos;re going to America . &quot;
So , okay , I &apos;m going to America .
I would love to , but why ?
So I immediately called her up , of course .
She Googled , and she found this World Whistling Championship in America , of course .
She didn &apos;t expect me to go there .
And I would have lost my face .
I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s correct English .
But the Dutch people here will understand what I mean .
I lost my face .
And she thought , &quot; He will never go there . &quot;
But actually I did .
So I went to Louisburg , North Carolina , southeast United States , and I entered the world of whistling .
And I also entered the world championship , and I won there in 2004 .
That was great fun , of course .
And to defend my title -- like judokas do and sportsmen -- I thought , well let &apos;s go back in 2005 , and I won again .
Then I couldn &apos;t participate for a few years .
And in 2008 I entered again in Japan , Tokyo , and I won again .
So what happened now is I &apos;m standing here in Rotterdam , in the beautiful city , on a big stage , and I &apos;m talking about whistling .
And actually I earn my money whistling at the moment .
So I quit my day job as a nurse .
And I try to live my dream -- well , actually , it was never my dream , but it sounds so good .
Okay , I &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
You say , &quot; Huh , what do you mean ? &quot;
Well actually , you are going to whistle along .
And then always the same thing happens : people are watching each other and think , &quot; Oh , my God .
Why ? Can I go away ? &quot;
No , you can &apos;t .
Actually it &apos;s very simple .
The track that I will whistle is called &quot; F√™te de la Belle . &quot;
It &apos;s about 80 minutes long .
No , no , no . It &apos;s four minutes long .
And I want to first rehearse with you your whistling .
So I whistle the tone .
Sorry . I forgot one thing .
You whistle the same tone as me .
I heard a wide variety of tones .
This is very promising .
This is very promising .
I &apos;ll ask the technicians to start the music .
And if it &apos;s started , I just point where you whistle along , and we will see what happens .
Oh , hah .
I &apos;m so sorry , technicians .
I &apos;m so used to that .
I start it myself .
Okay , here it is .
Okay .
It &apos;s easy , isn &apos;t it ?
Now comes the solo . I propose I do that myself .

Geert Chatrou : Thank you . Thank you .
Roberto D &apos;Angelo + Francesca Fedeli : In our baby &apos;s illness , a life lesson
Roberto D &apos;Angelo and Francesca Fedeli thought their baby boy Mario was healthy -- until at 10 days old , they discovered he &apos;d had a perinatal stroke . With Mario unable to control the left side of his body , they grappled with tough questions : Would he be &quot; normal ? &quot; Could he live a full life ? The poignant story of parents facing their fears -- and how they turned them around .
Francesca Fedeli : Ciao .
So he &apos;s Mario . He &apos;s our son .
He was born two and a half years ago , and I had a pretty tough pregnancy because I had to stay still in a bed for , like , eight months .
But in the end everything seemed to be under control .
So he got the right weight at birth .
He got the right Apgar index .
So we were pretty reassured by this .
But at the end , 10 days later after he was born , we discovered that he had a stroke .
As you might know , a stroke is a brain injury .
A perinatal stroke could be something that can happen during the nine months of pregnancy or just suddenly after the birth , and in his case , as you can see , the right part of his brain has gone .
So the effect that this stroke could have on Mario &apos;s body could be the fact that he couldn &apos;t be able to control the left side of his body .
Just imagine , if you have a computer and a printer and you want to transmit , to input to print out a document , but the printer doesn &apos;t have the right drives , so the same is for Mario .
It &apos;s just like , he would like to move his left side of his body , but he &apos;s not able to transmit the right input to move his left arm and left leg .
So life had to change .
We needed to change our schedule .
We needed to change the impact that this birth had on our life .
As you may imagine , unfortunately , we were not ready .
Nobody taught us how to deal with such kinds of disabilities , and as many questions as possible started to come to our minds .
And that has been really a tough time .
Questions , some basics , like , you know , why did this happen to us ?
And what went wrong ?
Some more tough , like , really , what will be the impact on Mario &apos;s life ?
I mean , at the end , will he be able to work ?
Will he be able to be normal ?
And , you know , as a parent , especially for the first time , why is he not going to be better than us ?
And this , indeed , really is tough to say , but a few months later , we realized that we were really feeling like a failure .
I mean , the only real product of our life , at the end , was a failure .
And you know , it was not a failure for ourselves in itself , but it was a failure that will impact his full life .
Honestly , we went down .
I mean we went really down , but at the end , we started to look at him , and we said , we have to react .
So immediately , as Francesca said , we changed our life .
We started physiotherapy , we started the rehabilitation , and one of the paths that we were following in terms of rehabilitation is the mirror neurons pilot .
Basically , we spent months doing this with Mario .
You have an object , and we showed him how to grab the object .
Now , the theory of mirror neurons simply says that in your brains , exactly now , as you watch me doing this , you are activating exactly the same neurons as if you do the actions .
It looks like this is the leading edge in terms of rehabilitation .
But one day we found that Mario was not looking at our hand .
He was looking at us .
We were his mirror .
And the problem , as you might feel , is that we were down , we were depressed , we were looking at him as a problem , not as a son , not from a positive perspective .
And that day really changed our perspective .
We realized that we had to become a better mirror for Mario .
We restarted from our strengths , and at the same time we restarted from his strengths .
We stopped looking at him as a problem , and we started to look at him as an opportunity to improve .
And really , this was the change , and from our side , we said , &quot; What are our strengths that we really can bring to Mario ? &quot;
And we started from our passions .
I mean , at the end , my wife and myself are quite different , but we have many things in common .
We love to travel , we love music , we love to be in places like this , and we started to bring Mario with us just to show to him the best things that we can show to him .
This short video is from last week .
I am not saying -- ‚Äî I am not saying it &apos;s a miracle . That &apos;s not the message , because we are just at the beginning of the path .
But we want to share what was the key learning , the key learning that Mario drove to us , and it is to consider what you have as a gift and not only what you miss , and to consider what you miss just as an opportunity .
And this is the message that we want to share with you .
This is why we are here .
Mario !
And this is why -- ‚Äî And this is why we decided to share the best mirror in the world with him .
And we thank you so much , all of you .
Thank you . Thank you . Bye .
Thank you .
Mark Shaw : One very dry demo
Mark Shaw demos Ultra-Ever Dry , a liquid-repellent coating that acts as an astonishingly powerful shield against water and water-based materials . At the nano level , the spray covers a surface with an umbrella of air so that water bounces right off . Watch for an exciting two-minute kicker .
I &apos;m here to show you how something you can &apos;t see can be so much fun to look at .
You &apos;re about to experience a new , available and exciting technology that &apos;s going to make us rethink how we waterproof our lives .
What I have here is a cinder block that we &apos;ve coated half with a nanotechnology spray that can be applied to almost any material .
It &apos;s called Ultra-Ever Dry , and when you apply it to any material , it turns into a superhydrophobic shield .
So this is a cinder block , uncoated , and you can see that it &apos;s porous , it absorbs water .
Not anymore .
Porous , nonporous .
So what &apos;s superhydrophobic ?
Superhydrophobic is how we measure a drop of water on a surface .
The rounder it is , the more hydrophobic it is , and if it &apos;s really round , it &apos;s superhydrophobic .
A freshly waxed car , the water molecules slump to about 90 degrees .
A windshield coating is going to give you about 110 degrees .
But what you &apos;re seeing here is 160 to 175 degrees , and anything over 150 is superhydrophobic .
So as part of the demonstration , what I have is a pair of gloves , and we &apos;ve coated one of the gloves with the nanotechnology coating , and let &apos;s see if you can tell which one , and I &apos;ll give you a hint .
Did you guess the one that was dry ?
When you have nanotechnology and nanoscience , what &apos;s occurred is that we &apos;re able to now look at atoms and molecules and actually control them for great benefits .
And we &apos;re talking really small here .
The way you measure nanotechnology is in nanometers , and one nanometer is a billionth of a meter , and to put some scale to that , if you had a nanoparticle that was one nanometer thick , and you put it side by side , and you had 50,000 of them , you &apos;d be the width of a human hair .
So very small , but very useful .
And it &apos;s not just water that this works with .
It &apos;s a lot of water-based materials like concrete , water-based paint , mud , and also some refined oils as well .
You can see the difference .
Moving onto the next demonstration , we &apos;ve taken a pane of glass and we &apos;ve coated the outside of it , we &apos;ve framed it with the nanotechnology coating , and we &apos;re going to pour this green-tinted water inside the middle , and you &apos;re going to see , it &apos;s going to spread out on glass like you &apos;d normally think it would , except when it hits the coating , it stops , and I can &apos;t even coax it to leave .
It &apos;s that afraid of the water .
So what &apos;s going on here ? What &apos;s happening ?
Well , the surface of the spray coating is actually filled with nanoparticles that form a very rough and craggly surface .
You &apos;d think it &apos;d be smooth , but it &apos;s actually not .
And it has billions of interstitial spaces , and those spaces , along with the nanoparticles , reach up and grab the air molecules , and cover the surface with air .
It &apos;s an umbrella of air all across it , and that layer of air is what the water hits , the mud hits , the concrete hits , and it glides right off .
So if I put this inside this water here , you can see a silver reflective coating around it , and that silver reflective coating is the layer of air that &apos;s protecting the water from touching the paddle , and it &apos;s dry .
So what are the applications ?
I mean , many of you right now are probably going through your head .
Everyone that sees this gets excited , and says , &quot; Oh , I could use it for this and this and this . &quot;
The applications in a general sense could be anything that &apos;s anti-wetting .
We &apos;ve certainly seen that today .
It could be anything that &apos;s anti-icing , because if you don &apos;t have water , you don &apos;t have ice .
It could be anti-corrosion .
No water , no corrosion .
It could be anti-bacterial .
Without water , the bacteria won &apos;t survive .
And it could be things that need to be self-cleaning as well .
So imagine how something like this could help revolutionize your field of work .
And I &apos;m going to leave you with one last demonstration , but before I do that , I would like to say thank you , and think small .
It &apos;s going to happen . Wait for it . Wait for it .
You guys didn &apos;t hear about us cutting out the Design from TED ?
&#91; Two minutes later ... &#93; He ran into all sorts of problems in terms of managing the medical research part .
It &apos;s happening !

Dan Ariely : Our buggy moral code
Behavioral economist Dan Ariely studies the bugs in our moral code : the hidden reasons we think it &apos;s OK to cheat or steal . Clever studies help make his point that we &apos;re predictably irrational -- and can be influenced in ways we can &apos;t grasp .
I want to talk to you today a little bit about predictable irrationality .
And my interest in irrational behavior started many years ago in the hospital .
I was burned very badly .
And if you spend a lot of time in hospital , you &apos;ll see a lot of types of irrationalities .
And the one that particularly bothered me in the burn department was the process by which the nurses took the bandage off me .
Now , you must have all taken a Band-Aid off at some point , and you must have wondered what &apos;s the right approach .
Do you rip it off quickly -- short duration but high intensity -- or do you take your Band-Aid off slowly -- you take a long time , but each second is not as painful -- which one of those is the right approach ?
The nurses in my department thought that the right approach was the ripping one , so they would grab hold and they would rip , and they would grab hold and they would rip .
And because I had 70 percent of my body burned , it would take about an hour .
And as you can imagine , I hated that moment of ripping with incredible intensity .
And I would try to reason with them and say , &quot; Why don &apos;t we try something else ?
Why don &apos;t we take it a little longer -- maybe two hours instead of an hour -- and have less of this intensity ? &quot;
And the nurses told me two things .
They told me that they had the right model of the patient -- that they knew what was the right thing to do to minimize my pain -- and they also told me that the word patient doesn &apos;t mean to make suggestions or to interfere or ...
This is not just in Hebrew , by the way .
It &apos;s in every language I &apos;ve had experience with so far .
And , you know , there &apos;s not much -- there wasn &apos;t much I could do , and they kept on doing what they were doing .
And about three years later , when I left the hospital , I started studying at the university .
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world .
So that &apos;s what I did .
I was still interested in this question of how do you take bandages off burn patients .
So originally I didn &apos;t have much money , so I went to a hardware store and I bought a carpenter &apos;s vice .
And I would bring people to the lab and I would put their finger in it , and I would crunch it a little bit .
And I would crunch it for long periods and short periods , and pain that went up and pain that went down , and with breaks and without breaks -- all kinds of versions of pain .
And when I finished hurting people a little bit , I would ask them , so , how painful was this ? Or , how painful was this ?
Or , if you had to choose between the last two , which one would you choose ?
I kept on doing this for a while .
And then , like all good academic projects , I got more funding .
I moved to sounds , electrical shocks -- I even had a pain suit that I could get people to feel much more pain .
But at the end of this process , what I learned was that the nurses were wrong .
Here were wonderful people with good intentions and plenty of experience , and nevertheless they were getting things wrong predictably all the time .
It turns out that because we don &apos;t encode duration in the way that we encode intensity , I would have had less pain if the duration would have been longer and the intensity was lower .
It turns out it would have been better to start with my face , which was much more painful , and move toward my legs , giving me a trend of improvement over time -- that would have been also less painful .
And it also turns out that it would have been good to give me breaks in the middle to kind of recuperate from the pain .
All of these would have been great things to do , and my nurses had no idea .
And from that point on I started thinking , are the nurses the only people in the world who get things wrong in this particular decision , or is it a more general case ?
And it turns out it &apos;s a more general case -- there &apos;s a lot of mistakes we do .
And I want to give you one example of one of these irrationalities , and I want to talk to you about cheating .
And the reason I picked cheating is because it &apos;s interesting , but also it tells us something , I think , about the stock market situation we &apos;re in .
So , my interest in cheating started when Enron came on the scene , exploded all of a sudden , and I started thinking about what is happening here .
Is it the case that there was kind of a few apples who are capable of doing these things , or are we talking a more endemic situation , that many people are actually capable of behaving this way ?
So , like we usually do , I decided to do a simple experiment .
And here &apos;s how it went .
If you were in the experiment , I would pass you a sheet of paper with 20 simple math problems that everybody could solve , but I wouldn &apos;t give you enough time .
When the five minutes were over , I would say , &quot; Pass me the sheets of paper , and I &apos;ll pay you a dollar per question . &quot;
People did this . I would pay people four dollars for their task -- on average people would solve four problems .
Other people I would tempt to cheat .
I would pass their sheet of paper .
When the five minutes were over , I would say , &quot; Please shred the piece of paper .
Put the little pieces in your pocket or in your backpack , and tell me how many questions you got correctly . &quot;
People now solved seven questions on average .
Now , it wasn &apos;t as if there was a few bad apples -- a few people cheated a lot .
Instead , what we saw is a lot of people who cheat a little bit .
Now , in economic theory , cheating is a very simple cost-benefit analysis .
You say , what &apos;s the probability of being caught ?
How much do I stand to gain from cheating ?
And how much punishment would I get if I get caught ?
And you weigh these options out -- you do the simple cost-benefit analysis , and you decide whether it &apos;s worthwhile to commit the crime or not .
So , we try to test this .
For some people , we varied how much money they could get away with -- how much money they could steal .
We paid them 10 cents per correct question , 50 cents , a dollar , five dollars , 10 dollars per correct question .
You would expect that as the amount of money on the table increases , people would cheat more , but in fact it wasn &apos;t the case .
We got a lot of people cheating by stealing by a little bit .
What about the probability of being caught ?
Some people shredded half the sheet of paper , so there was some evidence left .
Some people shredded the whole sheet of paper .
Some people shredded everything , went out of the room , and paid themselves from the bowl of money that had over 100 dollars .
You would expect that as the probability of being caught goes down , people would cheat more , but again , this was not the case .
Again , a lot of people cheated by just by a little bit , and they were insensitive to these economic incentives .
So we said , &quot; If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations , to these forces , what could be going on ? &quot;
And we thought maybe what is happening is that there are two forces .
At one hand , we all want to look at ourselves in the mirror and feel good about ourselves , so we don &apos;t want to cheat .
On the other hand , we can cheat a little bit , and still feel good about ourselves .
So , maybe what is happening is that there &apos;s a level of cheating we can &apos;t go over , but we can still benefit from cheating at a low degree , as long as it doesn &apos;t change our impressions about ourselves .
We call this like a personal fudge factor .
Now , how would you test a personal fudge factor ?
Initially we said , what can we do to shrink the fudge factor ?
So , we got people to the lab , and we said , &quot; We have two tasks for you today . &quot;
First , we asked half the people to recall either 10 books they read in high school , or to recall The Ten Commandments , and then we tempted them with cheating .
Turns out the people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments -- and in our sample nobody could recall all of The Ten Commandments -- but those people who tried to recall The Ten Commandments , given the opportunity to cheat , did not cheat at all .
It wasn &apos;t that the more religious people -- the people who remembered more of the Commandments -- cheated less , and the less religious people -- the people who couldn &apos;t remember almost any Commandments -- cheated more .
The moment people thought about trying to recall The Ten Commandments , they stopped cheating .
In fact , even when we gave self-declared atheists the task of swearing on the Bible and we give them a chance to cheat , they don &apos;t cheat at all .
Now , Ten Commandments is something that is hard to bring into the education system , so we said , &quot; Why don &apos;t we get people to sign the honor code ? &quot;
So , we got people to sign , &quot; I understand that this short survey falls under the MIT Honor Code . &quot;
Then they shredded it . No cheating whatsoever .
And this is particularly interesting , because MIT doesn &apos;t have an honor code .
So , all this was about decreasing the fudge factor .
What about increasing the fudge factor ?
The first experiment -- I walked around MIT and I distributed six-packs of Cokes in the refrigerators -- these were common refrigerators for the undergrads .
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators ?
As you can expect it doesn &apos;t last very long ; people take it .
In contrast , I took a plate with six one-dollar bills , and I left those plates in the same refrigerators .
No bill ever disappeared .
Now , this is not a good social science experiment , so to do it better I did the same experiment as I described to you before .
A third of the people we passed the sheet , they gave it back to us .
A third of the people we passed it to , they shredded it , they came to us and said , &quot; Mr. Experimenter , I solved X problems . Give me X dollars . &quot;
A third of the people , when they finished shredding the piece of paper , they came to us and said , &quot; Mr Experimenter , I solved X problems . Give me X tokens . &quot;
We did not pay them with dollars ; we paid them with something else .
And then they took the something else , they walked 12 feet to the side , and exchanged it for dollars .
Think about the following intuition .
How bad would you feel about taking a pencil from work home , compared to how bad would you feel about taking 10 cents from a petty cash box ?
These things feel very differently .
Would being a step removed from cash for a few seconds by being paid by token make a difference ?
Our subjects doubled their cheating .
I &apos;ll tell you what I think about this and the stock market in a minute .
But this did not solve the big problem I had with Enron yet , because in Enron , there &apos;s also a social element .
People see each other behaving .
In fact , every day when we open the news we see examples of people cheating .
What does this cause us ?
So , we did another experiment .
We got a big group of students to be in the experiment , and we prepaid them .
So everybody got an envelope with all the money for the experiment , and we told them that at the end , we asked them to pay us back the money they didn &apos;t make . OK ?
The same thing happens .
When we give people the opportunity to cheat , they cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit , all the same .
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
This acting student stood up after 30 seconds , and said , &quot; I solved everything . What do I do now ? &quot;
And the experimenter said , &quot; If you &apos;ve finished everything , go home .
That &apos;s it . The task is finished . &quot;
So , now we had a student -- an acting student -- that was a part of the group .
Nobody knew it was an actor .
And they clearly cheated in a very , very serious way .
What would happen to the other people in the group ?
Will they cheat more , or will they cheat less ?
Here is what happens .
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they &apos;re wearing .
Here is the thing .
We ran this at Carnegie Mellon and Pittsburgh .
And at Pittsburgh there are two big universities , Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh .
All of the subjects sitting in the experiment were Carnegie Mellon students .
When the actor who was getting up was a Carnegie Mellon student -- he was actually a Carnegie Mellon student -- but he was a part of their group , cheating went up .
But when he actually had a University of Pittsburgh sweatshirt , cheating went down .
Now , this is important , because remember , when the moment the student stood up , it made it clear to everybody that they could get away with cheating , because the experimenter said , &quot; You &apos;ve finished everything . Go home , &quot; and they went with the money .
So it wasn &apos;t so much about the probability of being caught again .
It was about the norms for cheating .
If somebody from our in-group cheats and we see them cheating , we feel it &apos;s more appropriate , as a group , to behave this way .
But if it &apos;s somebody from another group , these terrible people -- I mean , not terrible in this -- but somebody we don &apos;t want to associate ourselves with , from another university , another group , all of a sudden people &apos;s awareness of honesty goes up -- a little bit like The Ten Commandments experiment -- and people cheat even less .
So , what have we learned from this about cheating ?
We &apos;ve learned that a lot of people can cheat .
They cheat just by a little bit .
When we remind people about their morality , they cheat less .
When we get bigger distance from cheating , from the object of money , for example , people cheat more .
And when we see cheating around us , particularly if it &apos;s a part of our in-group , cheating goes up .
Now , if we think about this in terms of the stock market , think about what happens .
What happens in a situation when you create something where you pay people a lot of money to see reality in a slightly distorted way ?
Would they not be able to see it this way ?
Of course they would .
What happens when you do other things , like you remove things from money ?
You call them stock , or stock options , derivatives , mortgage-backed securities .
Could it be that with those more distant things , it &apos;s not a token for one second , it &apos;s something that is many steps removed from money for a much longer time -- could it be that people will cheat even more ?
And what happens to the social environment when people see other people behave around them ?
I think all of those forces worked in a very bad way in the stock market .
More generally , I want to tell you something about behavioral economics .
We have many intuitions in our life , and the point is that many of these intuitions are wrong .
The question is , are we going to test those intuitions ?
We can think about how we &apos;re going to test this intuition in our private life , in our business life , and most particularly when it goes to policy , when we think about things like No Child Left Behind , when you create new stock markets , when you create other policies -- taxation , health care and so on .
And the difficulty of testing our intuition was the big lesson I learned when I went back to the nurses to talk to them .
So I went back to talk to them and tell them what I found out about removing bandages .
And I learned two interesting things .
One was that my favorite nurse , Ettie , told me that I did not take her pain into consideration .
She said , &quot; Of course , you know , it was very painful for you .
But think about me as a nurse , taking , removing the bandages of somebody I liked , and had to do it repeatedly over a long period of time .
Creating so much torture was not something that was good for me , too . &quot;
And she said maybe part of the reason was it was difficult for her .
But it was actually more interesting than that , because she said , &quot; I did not think that your intuition was right .
I felt my intuition was correct . &quot;
So , if you think about all of your intuitions , it &apos;s very hard to believe that your intuition is wrong .
And she said , &quot; Given the fact that I thought my intuition was right ... &quot; -- she thought her intuition was right -- it was very difficult for her to accept doing a difficult experiment to try and check whether she was wrong .
But in fact , this is the situation we &apos;re all in all the time .
We have very strong intuitions about all kinds of things -- our own ability , how the economy works , how we should pay school teachers .
But unless we start testing those intuitions , we &apos;re not going to do better .
And just think about how better my life would have been if these nurses would have been willing to check their intuition , and how everything would have been better if we just start doing more systematic experimentation of our intuitions .
Thank you very much .
Jane McGonigal : Massively multi-player ‚Ä¶ thumb-wrestling ?
What happens when you get an entire audience to stand up and connect with one another ? Chaos , that &apos;s what . At least , that &apos;s what happened when Jane McGonigal tried to teach TED to play her favorite game . Then again , when the game is &quot; massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling , &quot; what else would you expect ?
Today I am going to teach you how to play my favorite game : massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling .
It &apos;s the only game in the world that I know of that allows you , the player , the opportunity to experience 10 positive emotions in 60 seconds or less .
This is true , so if you play this game with me today for just one single minute , you will get to feel joy , relief , love , surprise , pride , curiosity , excitement , awe and wonder , contentment , and creativity , all in the span of one minute .
So this sounds pretty good , right ? Now you &apos;re willing to play .
In order to teach you this game , I &apos;m going to need some volunteers to come up onstage really quickly , and we &apos;re going to do a little hands-on demo .
While they &apos;re coming up , I should let you know , this game was invented 10 years ago by an artists &apos; collective in Austria named Monochrom .
So thank you , Monochrom .
Okay , so most people are familiar with traditional , two-person thumb-wrestling .
Sunni , let &apos;s just remind them .
One , two , three , four , I declare a thumb war , and we wrestle , and of course Sunni beats me because she &apos;s the best .
Now the first thing about massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling , we &apos;re the gamer generation .
There are a billion gamers on the planet now , so we need more of a challenge .
So the first thing we need is more thumbs .
So Eric , come on over .
So we could get three thumbs together , and Peter could join us .
We could even have four thumbs together , and the way you win is you &apos;re the first person to pin someone else &apos;s thumb .
This is really important . You can &apos;t , like , wait while they fight it out and then swoop in at the last minute .
That is not how you win .
Ah , who did that ? Eric you did that .
So Eric would have won . He was the first person to pin my thumb .
Okay , so that &apos;s the first rule , and we can see that three or four is kind of the typical number of thumbs in a node , but if you feel ambitious , you don &apos;t have to hold back .
We can really go for it .
So you can see up here .
Now the only other rule you need to remember is , gamer generation , we like a challenge .
I happen to notice you all have some thumbs you &apos;re not using .
So I think we should kind of get some more involved .
And if we had just four people , we would do it just like this , and we would try and wrestle both thumbs at the same time .
Perfect .
Now , if we had more people in the room , instead of just wrestling in a closed node , we might reach out and try and grab some other people .
And in fact , that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do right now .
We &apos;re going to try and get all , something like , I don &apos;t know , 1,500 thumbs in this room connected in a single node .
And we have to connect both levels , so if you &apos;re up there , you &apos;re going to be reaching down and reaching up .
Now ‚Äî ‚Äî before we get started -- This is great . You &apos;re excited to play . ‚Äî before we get started , can I have the slides back up here really quick , because if you get good at this game , I want you to know there are some advanced levels .
So this is the kind of simple level , right ?
But there are advanced configurations .
This is called the Death Star Configuration .
Any Star Wars fans ?
And this one &apos;s called the M√∂bius Strip .
Any science geeks , you get that one .
This is the hardest level . This is the extreme .
So we &apos;ll stick with the normal one for now , and I &apos;m going to give you 30 seconds , every thumb into the node , connect the upper and the lower levels , you guys go on down there .
Thirty seconds . Into the network . Make the node .
Stand up ! It &apos;s easier if you stand up .
Everybody , up up up up up !
Stand up , my friends .
All right .
Don &apos;t start wrestling yet .
If you have a free thumb , wave it around , make sure it gets connected .
Okay . We need to do a last-minute thumb check .
If you have a free thumb , wave it around to make sure .
Grab that thumb !
Reach behind you . There you go .
Any other thumbs ?
Okay , on the count of three , you &apos;re going to go .
Try to keep track . Grab , grab , grab it .
Okay ? One , two , three , go !
Did you win ? You got it ? You got it ? Excellent !
Well done . Thank you . Thank you very much .
All right .
While you are basking in the glow of having won your first massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling game , let &apos;s do a quick recap on the positive emotions .
So curiosity .
I said &quot; massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling . &quot;
You were like , &quot; What the hell is she talking about ? &quot;
So I provoked a little curiosity .
Creativity : it took creativity to solve the problem of getting all the thumbs into the node .
I &apos;m reaching around and I &apos;m reaching up .
So you used creativity . That was great .
How about surprise ? The actual feeling of trying to wrestle two thumbs at once is pretty surprising .
You heard that sound go up in the room .
We had excitement . As you started to wrestle , maybe you &apos;re starting to win or this person &apos;s , like , really into it , so you kind of get the excitement going .
We have relief . You got to stand up .
You &apos;ve been sitting for awhile , so the physical relief , getting to shake it out .
We had joy . You were laughing , smiling . Look at your faces . This room is full of joy .
We had some contentment .
I didn &apos;t see anybody sending text messages or checking their email while we were playing , so you were totally content to be playing .
The most important three emotions , awe and wonder , we had everybody connected physically for a minute .
When was the last time you were at TED and you got to connect physically with every single person in the room ?
And it &apos;s truly awesome and wondrous .
And speaking of physical connection , you guys know I love the hormone oxytocin , you release oxytocin , you feel bonded to everyone in the room .
You guys know that the best way to release oxytocin quickly is to hold someone else &apos;s hand for at least six seconds .
You guys were all holding hands for way more than six seconds , so we are all now biochemically primed to love each other . That is great .
And the last emotion of pride .
How many people are like me . Just admit it .
You lost both your thumbs .
It just didn &apos;t work out for you .
That &apos;s okay , because you learned a new skill today .
You learned , from scratch , a game you never knew before .
Now you know how to play it . You can teach other people .
So congratulations .
How many of you won just won thumb ?
All right . I have very good news for you .
According to the official rules of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling , this makes you a grandmaster of the game .
Because there aren &apos;t that many people who know how to play , we have to kind of accelerate the program more than a game like chess .
So congratulations , grandmasters .
Win one thumb once , you will become a grandmaster .
Did anybody win both their thumbs ?
Yes . Awesome . Okay .
Get ready to update your Twitter or Facebook status .
You guys , according to the rules , are legendary grandmasters , so congratulations .
I will just leave you with this tip , if you want to play again .
The best way to become a legendary grandmaster , you &apos;ve got your two nodes going on .
Pick off the one that looks easiest .
They &apos;re not paying attention . They look kind of weak .
Focus on that one and do something crazy with this arm .
As soon as you win , suddenly stop .
Everybody is thrown off . You go in for the kill .
That &apos;s how you become a legendary grandmaster of massively multiplayer thumb-wrestling .
Thank you for letting me teach you my favorite game .
Wooo !
Thank you .
David Byrne : How architecture helped music evolve
As his career grew , David Byrne went from playing CBGB to Carnegie Hall . He asks : Does the venue make the music ? From outdoor drumming to Wagnerian operas to arena rock , he explores how context has pushed musical innovation .
This is the venue where , as a young man , some of the music that I wrote was first performed .
It was , remarkably , a pretty good sounding room .
With all the uneven walls and all the crap everywhere , it actually sounded pretty good .
This is a song that was recorded there .
This is not Talking Heads , in the picture anyway .
&quot; by Talking Heads ) So the nature of the room meant that words could be understood .
The lyrics of the songs could be pretty much understood .
The sound system was kind of decent .
And there wasn &apos;t a lot of reverberation in the room .
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
Other places around the country had similar rooms .
This is Tootsie &apos;s Orchid Lounge in Nashville .
The music was in some ways different , but in structure and form , very much the same .
The clientele behavior was very much the same too .
And so the bands at Tootsie &apos;s or at CBGB &apos;s had to play loud enough -- the volume had to be loud enough to overcome people falling down , shouting out and doing whatever else they were doing .
Since then , I &apos;ve played other places that are much nicer .
I &apos;ve played the Disney Hall here and Carnegie Hall and places like that .
And it &apos;s been very exciting .
But I also noticed that sometimes the music that I had written , or was writing at the time , didn &apos;t sound all that great in some of those halls .
We managed , but sometimes those halls didn &apos;t seem exactly suited to the music I was making or had made .
So I asked myself : Do I write stuff for specific rooms ?
Do I have a place , a venue , in mind when I write ?
Is that a kind of model for creativity ?
Do we all make things with a venue , a context , in mind ?
Okay , Africa .
Most of the popular music that we know now has a big part of its roots in West Africa .
And the music there , I would say , the instruments , the intricate rhythms , the way it &apos;s played , the setting , the context , it &apos;s all perfect . It all works perfect .
The music works perfectly in that setting .
There &apos;s no big room to create reverberation and confuse the rhythms .
The instruments are loud enough that they can be heard without amplification , etc . , etc .
It &apos;s no accident .
It &apos;s perfect for that particular context .
And it would be a mess in a context like this . This is a gothic cathedral .
In a gothic cathedral , this kind of music is perfect .
It doesn &apos;t change key , the notes are long , there &apos;s almost no rhythm whatsoever , and the room flatters the music .
It actually improves it .
This is the room that Bach wrote some of his music for . This is the organ .
It &apos;s not as big as a gothic cathedral , so he can write things that are a little bit more intricate .
He can , very innovatively , actually change keys without risking huge dissonances .
This is a little bit later .
This is the kind of rooms that Mozart wrote in .
I think we &apos;re in like 1770 , somewhere around there .
They &apos;re smaller , even less reverberant , so he can write really frilly music that &apos;s very intricate -- and it works .
It fits the room perfectly .
This is La Scala .
It &apos;s around the same time , I think it was built around 1776 .
People in the audience in these opera houses , when they were built , they used to yell out to one another .
They used to eat , drink and yell out to people on the stage , just like they do at CBGB &apos;s and places like that .
If they liked an aria , they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore , not at the end of the show , but immediately .
And well , that was an opera experience .
This is the opera house that Wagner built for himself .
And the size of the room is not that big .
It &apos;s smaller than this .
But Wagner made an innovation .
He wanted a bigger band .
He wanted a little more bombast , so he increased the size of the orchestra pit so he could get more low-end instruments in there .
Okay .
This is Carnegie Hall .
Obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
The halls got bigger . Carnegie Hall &apos;s fair-sized .
It &apos;s larger than some of the other symphony halls .
And they &apos;re a lot more reverberant than La Scala .
Around the same , according to Alex Ross who writes for the New Yorker , this kind of rule came into effect that audiences had to be quiet -- no more eating , drinking and yelling at the stage , or gossiping with one another during the show .
They had to be very quiet .
So those two things combined meant that a different kind of music worked best in these kind of halls .
It meant that there could be extreme dynamics , which there weren &apos;t in some of these other kinds of music .
Quiet parts could be heard that would have been drowned out by all the gossiping and shouting .
But because of the reverberation in those rooms like Carnegie Hall , the music had to be maybe a little less rhythmic and a little more textural .
This is Mahler .
It looks like Bob Dylan , but it &apos;s Mahler .
That was Bob &apos;s last record , yeah .
Popular music , coming along at the same time .
This is a jazz band .
According to Scott Joplin , the bands were playing on riverboats and clubs .
Again , it &apos;s noisy . They &apos;re playing for dancers .
There &apos;s certain sections of the song -- the songs had different sections that the dancers really liked .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Play that part again . &quot;
Well , there &apos;s only so many times you can play the same section of a song over and over again for the dancers .
So the bands started to improvise new melodies .
And a new form of music was born .
These are played mainly in small rooms .
People are dancing , shouting and drinking .
So the music has to be loud enough to be heard above that .
Same thing goes true for -- that &apos;s the beginning of the century -- for the whole of 20th-century popular music , whether it &apos;s rock or Latin music or whatever .
&#91; Live music &#93; doesn &apos;t really change that much .
It changes about a third of the way into the 20th century , when this became one of the primary venues for music .
And this was one way that the music got there .
Microphones enabled singers , in particular , and musicians and composers , to completely change the kind of music that they were writing .
So far , a lot of the stuff that was on the radio was live music , but singers , like Frank Sinatra , could use the mic and do things that they could never do without a microphone .
Other singers after him went even further .
This is Chet Baker .
And this kind of thing would have been impossible without a microphone .
It would have been impossible without recorded music as well .
And he &apos;s singing right into your ear .
He &apos;s whispering into your ears .
The effect is just electric .
It &apos;s like the guy is sitting next to you , whispering who knows what into your ear .
So at this point , music diverged .
There &apos;s live music , and there &apos;s recorded music .
And they no longer have to be exactly the same .
Now there &apos;s venues like this , a discotheque , and there &apos;s jukeboxes in bars , where you don &apos;t even need to have a band .
There doesn &apos;t need to be any live performing musicians whatsoever , and the sound systems are good .
People began to make music specifically for discos and for those sound systems .
And , as with jazz , the dancers liked certain sections more than they did others .
So the early hip-hop guys would loop certain sections .
The MC would improvise lyrics in the same way that the jazz players would improvise melodies .
And another new form of music was born .
Live performance , when it was incredibly successful , ended up in what is probably , acoustically , the worst sounding venues on the planet : sports stadiums , basketball arenas and hockey arenas .
Musicians who ended up there did the best they could .
They wrote what is now called arena rock , which is medium-speed ballads .
They did the best they could given that this is what they &apos;re writing for .
The tempos are medium . It sounds big .
It &apos;s more a social situation than a musical situation .
And in some ways , the music that they &apos;re writing for this place works perfectly .
So there &apos;s more new venues .
One of the new ones is the automobile .
I grew up with a radio in a car .
But now that &apos;s evolved into something else .
The car is a whole venue .
The music that , I would say , is written for automobile sound systems works perfectly on it .
It might not be what you want to listen to at home , but it works great in the car -- has a huge frequency spectrum , you know , big bass and high-end and the voice kind of stuck in the middle .
Automobile music , you can share with your friends .
There &apos;s one other kind of new venue , the private MP3 player .
Presumably , this is just for Christian music .
And in some ways it &apos;s like Carnegie Hall , or when the audience had to hush up , because you can now hear every single detail .
In other ways , it &apos;s more like the West African music because if the music in an MP3 player gets too quiet , you turn it up , and the next minute , your ears are blasted out by a louder passage .
So that doesn &apos;t really work .
I think pop music , mainly , it &apos;s written today , to some extent , is written for these kind of players , for this kind of personal experience where you can hear extreme detail , but the dynamic doesn &apos;t change that much .
So I asked myself : Okay , is this a model for creation , this adaptation that we do ?
And does it happen anywhere else ?
Well , according to David Attenborough and some other people , birds do it too -- that the birds in the canopy , where the foliage is dense , their calls tend to be high-pitched , short and repetitive .
And the birds on the floor tend to have lower pitched calls , so that they don &apos;t get distorted when they bounce off the forest floor .
And birds like this Savannah sparrow , they tend to have a buzzing type call .
And it turns out that a sound like this is the most energy efficient and practical way to transmit their call across the fields and savannahs .
Other birds , like this tanager , have adapted within the same species .
The tananger on the East Coast of the United States , where the forests are a little denser , has one kind of call , and the tananger on the other side , on the west has a different kind of call .
So birds do it too .
And I thought : Well , if this is a model for creation , if we make music , primarily the form at least , to fit these contexts , and if we make art to fit gallery walls or museum walls , and if we write software to fit existing operating systems , is that how it works ?
Yeah . I think it &apos;s evolutionary .
It &apos;s adaptive .
But the pleasure and the passion and the joy is still there .
This is a reverse view of things from the kind of traditional Romantic view .
The Romantic view is that first comes the passion and then the outpouring of emotion , and then somehow it gets shaped into something .
And I &apos;m saying , well , the passion &apos;s still there , but the vessel that it &apos;s going to be injected into and poured into , that is instinctively and intuitively created first .
We already know where that passion is going .
But this conflict of views is kind of interesting .
The writer , Thomas Frank , says that this might be a kind of explanation why some voters vote against their best interests , that voters , like a lot of us , assume , that if they hear something that sounds like it &apos;s sincere , that it &apos;s coming from the gut , that it &apos;s passionate , that it &apos;s more authentic .
And they &apos;ll vote for that .
So that , if somebody can fake sincerity , if they can fake passion , they stand a better chance which seems a little dangerous .
I &apos;m saying the two , the passion , the joy , are not mutually exclusive .
Maybe what the world needs now is for us to realize that we are like the birds .
We adapt .
We sing .
And like the birds , the joy is still there , even though we have changed what we do to fit the context .
Thank you very much .
Kevin Breel : Confessions of a depressed comic
Kevin Breel didn &apos;t look like a depressed kid : team captain , at every party , funny and confident . But he tells the story of the night he realized that -- to save his own life -- he needed to say four simple words .
For a long time in my life , I felt like I &apos;d been living two different lives .
There &apos;s the life that everyone sees , and then there &apos;s the life that only I see .
And in the life that everyone sees , who I am is a friend , a son , a brother , a stand-up comedian and a teenager .
That &apos;s the life everyone sees .
If you were to ask my friends and family to describe me , that &apos;s what they would tell you .
And that &apos;s a huge part of me . That is who I am .
And if you were to ask me to describe myself , I &apos;d probably say some of those same things .
And I wouldn &apos;t be lying , but I wouldn &apos;t totally be telling you the truth , either , because the truth is , that &apos;s just the life everyone else sees .
In the life that only I see , who I am , who I really am , is someone who struggles intensely with depression .
I have for the last six years of my life , and I continue to every day .
Now , for someone who has never experienced depression or doesn &apos;t really know what that means , that might surprise them to hear , because there &apos;s this pretty popular misconception that depression is just being sad when something in your life goes wrong , when you break up with your girlfriend , when you lose a loved one , when you don &apos;t get the job you wanted .
But that &apos;s sadness . That &apos;s a natural thing .
That &apos;s a natural human emotion .
Real depression isn &apos;t being sad when something in your life goes wrong .
Real depression is being sad when everything in your life is going right .
That &apos;s real depression , and that &apos;s what I suffer from .
And to be totally honest , that &apos;s hard for me to stand up here and say .
It &apos;s hard for me to talk about , and it seems to be hard for everyone to talk about , so much so that no one &apos;s talking about it .
And no one &apos;s talking about depression , but we need to be , because right now it &apos;s a massive problem .
It &apos;s a massive problem .
But we don &apos;t see it on social media , right ?
We don &apos;t see it on Facebook . We don &apos;t see it on Twitter .
We don &apos;t see it on the news , because it &apos;s not happy , it &apos;s not fun , it &apos;s not light .
And so because we don &apos;t see it , we don &apos;t see the severity of it .
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this : every 30 seconds , every 30 seconds , somewhere , someone in the world takes their own life because of depression , and it might be two blocks away , it might be two countries away , it might be two continents away , but it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening every single day .
And we have a tendency , as a society , to look at that and go , &quot; So what ? &quot;
So what ? We look at that , and we go , &quot; That &apos;s your problem .
That &apos;s their problem . &quot;
We say we &apos;re sad and we say we &apos;re sorry , but we also say , &quot; So what ? &quot;
Well , two years ago it was my problem , because I sat on the edge of my bed where I &apos;d sat a million times before and I was suicidal .
I was suicidal , and if you were to look at my life on the surface , you wouldn &apos;t see a kid who was suicidal .
You &apos;d see a kid who was the captain of his basketball team , the drama and theater student of the year , the English student of the year , someone who was consistently on the honor roll and consistently at every party .
So you would say I wasn &apos;t depressed , you would say I wasn &apos;t suicidal , but you would be wrong .
You would be wrong . So I sat there that night beside a bottle of pills with a pen and paper in my hand and I thought about taking my own life and I came this close to doing it .
I came this close to doing it .
And I didn &apos;t , so that makes me one of the lucky ones , one of the people who gets to step out on the ledge and look down but not jump , one of the lucky ones who survives .
Well , I survived , and that just leaves me with my story , and my story is this : In four simple words , I suffer from depression .
I suffer from depression , and for a long time , I think , I was living two totally different lives , where one person was always afraid of the other .
I was afraid that people would see me for who I really was , that I wasn &apos;t the perfect , popular kid in high school everyone thought I was , that beneath my smile , there was struggle , and beneath my light , there was dark , and beneath my big personality just hid even bigger pain .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
Some people might fear sharks . Some people might fear death .
But for me , for a large part of my life , I feared myself .
I feared my truth , I feared my honesty , I feared my vulnerability , and that fear made me feel like I was forced into a corner , like I was forced into a corner and there was only one way out , and so I thought about that way every single day .
I thought about it every single day , and if I &apos;m being totally honest , standing here I &apos;ve thought about it again since , because that &apos;s the sickness , that &apos;s the struggle , that &apos;s depression , and depression isn &apos;t chicken pox .
You don &apos;t beat it once and it &apos;s gone forever .
It &apos;s something you live with . It &apos;s something you live in .
It &apos;s the roommate you can &apos;t kick out . It &apos;s the voice you can &apos;t ignore .
It &apos;s the feelings you can &apos;t seem to escape , the scariest part is that after a while , you become numb to it . It becomes normal for you , and what you really fear the most isn &apos;t the suffering inside of you .
It &apos;s the stigma inside of others , it &apos;s the shame , it &apos;s the embarrassment , it &apos;s the disapproving look on a friend &apos;s face , it &apos;s the whispers in the hallway that you &apos;re weak , it &apos;s the comments that you &apos;re crazy .
That &apos;s what keeps you from getting help .
That &apos;s what makes you hold it in and hide it .
It &apos;s the stigma . So you hold it in and you hide it , and you hold it in and you hide it , and even though it &apos;s keeping you in bed every day and it &apos;s making your life feel empty no matter how much you try and fill it , you hide it , because the stigma in our society around depression is very real .
It &apos;s very real , and if you think that it isn &apos;t , ask yourself this : Would you rather make your next Facebook status say you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed because you hurt your back or you &apos;re having a tough time getting out of bed every morning because you &apos;re depressed ?
That &apos;s the stigma , because unfortunately , we live in a world where if you break your arm , everyone runs over to sign your cast , but if you tell people you &apos;re depressed , everyone runs the other way .
That &apos;s the stigma .
We are so , so , so accepting of any body part breaking down other than our brains . And that &apos;s ignorance .
That &apos;s pure ignorance , and that ignorance has created a world that doesn &apos;t understand depression , that doesn &apos;t understand mental health .
And that &apos;s ironic to me , because depression is one of the best documented problems we have in the world , yet it &apos;s one of the least discussed .
We just push it aside and put it in a corner and pretend it &apos;s not there and hope it &apos;ll fix itself .
Well , it won &apos;t . It hasn &apos;t , and it &apos;s not going to , because that &apos;s wishful thinking , and wishful thinking isn &apos;t a game plan , it &apos;s procrastination , and we can &apos;t procrastinate on something this important .
The first step in solving any problem is recognizing there is one .
Well , we haven &apos;t done that , so we can &apos;t really expect to find an answer when we &apos;re still afraid of the question .
And I don &apos;t know what the solution is .
I wish I did , but I don &apos;t -- but I think , I think it has to start here .
It has to start with me , it has to start with you , it has to start with the people who are suffering , the ones who are hidden in the shadows .
We need to speak up and shatter the silence .
We need to be the ones who are brave for what we believe in , because if there &apos;s one thing that I &apos;ve come to realize , if there &apos;s one thing that I see as the biggest problem , it &apos;s not in building a world where we eliminate the ignorance of others .
It &apos;s in building a world where we teach the acceptance of ourselves , where we &apos;re okay with who we are , because when we get honest , we see that we all struggle and we all suffer .
Whether it &apos;s with this , whether it &apos;s with something else , we all know what it is to hurt .
We all know what it is to have pain in our heart , and we all know how important it is to heal .
But right now , depression is society &apos;s deep cut that we &apos;re content to put a Band-Aid over and pretend it &apos;s not there .
Well , it is there . It is there , and you know what ? It &apos;s okay .
Depression is okay . If you &apos;re going through it , know that you &apos;re okay .
And know that you &apos;re sick , you &apos;re not weak , and it &apos;s an issue , not an identity , because when you get past the fear and the ridicule and the judgment and the stigma of others , you can see depression for what it really is , and that &apos;s just a part of life , just a part of life , and as much as I hate , as much as I hate some of the places , some of the parts of my life depression has dragged me down to , in a lot of ways I &apos;m grateful for it .
Because yeah , it &apos;s put me in the valleys , but only to show me there &apos;s peaks , and yeah it &apos;s dragged me through the dark but only to remind me there is light .
My pain , more than anything in 19 years on this planet , has given me perspective , and my hurt , my hurt has forced me to have hope , have hope and to have faith , faith in myself , faith in others , faith that it can get better , that we can change this , that we can speak up and speak out and fight back against ignorance , fight back against intolerance , and more than anything , learn to love ourselves , learn to accept ourselves for who we are , the people we are , not the people the world wants us to be .
Because the world I believe in is one where embracing your light doesn &apos;t mean ignoring your dark .
The world I believe in is one where we &apos;re measured by our ability to overcome adversities , not avoid them .
The world I believe in is one where I can look someone in the eye and say , &quot; I &apos;m going through hell , &quot; and they can look back at me and go , &quot; Me too , &quot; and that &apos;s okay , and it &apos;s okay because depression is okay . We &apos;re people .
We &apos;re people , and we struggle and we suffer and we bleed and we cry , and if you think that true strength means never showing any weakness , then I &apos;m here to tell you you &apos;re wrong .
You &apos;re wrong , because it &apos;s the opposite .
We &apos;re people , and we have problems .
We &apos;re not perfect , and that &apos;s okay .
So we need to stop the ignorance , stop the intolerance , stop the stigma , and stop the silence , and we need to take away the taboos , take a look at the truth , and start talking , because the only way we &apos;re going to beat a problem that people are battling alone is by standing strong together , by standing strong together .
And I believe that we can .
I believe that we can . Thank you guys so much .
This is a dream come true . Thank you .
Thank you .
Ronny Edry : Israel and Iran : A love story ?
When war between Israel and Iran seemed imminent , Israeli graphic designer Ronny Edry shared a poster on Facebook of himself and his daughter with a bold message : &quot; Iranians ... we &#91; heart &#93; you . &quot; Other Israelis quickly created their own posters with the same message -- and Iranians responded in kind . The simple act of communication inspired surprising Facebook communities like &quot; Israel loves Iran , &quot; &quot; Iran loves Israel &quot; and even &quot; Palestine loves Israel . &quot;
On March 14 , this year , I posted this poster on Facebook .
This is an image of me and my daughter holding the Israeli flag .
I will try to explain to you about the context of why and when I posted .
A few days ago , I was sitting waiting on the line at the grocery store , and the owner and one of the clients were talking to each other , and the owner was explaining to the client that we &apos;re going to get 10,000 missiles on Israel .
And the client was saying , no , it &apos;s 10,000 a day .
This is the context . This is where we are now in Israel .
We have this war with Iran coming for 10 years now , and we have people , you know , afraid .
It &apos;s like every year it &apos;s the last minute that we can do something about the war with Iran .
It &apos;s like , if we don &apos;t act now , it &apos;s too late forever , for 10 years now .
So at some point it became , you know , to me , I &apos;m a graphic designer , so I made posters about it and I posted the one I just showed you before .
Most of the time , I make posters , I post them on Facebook , my friends like it , don &apos;t like it , most of the time don &apos;t like it , don &apos;t share it , don &apos;t nothing , and it &apos;s another day .
So I went to sleep , and that was it for me .
And later on in the night , I woke up because I &apos;m always waking up in the night , and I went by the computer and I see all these red dots , you know , on Facebook , which I &apos;ve never seen before .
And I was like , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
So I come to the computer and I start looking on , and suddenly I see many people talking to me , most of them I don &apos;t know , and a few of them from Iran , which is -- What ?
Because you have to understand , in Israel we don &apos;t talk with people from Iran .
We don &apos;t know people from Iran .
It &apos;s like , on Facebook , you have friends only from -- it &apos;s like your neighbors are your friends on Facebook .
And now people from Iran are talking to me .
So I start answering this girl , and she &apos;s telling me she saw the poster and she asked her family to come , because they don &apos;t have a computer , she asked her family to come to see the poster , and they &apos;re all sitting in the living room crying .
So I &apos;m like , whoa .
I ask my wife to come , and I tell her , you have to see that .
People are crying , and she came , she read the text , and she started to cry .
And everybody &apos;s crying now .
So I don &apos;t know what to do , so my first reflex , as a graphic designer , is , you know , to show everybody what I &apos;d just seen , and people started to see them and to share them , and that &apos;s how it started .
The day after , when really it became a lot of talking , I said to myself , and my wife said to me , I also want a poster , so this is her .
Because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
But more seriously , I was like , okay , these ones work , but it &apos;s not just about me , it &apos;s about people from Israel who want to say something .
So I &apos;m going to shoot all the people I know , if they want , and I &apos;m going to put them in a poster and I &apos;m going to share them .
So I went to my neighbors and friends and students and I just asked them , give me a picture , I will make you a poster .
And that &apos;s how it started . And that &apos;s how , really , it &apos;s unleashed , because suddenly people from Facebook , friends and others , just understand that they can be part of it .
It &apos;s not just one dude making one poster , it &apos;s -- we can be part of it , so they start sending me pictures and ask me , &quot; Make me a poster . Post it .
Tell the Iranians we from Israel love you too . &quot;
It became , you know , at some point it was really , really intense .
I mean , so many pictures , so I asked friends to come , graphic designers most of them , to make posters with me , because I didn &apos;t have the time .
It was a huge amount of pictures .
So for a few days , that &apos;s how my living room was .
And we received Israeli posters , Israeli images , but also lots of comments , lots of messages from Iran .
And we took these messages and we made posters out of it , because I know people : They don &apos;t read , they see images .
If it &apos;s an image , they may read it .
So here are a few of them .
This one is really moving for me because it &apos;s the story of a girl who has been raised in Iran to walk on an Israeli flag to enter her school every morning , and now that she sees the posters that we &apos;re sending , she starts -- she said that she changed her mind , and now she loves that blue , she loves that star , and she loves that flag , talking about the Israeli flag , and she wished that we &apos;d meet and come to visit one another , and just a few days after I posted the first poster .
The day after , Iranians started to respond with their own posters .
They have graphic designers . What ?
Crazy , crazy .
So you can see they are still shy , they don &apos;t want to show their faces , but they want to spread the message .
They want to respond . They want to say the same thing .
So . And now it &apos;s communication .
It &apos;s a two-way story . It &apos;s Israelis and Iranians sending the same message , one to each other .
This never happened before , and this is two people supposed to be enemies , we &apos;re on the verge of a war , and suddenly people on Facebook are starting to say , &quot; I like this guy . I love those guys . &quot;
And it became really big at some point .
And then it became news .
Because when you &apos;re seeing the Middle East , you see only the bad news .
And suddenly , there is something that was happening that was good news . So the guys on the news , they say , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s talk about this . &quot;
I remember one day , Michal , she was talking with the journalist , and she was asking him , &quot; Who &apos;s gonna see the show ? &quot; And he said , &quot; Everybody . &quot;
So she said , &quot; Everybody in Palestine , in where ? Israel ?
Who is everybody ? &quot; &quot; Everybody . &quot;
They said , &quot; Syria ? &quot; &quot; Syria . &quot;
&quot; Lebanon ? &quot; &quot; Lebanon . &quot;
At some point , he just said , &quot; 40 million people are going to see you today .
It &apos;s everybody . &quot; The Chinese .
And we were just at the beginning of the story .
Something crazy also happened .
Every time a country started talking about it , like Germany , America , wherever , a page on Facebook popped up with the same logo with the same stories , so at the beginning we had &quot; Iran-Loves-Israel , &quot; which is an Iranian sitting in Tehran , saying , &quot; Okay , Israel loves Iran ?
I give you Iran-Loves-Israel . &quot;
You have Palestine-Loves-Israel .
You have Lebanon that just -- a few days ago .
And this whole list of pages on Facebook dedicated to the same message , to people sending their love , one to each other .
The moment I really understood that something was happening , a friend of mine told me , &quot; Google the word &apos; Israel . &apos; &quot; And those were the first images on those days that popped up from Google when you were typing , &quot; Israel &quot; or &quot; Iran . &quot;
We really changed how people see the Middle East .
Because you &apos;re not in the Middle East .
You &apos;re somewhere over there , and then you want to see the Middle East , so you go on Google and you say , &quot; Israel , &quot; and they give you the bad stuff .
And for a few days you got those images .
Today the Israel-Loves-Iran page is this number , 80,831 , and two million people last week went on the page and shared , liked , I don &apos;t know , commented on one of the photos .
So for five months now , that &apos;s what we are doing , me , Michal , a few of my friends , are just making images .
We &apos;re showing a new reality by just making images because that &apos;s how the world perceives us .
They see images of us , and they see bad images .
So we &apos;re working on making good images . End of story .
Look at this one . This is the Iran-Loves-Israel page .
This is not the Israel-Loves-Iran . This is not my page .
This is a guy in Tehran on the day of remembrance of the Israeli fallen soldier putting an image of an Israeli soldier on his page .
This is the enemy .
What ?
And it &apos;s going both ways .
It &apos;s like , we are showing respect , one to each other .
And we &apos;re understanding . And you show compassion .
And you become friends .
And at some point , you become friends on Facebook , and you become friends in life .
You can go and travel and meet people .
And I was in Munich a few weeks ago .
I went there to open an exposition about Iran and I met there with people from the page that told me , &quot; Okay , you &apos;re going to be in Europe , I &apos;m coming . I &apos;m coming from France , from Holland , from Germany , &quot; of course , and from Israel people came , and we just met there for the first time in real life .
I met with people that are supposed to be my enemies for the first time . And we just shake hands , and have a coffee and a nice discussion , and we talk about food and basketball .
And that was the end of it .
Remember that image from the beginning ?
At some point we met in real life , and we became friends .
And it goes the other way around .
Some girl that we met on Facebook never been in Israel , born and raised in Iran , lives in Germany , afraid of Israelis because of what she knows about us , decides after a few months of talking on the Internet with some Israelis to come to Israel , and she gets on the plane and arrives at Ben Gurion and says , &quot; Okay , not that big a deal . &quot;
So a few weeks ago , the stress is getting higher , so we start this new campaign called &quot; Not ready to die in your war . &quot;
I mean , it &apos;s plus / minus the same message , but we wanted really to add some aggressivity to it .
And again , something amazing happened , something that we didn &apos;t have on the first wave of the campaign .
Now people from Iran , the same ones who were shy at the first campaign and just sent , you know , their foot and half their faces , now they &apos;re sending their faces , and they &apos;re saying , &quot; Okay , no problem , we &apos;re into it . We are with you . &quot;
Just read where those guys are from .
And for every guy from Israel , you &apos;ve got someone from Iran .
Just people sending their pictures .
Crazy , yes ?
So -- So you may ask yourself , who is this dude ?
My name is Ronny Edry , and I &apos;m 41 , I &apos;m an Israeli , I &apos;m a father of two , I &apos;m a husband , and I &apos;m a graphic designer . I &apos;m teaching graphic design .
And I &apos;m not that naive , because a lot of the time I &apos;ve been asked , many times I &apos;ve been asked , &quot; Yeah , but , this is really naive , sending flowers over , I mean ‚Äî &quot; I was in the army . I was in the paratroopers for three years , and I know how it looks from the ground .
I know how it can look really bad .
So to me , this is the courageous thing to do , to try to reach the other side before it &apos;s too late , because when it &apos;s going to be too late , it &apos;s going to be too late .
And sometimes war is inevitable , sometimes , but maybe &#91; with &#93; effort , we can avoid it .
Maybe as people , because especially in Israel , we &apos;re in a democracy . We have the freedom of speech , and maybe that little thing can change something .
And really , we can be our own ambassadors .
We can just send a message and hope for the best .
So I want to ask Michal , my wife , to come with me on the stage just to make with you one image , because it &apos;s all about images .
And maybe that image will help us change something .
Just raise that . Exactly .
And I &apos;m just going to take a picture of it , and I &apos;m just going to post it on Facebook with kind of &quot; Israelis for peace &quot; or something .
Oh my God .
Don &apos;t cry .
Thank you guys .
Charles Moore : Seas of plastic
Capt. Charles Moore of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation first discovered the Great Pacific Garbage Patch -- an endless floating waste of plastic trash . Now he &apos;s drawing attention to the growing , choking problem of plastic debris in our seas .
Let &apos;s talk trash .
You know , we had to be taught to renounce the powerful conservation ethic we developed during the Great Depression and World War II .
After the war , we needed to direct our enormous production capacity toward creation of products for peacetime .
Life Magazine helped in this effort by announcing the introduction of throwaways that would liberate the housewife from the drudgery of doing dishes .
Mental note to the liberators : throwaway plastics take a lot of space and don &apos;t biodegrade .
Only we humans make waste that nature can &apos;t digest .
Plastics are also hard to recycle .
A teacher told me how to express the under-five-percent of plastics recovered in our waste stream .
It &apos;s diddly-point-squat .
That &apos;s the percentage we recycle .
Now , melting point has a lot to do with this .
Plastic is not purified by the re-melting process like glass and metal .
It begins to melt below the boiling point of water and does not drive off the oily contaminants for which it is a sponge .
Half of each year &apos;s 100 billion pounds of thermal plastic pellets will be made into fast-track trash .
A large , unruly fraction of our trash will flow downriver to the sea .
Here is the accumulation at Biona Creek next to the L.A. airport .
And here is the flotsam near California State University Long Beach and the diesel plant we visited yesterday .
In spite of deposit fees , much of this trash leading out to the sea will be plastic beverage bottles .
We use two million of them in the United States every five minutes , here imaged by TED presenter Chris Jordan , who artfully documents mass consumption and zooms in for more detail .
Here is a remote island repository for bottles off the coast of Baja California .
Isla San Roque is an uninhabited bird rookery off Baja &apos;s sparsely populated central coast .
Notice that the bottles here have caps on them .
Bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate , PET , will sink in seawater and not make it this far from civilization .
Also , the caps are produced in separate factories from a different plastic , polypropylene .
They will float in seawater , but unfortunately do not get recycled under the bottle bills .
Let &apos;s trace the journey of the millions of caps that make it to sea solo .
After a year the ones from Japan are heading straight across the Pacific , while ours get caught in the California current and first head down to the latitude of Cabo San Lucas .
After ten years , a lot of the Japanese caps are in what we call the Eastern Garbage Patch , while ours litter the Philippines .
After 20 years , we see emerging the debris accumulation zone of the North Pacific Gyre .
It so happens that millions of albatross nesting on Kure and Midway atolls in the Northwest Hawaiian Islands National Monument forage here and scavenge whatever they can find for regurgitation to their chicks .
A four-month old Laysan Albatross chick died with this in its stomach .
Hundreds of thousands of the goose-sized chicks are dying with stomachs full of bottle caps and other rubbish , like cigarette lighters ...
but , mostly bottle caps .
Sadly , their parents mistake bottle caps for food tossing about in the ocean surface .
The retainer rings for the caps also have consequences for aquatic animals .
This is Mae West , still alive at a zookeeper &apos;s home in New Orleans .
I wanted to see what my home town of Long Beach was contributing to the problem , so on Coastal Clean-Up Day in 2005 I went to the Long Beach Peninsula , at the east end of our long beach .
We cleaned up the swaths of beach shown .
I offered five cents each for bottle caps .
I got plenty of takers .
Here are the 1,100 bottle caps they collected .
I thought I would spend 20 bucks .
That day I ended up spending nearly 60 .
I separated them by color and put them on display the next Earth Day at Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro .
Governor Schwarzenegger and his wife Maria stopped by to discuss the display .
In spite of my &quot; girly man &quot; hat , crocheted from plastic shopping bags , they shook my hand .
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton .
Here &apos;s what our trawl samples from the plastic soup our ocean has become look like .
Trawling a zooplankton net on the surface for a mile produces samples like this .
And this .
Now , when the debris washes up on the beaches of Hawaii it looks like this .
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach , the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington .
Now , how do we analyze samples like this one that contain more plastic than plankton ?
We sort the plastic fragments into different size classes , from five millimeters to one-third of a millimeter .
Small bits of plastic concentrate persistent organic pollutants up to a million times their levels in the surrounding seawater .
We wanted to see if the most common fish in the deep ocean , at the base of the food chain , was ingesting these poison pills .
We did hundreds of necropsies , and over a third had polluted plastic fragments in their stomachs .
The record-holder , only two-and-a-half inches long , had 84 pieces in its tiny stomach .
Now , you can buy certified organic produce .
But no fishmonger on Earth can sell you a certified organic wild-caught fish .
This is the legacy we are leaving to future generations .
The throwaway society cannot be contained -- it has gone global .
We simply cannot store and maintain or recycle all our stuff .
We have to throw it away .
Now , the market can do a lot for us , but it can &apos;t fix the natural system in the ocean we &apos;ve broken .
All the king &apos;s horses and all the king &apos;s men ...
will never gather up all the plastic and put the ocean back together again .
Narrator : The levels are increasing , the amount of packaging is increasing , the &quot; throwaway &quot; concept of living is proliferating , and it &apos;s showing up in the ocean .
Anchor : He offers no hope of cleaning it up .
Straining the ocean for plastic would be beyond the budget of any country and it might kill untold amounts of sea life in the process .
The solution , Moore says , is to stop the plastic at its source : stop it on land before it falls in the ocean .
And in a plastic-wrapped and packaged world , he doesn &apos;t hold out much hope for that , either .
This is Brian Rooney for Nightline , in Long Beach , California .
Charles Moore : Thank you .
Carolyn Steel : How food shapes our cities
Every day , in a city the size of London , 30 million meals are served . But where does all the food come from ? Architect Carolyn Steel discusses the daily miracle of feeding a city , and shows how ancient food routes shaped the modern world .
How do you feed a city ?
It &apos;s one of the great questions of our time .
Yet it &apos;s one that &apos;s rarely asked .
We take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant , or indeed into this theater &apos;s foyer in about an hour &apos;s time , there is going to be food there waiting for us , having magically come from somewhere .
But when you think that every day for a city the size of London , enough food has to be produced , transported , bought and sold , cooked , eaten , disposed of , and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth , it &apos;s remarkable that cities get fed at all .
We live in places like this as if they &apos;re the most natural things in the world , forgetting that because we &apos;re animals and that we need to eat , we &apos;re actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were .
And as more of us move into cities , more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it &apos;s soybean fields in Mato Grosso in Brazil -- in order to feed us .
These are extraordinary landscapes , but few of us ever get to see them .
And increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either .
As more of us move into cities , more of us are eating meat , so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals .
And given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it &apos;s passed through an animal first , that &apos;s not a very efficient way of feeding us .
And it &apos;s an escalating problem too .
By 2050 , it &apos;s estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities .
And it &apos;s also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed .
So meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand .
And that &apos;s going to pose an enormous problem .
Six billion hungry carnivores to feed , by 2050 .
That &apos;s a big problem . And actually if we carry on as we are , it &apos;s a problem we &apos;re very unlikely to be able to solve .
Nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land .
Although at the same time we &apos;re losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion .
We &apos;re very hungry for fossil fuels too .
It takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the West .
And even though there is food that we are producing at great cost , we don &apos;t actually value it .
Half the food produced in the USA is currently thrown away .
And to end all of this , at the end of this long process , we &apos;re not even managing to feed the planet properly .
A billion of us are obese , while a further billion starve .
None of it makes very much sense .
And when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations , it &apos;s a grim picture .
As we &apos;re moving into cities , the world is also embracing a Western diet .
And if we look to the future , it &apos;s an unsustainable diet .
So how did we get here ?
And more importantly , what are we going to do about it ?
Well , to answer the slightly easier question first , about 10,000 years ago , I would say , is the beginning of this process in the ancient Near East , known as the Fertile Crescent .
Because , as you can see , it was crescent shaped .
And it was also fertile .
And it was here , about 10,000 years ago , that two extraordinary inventions , agriculture and urbanism , happened roughly in the same place and at the same time .
This is no accident , because agriculture and cities are bound together . They need each other .
Because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements .
And if we look at what those settlements were like , we see they were compact .
They were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at Ur , that were , in fact , effectively , spiritualized , central food distribution centers .
Because it was the temples that organized the harvest , gathered in the grain , offered it to the gods , and then offered the grain that the gods didn &apos;t eat back to the people .
So , if you like , the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them .
And in fact , that &apos;s true of every ancient city .
But of course not all of them were that small .
Famously , Rome had about a million citizens by the first century A.D.
So how did a city like this feed itself ?
The answer is what I call &quot; ancient food miles . &quot;
Basically , Rome had access to the sea , which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away .
This is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world , because it was very difficult to transport food over roads , which were rough .
And the food obviously went off very quickly .
So Rome effectively waged war on places like Carthage and Egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves .
And , in fact , you could say that the expansion of the Empire was really sort of one long , drawn out militarized shopping spree , really .
In fact -- I love the fact , I just have to mention this : Rome in fact used to import oysters from London , at one stage . I think that &apos;s extraordinary .
So Rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite .
But the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world .
If we look at a map of London in the 17th century , we can see that its grain , which is coming in from the Thames , along the bottom of this map .
So the grain markets were to the south of the city .
And the roads leading up from them to Cheapside , which was the main market , were also grain markets .
And if you look at the name of one of those streets , Bread Street , you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago .
And the same of course was true for fish .
Fish was , of course , coming in by river as well . Same thing .
And of course Billingsgate , famously , was London &apos;s fish market , operating on-site here until the mid-1980s .
Which is extraordinary , really , when you think about it .
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port .
This is another thing about food in cities : Once its roots into the city are established , they very rarely move .
Meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city .
So much of London &apos;s meat was coming from the northwest , from Scotland and Wales .
So it was coming in , and arriving at the city at the northwest , which is why Smithfield , London &apos;s very famous meat market , was located up there .
Poultry was coming in from East Anglia and so on , to the northeast .
I feel a bit like a weather woman doing this . Anyway , and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes .
And then when they hit the eastern end of Cheapside , that &apos;s where they were sold , which is why it &apos;s called Poultry .
And , in fact , if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age , you can trace food coming in to it .
You can actually see how it was physically shaped by food , both by reading the names of the streets , which give you a lot of clues .
Friday Street , in a previous life , is where you went to buy your fish on a Friday .
But also you have to imagine it full of food .
Because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold .
And if we look at an image of Smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from .
In fact , if you were having Sunday lunch , the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier .
So this was obviously an organic city , part of an organic cycle .
And then 10 years later everything changed .
This is an image of the Great Western in 1840 .
And as you can see , some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep .
So all of a sudden , these animals are no longer walking into market .
They &apos;re being slaughtered out of sight and mind , somewhere in the countryside .
And they &apos;re coming into the city by rail .
And this changes everything .
To start off with , it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities , really any size and shape , in any place .
Cities used to be constrained by geography ; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means .
All of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography .
And as you can see from these maps of London , in the 90 years after the trains came , it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot , and so on , to a large splurge , that would be very , very difficult to feed with anybody on foot , either animals or people .
And of course that was just the beginning . After the trains came cars , and really this marks the end of this process .
It &apos;s the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
And this is the kind of city that &apos;s devoid of smell , devoid of mess , certainly devoid of people , because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape .
In fact , what they did to get food was they got in their cars , drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts , came back with a week &apos;s worth of shopping , and wondered what on earth to do with it .
And this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
Here we have food -- that used to be the center , the social core of the city -- at the periphery .
It used to be a social event , buying and selling food .
Now it &apos;s anonymous .
We used to cook ; now we just add water , or a little bit of an egg if you &apos;re making a cake or something .
We don &apos;t smell food to see if it &apos;s okay to eat .
We just read the back of a label on a packet .
And we don &apos;t value food . We don &apos;t trust it .
So instead of trusting it , we fear it .
And instead of valuing it , we throw it away .
One of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they &apos;ve made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder .
By making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place , they &apos;ve actually distanced us from our most important relationship , which is that of us and nature .
And also they &apos;ve made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver , that , as we &apos;ve seen , are unsustainable .
So what are we going to do about that ?
It &apos;s not a new question .
500 years ago it &apos;s what Thomas More was asking himself .
This is the frontispiece of his book &quot; Utopia . &quot;
And it was a series of semi-independent city-states , if that sounds remotely familiar , a day &apos;s walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad , and grew vegetables in their back gardens , and ate communal meals together , and so on .
And I think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of Utopia , even though More never framed it that way .
And here is another very famous &quot; Utopian &quot; vision , that of Ebenezer Howard , &quot; The Garden City . &quot;
Same idea : series of semi-independent city-states , little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around , joined to one another by railway .
the ordering principle of his vision .
It even got built , but nothing to do with this vision that Howard had .
And that is the problem with these Utopian ideas , that they are Utopian .
Utopia was actually a word that Thomas Moore used deliberately .
It was a kind of joke , because it &apos;s got a double derivation from the Greek .
It can either mean a good place , or no place .
Because it &apos;s an ideal . It &apos;s an imaginary thing . We can &apos;t have it .
And I think , as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling , that makes it not much use .
So I &apos;ve come up with an alternative , which is Sitopia , from the ancient Greek , &quot; sitos &quot; for food , and &quot; topos &quot; for place .
I believe we already live in Sitopia .
We live in a world shaped by food , and if we realize that , we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool , design tool , to shape the world differently .
So if we were to do that , what might Sitopia look like ?
Well I think it looks a bit like this .
I have to use this slide . It &apos;s just the look on the face of the dog .
But anyway , this is -- it &apos;s food at the center of life , at the center of family life , being celebrated , being enjoyed , people taking time for it .
This is where food should be in our society .
But you can &apos;t have scenes like this unless you have people like this .
By the way , these can be men as well .
It &apos;s people who think about food , who think ahead , who plan , who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them .
We need these people . We &apos;re part of a network .
Because without these kinds of people we can &apos;t have places like this .
Here , I deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable .
But networks , markets where food is being grown locally .
It &apos;s common . It &apos;s fresh .
It &apos;s part of the social life of the city .
Because without that , you can &apos;t have this kind of place , food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape , and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole .
Cows with a view .
Steaming piles of humus .
This is basically bringing the whole thing together .
And this is a community project I visited recently in Toronto .
It &apos;s a greenhouse , where kids get told all about food and growing their own food .
Here is a plant called Kevin , or maybe it &apos;s a plant belonging to a kid called Kevin . I don &apos;t know .
But anyway , these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important .
So Sitopia , for me , is really a way of seeing .
It &apos;s basically recognizing that Sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere .
The trick is to join them up , to use food as a way of seeing .
And if we do that , we &apos;re going to stop seeing cities as big , metropolitan , unproductive blobs , like this .
We &apos;re going to see them more like this , as part of the productive , organic framework of which they are inevitably a part , symbiotically connected .
But of course , that &apos;s not a great image either , because we need not to be producing food like this anymore .
We need to be thinking more about permaculture , which is why I think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing .
It &apos;s a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives .
The best image I know of this is from 650 years ago .
It &apos;s Ambrogio Lorenzetti &apos;s &quot; Allegory of Good Government . &quot;
It &apos;s about the relationship between the city and the countryside .
And I think the message of this is very clear .
If the city looks after the country , the country will look after the city .
And I want us to ask now , what would Ambrogio Lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today ?
What would an allegory of good government look like today ?
Because I think it &apos;s an urgent question .
It &apos;s one we have to ask , and we have to start answering .
We know we are what we eat .
We need to realize that the world is also what we eat .
But if we take that idea , we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better .
Thank you very much .
Eddi Reader : &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill &quot;
Singer / songwriter Eddi Reader performs &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill , &quot; a tender look back at a lost love . With Thomas Dolby on piano .
This is about a place in London called Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill where I used to go and spend hours going &quot; When is he coming back ? When is he coming back ? &quot;
So this is another one dedicated to that guy ...
who I &apos;ve got over .
But this is &quot; Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill . &quot;
It &apos;s a beautiful song written by a guy called Martin Evan , actually , for me .
Boo Hewerdine , Thomas Dolby , thank you very much for inviting me . It &apos;s been a blessing singing for you .
Thank you very much .
Do you remember when we used to go up to Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill ? Those summer nights , so still with all of the city beneath us and all of our lives ahead before cruel and foolish words were cruelly and foolishly said Some nights I think of you and then I go up on Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill wrapped up against the winter chill And somewhere in the city beneath me you lie asleep in your bed and I wonder if ever just briefly do I creep in your dreams now and then Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Have the years been kind ? And do you think of me sometimes up on Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill ? Oh , I pray you one day will We won &apos;t say a word We won &apos;t need them Sometimes silence is best We &apos;ll just stand in the still of the evening and whisper farewell to loneliness Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Do you think of me sometimes ? And do you ever make that climb ? Where are you now ? My wild summer love Where are you now ? Have the years been kind ? And do you ever make that climb up on Kiteflyer &apos;s Hill ? Kiteflyer &apos;s ... &#91; French &#93; Where are you ? Where are you now ? Where are you now ? Kiteflyer &apos;s ... Gracias . Thank you very much .
Christopher C. Deam : The Airstream , restyled
In this low-key , image-packed talk from 2002 , designer Christopher C. Deam talks about his makeover of an American classic : the Airstream travel trailer .
a plastic laminate company , which is the largest plastic laminate company in the world -- they asked me to design a trade show booth for exhibition at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair in New York , in 2000 .
So looking at their three main markets for their product which were basically transportation design , interiors and furniture , we came up with the solution of taking an old Airstream trailer and gutting it , and trying to portray laminate , and a trailer , in kind of a fresh , new contemporary look .
When this trailer showed up at my shop in Berkeley , I &apos;d actually never stepped foot in an Airstream trailer , or any other trailer .
So I can be somebody that can look at this in a totally fresh perspective and see if I can optimize it in its most idealistic fashion .
I decided I had to do some research and really figure out what had gone wrong somewhere along the history of Airstream .
What I discovered in these interiors is that there was a disconnect between the exterior shell and the interior architecture of the pieces .
In that the shell was originally conceived as a lightweight , modern , futuristic , high-tech pod for hurtling down the freeway , and the interiors were completely out of sync with that .
In fact it appeared like they referenced a mountain cabin .
That seemed really like a crisis to me , that they had never been able to develop a vocabulary about escape , and about travel , and modernity in this trailer that was consistent with the shell .
We really needed to do some archeology in the trailer itself to figure out what &apos;s authentic in an Airstream trailer , and what feels like it has true purpose and utility .
We stripped out all the vinyl and zolatone paint that was covering up this just fantastic aluminum shell .
We took off all the visible hardware and trim that was kind of doing the country cabin thing .
I literally drew on the walls of the trailer , mocked it up in cardboard , we &apos;d come in and cut , decide things were wrong , pull it out , put it back in .
The main goal was to smooth out the interior , and begin to speak about motion , and mobility , and independence .
The biggest difficulty on one of these trailers is that when you &apos;re designing there &apos;s actually no logical place to stop and start materials because of the continuous form of the trailer .
There &apos;s no such things as two walls and a ceiling coming together , where you can change materials and shapes .
So that became a challenge .
Compounding that , the material of choice , laminate , that I was trying to highlight , only bends in two dimensions .
It &apos;s a compound curve interior .
What I had to devise was a way of fooling the eye into believing that all these panels are curved with the shell .
What I came up with was a series of second skins that basically float over the aluminum shell .
And what I was trying to do there was direct your eye in the space , so that you would perceive the geometry in a different way , and that the casework wouldn &apos;t break up the space .
They also gave us a way to run power and rewire the trailer without tearing out the skin , so they function as an electrical chase .
That &apos;s the trailer , pretty much finished .
That trailer led to another commission , to participate in whats called Tokyo Designers Block .
Its a week of furniture design events in Tokyo , in October .
Teruo Kurosaki , who owns a furniture company called Idee , he asked me to ship him two trailers to Tokyo .
He said one he would like to make a real trailer , functioning , and we would sell that one .
Trailer number two , you have a blank slate , you can to anything you want .
We came up with a fantasy scenario of a DJ traveling around the States , that would collect records and go on tours .
This trailer housed two turntables , mixer , wet bar , fridge , integrated sound system .
It &apos;s got a huge couch , fits quite a few people , and basically we &apos;d had a great time with this .
And so in this trailer I took it upon myself to think about travel , and escape , in an idiosyncratic sense .
A lot of these ideas migrated into the production trailers for Airstream .
This brings us up to the time that I started consulting to Airstream .
They came to me and said , &quot; Well , what can we do to freshen this thing up ?
And do you think kids , you know , skateboarders , surfers , rock climbers , would use these things ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , not in that interior . &quot;
Anyway , I went out to Airstream about six times during the process of building this prototype , and it &apos;s called the Bambi prototype .
I thought , &quot; Finally , oh yeah great , big company , I &apos;m gonna work with somebody with money for tooling and molding . &quot;
And I walked in their prototype facility , and it &apos;s exactly like my shop , only bigger -- same tools , same things .
So the problem became -- and they set this dilemma to me -- that you have to design the interior using only our existing technology , and there &apos;s no money for tooling or molding .
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built .
All the casework is hand-scribed in , uniquely , so you can &apos;t just cut 100 parts for 100 trailers , you have to cut them big , and every single one is hand-fit .
They didn &apos;t want to go to a componentized system .
And there it is , that &apos;s the Bambi 16 .
Elliot Krane : The mystery of chronic pain
We think of pain as a symptom , but there are cases where the nervous system develops feedback loops and pain becomes a terrifying disease in itself . Starting with the story of a girl whose sprained wrist turned into a nightmare , Elliot Krane talks about the complex mystery of chronic pain , and reviews the facts we &apos;re just learning about how it works and how to treat it .
I &apos;m a pediatrician and an anesthesiologist , so I put children to sleep for a living .
And I &apos;m an academic , so I put audiences to sleep for free .
But what I actually mostly do is I manage the pain management service at the Packard Children &apos;s Hospital up at Stanford in Palo Alto .
And it &apos;s from the experience from about 20 or 25 years of doing that that I want to bring to you the message this morning , that pain is a disease .
Now most of the time , you think of pain as a symptom of a disease , and that &apos;s true most of the time .
It &apos;s the symptom of a tumor or an infection or an inflammation or an operation .
But about 10 percent of the time , after the patient has recovered from one of those events , pain persists .
It persists for months and oftentimes for years , and when that happens , it is its own disease .
And before I tell you about how it is that we think that happens and what we can do about it , I want to show you how it feels for my patients .
So imagine , if you will , that I &apos;m stroking your arm with this feather , as I &apos;m stroking my arm right now .
Now , I want you to imagine that I &apos;m stroking it with this .
Please keep your seat .
A very different feeling .
Now what does it have to do with chronic pain ?
Imagine , if you will , these two ideas together .
Imagine what your life would be like if I were to stroke it with this feather , but your brain was telling you that this is what you are feeling -- and that is the experience of my patients with chronic pain .
In fact , imagine something even worse .
Imagine I were to stroke your child &apos;s arm with this feather , and their brain &#91; was &#93; telling them that they were feeling this hot torch .
That was the experience of my patient , Chandler , whom you see in the photograph .
As you can see , she &apos;s a beautiful , young woman .
She was 16 years old last year when I met her , and she aspired to be a professional dancer .
And during the course of one of her dance rehearsals , she fell on her outstretched arm and sprained her wrist .
Now you would probably imagine , as she did , that a wrist sprain is a trivial event in a person &apos;s life .
Wrap it in an ACE bandage , take some ibuprofen for a week or two , and that &apos;s the end of the story .
But in Chandler &apos;s case , that was the beginning of the story .
This is what her arm looked like when she came to my clinic about three months after her sprain .
You can see that the arm is discolored , purplish in color .
It was cadaverically cold to the touch .
The muscles were frozen , paralyzed -- dystonic is how we refer to that .
The pain had spread from her wrist to her hands , to her fingertips , from her wrist up to her elbow , almost all the way to her shoulder .
But the worst part was , not the spontaneous pain that was there 24 hours a day .
The worst part was that she had allodynia , the medical term for the phenomenon that I just illustrated with the feather and with the torch .
The lightest touch of her arm -- the touch of a hand , the touch even of a sleeve , of a garment , as she put it on -- caused excruciating , burning pain .
How can the nervous system get this so wrong ?
How can the nervous system misinterpret an innocent sensation like the touch of a hand and turn it into the malevolent sensation of the touch of the flame ?
Well you probably imagine that the nervous system in the body is hardwired like your house .
In your house , wires run in the wall , from the light switch to a junction box in the ceiling and from the junction box to the light bulb .
And when you turn the switch on , the light goes on .
And when you turn the switch off , the light goes off .
So people imagine the nervous system is just like that .
If you hit your thumb with a hammer , these wires in your arm -- that , of course , we call nerves -- transmit the information into the junction box in the spinal cord where new wires , new nerves , take the information up to the brain where you become consciously aware that your thumb is now hurt .
But the situation , of course , in the human body is far more complicated than that .
Instead of it being the case that that junction box in the spinal cord is just simple where one nerve connects with the next nerve by releasing these little brown packets of chemical information called neurotransmitters in a linear one-on-one fashion , in fact , what happens is the neurotransmitters spill out in three dimensions -- laterally , vertically , up and down in the spinal cord -- and they start interacting with other adjacent cells .
These cells , called glial cells , were once thought to be unimportant structural elements of the spinal cord that did nothing more than hold all the important things together , like the nerves .
But it turns out the glial cells have a vital role in the modulation , amplification and , in the case of pain , the distortion of sensory experiences .
These glial cells become activated .
Their DNA starts to synthesize new proteins , which spill out and interact with adjacent nerves , and they start releasing their neurotransmitters , and those neurotransmitters spill out and activate adjacent glial cells , and so on and so forth , until what we have is a positive feedback loop .
It &apos;s almost as if somebody came into your home and rewired your walls so that the next time you turned on the light switch , the toilet flushed three doors down , or your dishwasher went on , or your computer monitor turned off .
That &apos;s crazy , but that &apos;s , in fact , what happens with chronic pain .
And that &apos;s why pain becomes its own disease .
The nervous system has plasticity .
It changes , and it morphs in response to stimuli .
Well , what do we do about that ?
What can we do in a case like Chandler &apos;s ?
We treat these patients in a rather crude fashion at this point in time .
We treat them with symptom-modifying drugs -- painkillers -- which are , frankly , not very effective for this kind of pain .
We take nerves that are noisy and active that should be quiet , and we put them to sleep with local anesthetics .
And most importantly , what we do is we use a rigorous , and often uncomfortable , process of physical therapy and occupational therapy to retrain the nerves in the nervous system to respond normally to the activities and sensory experiences that are part of everyday life .
And we support all of that with an intensive psychotherapy program to address the despondency , despair and depression that always accompanies severe , chronic pain .
It &apos;s successful , as you can see from this video of Chandler , who , two months after we first met her , is now doings a back flip .
And I had lunch with her yesterday because she &apos;s a college student studying dance at Long Beach here , and she &apos;s doing absolutely fantastic .
But the future is actually even brighter .
The future holds the promise that new drugs will be developed that are not symptom-modifying drugs that simply mask the problem , as we have now , but that will be disease-modifying drugs that will actually go right to the root of the problem and attack those glial cells , or those pernicious proteins that the glial cells elaborate , that spill over and cause this central nervous system wind-up , or plasticity , that so is capable of distorting and amplifying the sensory experience that we call pain .
So I have hope that in the future , the prophetic words of George Carlin will be realized , who said , &quot; My philosophy : No pain , no pain . &quot;
Thank you very much .
Bruce Aylward : How we &apos;ll stop polio for good
Polio is almost completely eradicated . But as Bruce Aylward says : Almost isn &apos;t good enough with a disease this terrifying . Aylward lays out the plan to continue the scientific miracle that ended polio in most of the world -- and to snuff it out everywhere , forever .
I want to share with you over the next 18 minutes a pretty incredible idea .
Actually , it &apos;s a really big idea .
But to get us started , I want to ask if everyone could just close your eyes for two seconds and try and think of a technology or a bit of science that you think has changed the world .
Now I bet , in this audience , you &apos;re thinking of some really incredible technology , some stuff that I haven &apos;t even heard of , I &apos;m absolutely sure .
But I &apos;m also sure , pretty sure , that absolutely nobody is thinking of this .
This is a polio vaccine .
And it &apos;s a great thing actually that nobody &apos;s had to think about it here today because it means that we can take this for granted .
This is a great technology .
We can take it completely for granted .
But it wasn &apos;t always that way .
Even here in California , if we were to go back just a few years , it was a very different story .
People were terrified of this disease .
They were terrified of polio , and it would cause public panic .
And it was because of scenes like this .
In this scene , people are living in an iron lung .
These are people who were perfectly healthy two or three days before , and then two days later , they can no longer breathe , and this polio virus has paralyzed not only their arms and their legs , but also their breathing muscles .
And they were going to spend the rest of their lives , usually , in this iron lung to breathe for them .
This disease was terrifying .
There was no cure , and there was no vaccine .
The disease was so terrifying that the president of the United States launched an extraordinary national effort to find a way to stop it .
Twenty years later , they succeeded and developed the polio vaccine .
It was hailed as a scientific miracle in the late 1950s .
Finally , a vaccine that could stop this awful disease , and here in the United States it had an incredible impact .
As you can see , the virus stopped , and it stopped very , very fast .
But this wasn &apos;t the case everywhere in the world .
And it happened so fast in the United States , however , that even just last month Jon Stewart said this : Jon Stewart : Where is polio still active ?
Because I thought that had been eradicated in the way that smallpox had been eradicated .
Bruce Aylward : Oops . Jon , polio &apos;s almost been eradicated .
But the reality is that polio still exists today .
We made this map for Jon to try to show him exactly where polio still exists .
This is the picture .
There &apos;s not very much left in the world .
But the reason there &apos;s not very much left is because there &apos;s been an extraordinary public / private partnership working behind the scenes , almost unknown , I &apos;m sure to most of you here today .
It &apos;s been working for 20 years to try and eradicate this disease , and it &apos;s got it down to these few cases that you can see here on this graphic .
But just last year , we had an incredible shock and realized that almost just isn &apos;t good enough with a virus like polio .
And this is the reason : in two countries that hadn &apos;t had this disease for more than probably a decade , on opposite sides of the globe , there was suddenly terrible polio outbreaks .
Hundreds of people were paralyzed .
Hundreds of people died -- children as well as adults .
And in both cases , we were able to use genetic sequencing to look at the polio viruses , and we could tell these viruses were not from these countries .
They had come from thousands of miles away .
And in one case , it originated on another continent .
And not only that , but when they came into these countries , then they got on commercial jetliners probably and they traveled even farther to other places like Russia , where , for the first time in over a decade last year , children were crippled and paralyzed by a disease that they had not seen for years .
Now all of these outbreaks that I just showed you , these are under control now , and it looks like they &apos;ll probably stop very , very quickly .
But the message was very clear .
Polio is still a devastating , explosive disease .
It &apos;s just happening in another part of the world .
And our big idea is that the scientific miracle of this decade should be the complete eradication of poliomyelitis .
So I want to tell you a little bit about what this partnership , the Polio Partnership , is trying to do .
We &apos;re not trying to control polio .
We &apos;re not trying to get it down to just a few cases , because this disease is like a root fire ; it can explode again if you don &apos;t snuff it out completely .
So what we &apos;re looking for is a permanent solution .
We want a world in which every child , just like you guys , can take for granted a polio-free world .
So we &apos;re looking for a permanent solution , and this is where we get lucky .
This is one of the very few viruses in the world where there are big enough cracks in its armor that we can try to do something truly extraordinary .
This virus can only survive in people .
It can &apos;t live for a very long time in people .
It doesn &apos;t survive in the environment hardly at all .
And we &apos;ve got pretty good vaccines , as I &apos;ve just showed you .
So we are trying to wipe out this virus completely .
What the polio eradication program is trying to do is to kill the virus itself that causes polio everywhere on Earth .
Now we don &apos;t have a great track record when it comes to doing something like this , to eradicating diseases .
It &apos;s been tried six times in the last century , and it &apos;s been successful exactly once .
And this is because disease eradication , it &apos;s still the venture capital of public health .
The risks are massive , but the pay-off -- economic , humanitarian , motivational -- it &apos;s absolutely huge .
One congressman here in the United States thinks that the entire investment that the U.S. put into smallpox eradication pays itself off every 26 days -- in foregone treatment costs and vaccination costs .
And if we can finish polio eradication , the poorest countries in the world are going to save over 50 billion dollars in the next 25 years alone .
So those are the kind of stakes that we &apos;re after .
But smallpox eradication was hard ; it was very , very hard .
And polio eradication , in many ways , is even tougher , and there &apos;s a few reasons for that .
The first is that , when we started trying to eradicate polio about 20 years ago , more than twice as many countries were infected than had been when we started off with smallpox .
And there were more than 10 times as many people living in these countries .
So it was a massive effort .
The second challenge we had was -- in contrast to the smallpox vaccine , which was very stable , and a single dose protected you for life -- the polio vaccine is incredibly fragile .
It deteriorates so quickly in the tropics that we &apos;ve had to put this special vaccine monitor on every single vial so that it will change very quickly when it &apos;s exposed to too much heat , and we can tell that it &apos;s not a good vaccine to use on a child -- it &apos;s not potent ; it &apos;s not going to protect them .
Even then , kids need many doses of the vaccine .
But the third challenge we have -- and probably even bigger one , the biggest challenge -- is that , in contrast to smallpox where you could always see your enemy -- every single person almost who was infected with smallpox had this telltale rash .
So you could get around the disease ; you could vaccinate around the disease and cut it off .
With polio it &apos;s almost completely different .
The vast majority of people who are infected with the polio virus show absolutely no sign of the disease .
So you can &apos;t see the enemy most of the time , and as a result , we &apos;ve needed a very different approach to eradicate polio than what was done with smallpox .
We &apos;ve had to create one of the largest social movements in history .
There &apos;s over 10 million people , probably 20 million people , largely volunteers , who have been working over the last 20 years in what has now been called the largest internationally-coordinated operation in peacetime .
These people , these 20 million people , vaccinate over 500 million children every single year , multiple times at the peak of our operation .
Now giving the polio vaccine is simple .
It &apos;s just two drops , like that .
But reaching 500 million people is much , much tougher .
And these vaccinators , these volunteers , they have got to dive headlong into some of the toughest , densest urban slums in the world .
They &apos;ve got to trek under sweltering suns to some of the most remote , difficult to reach places in the world .
And they also have to dodge bullets , because we have got to operate during shaky cease-fires and truces to try and vaccinate children , even in areas affected by conflict .
One reporter who was watching our program in Somalia about five years ago -- a place which has eradicated polio , not once , but twice , because they got reinfected .
He was sitting outside of the road , watching one of these polio campaigns unfold , and a few months later he wrote : &quot; This is foreign aid at its most heroic . &quot;
And these heroes , they come from every walk of life , all sorts of backgrounds .
But one of the most extraordinary is Rotary International .
This is a group whose million-strong army of volunteers have been working to eradicate polio for over 20 years .
They &apos;re right at the center of the whole thing .
Now it took years to build up the infrastructure for polio eradication -- more than 15 years , much longer than it should have -- but once it was built , the results were striking .
Within a couple of years , every country that started polio eradication rapidly eradicated all three of their polio viruses , with the exception of four countries that you see here .
And in each of those , it was only part of the country .
And then , by 1999 , one of the three polio viruses that we were trying to eradicate had been completely eradicated worldwide -- proof of concept .
And then today , there &apos;s been a 99 percent reduction -- greater than 99 percent reduction -- in the number of children who are being paralyzed by this awful disease .
When we started , over 20 years ago , 1,000 children were being paralyzed every single day by this virus .
Last year , it was 1,000 .
And at the same time , the polio eradication program has been working to help with a lot of other areas .
It &apos;s been working to help control pandemic flu , SARS for example .
It &apos;s also tried to save children by doing other things -- giving vitamin A drops , giving measles shots , giving bed nets against malaria even during some of these campaigns .
But the most exciting thing that the polio eradication program has been doing has been to force us , the international community , to reach every single child , every single community , the most vulnerable people in the world , with the most basic of health services , irrespective of geography , poverty , culture and even conflict .
So things were looking very exciting , and then about five years ago , this virus , this ancient virus , started to fight back .
The first problem we ran into was that , in these last four countries , the strongholds of this virus , we just couldn &apos;t seem to get the virus rooted out .
And then to make the matters even worse , the virus started to spread out of these four places , especially northern India and northern Nigeria , into much of Africa , Asia , and even into Europe , causing horrific outbreaks in places that had not seen this disease for decades .
And then , in one of the most important , tenacious and toughest reservoirs of the polio virus in the world , we found that our vaccine was working half as well as it should have .
In conditions like this , the vaccine just couldn &apos;t get the grip it needed to in the guts of these children and protect them the way that it needed to .
Now at that time , there was a great , as you can imagine , frustration -- let &apos;s call it frustration -- it started to grow very , very quickly .
And all of a sudden , some very important voices in the world of public health started to say , &quot; Hang on .
We should abandon this idea of eradication .
Let &apos;s settle for control -- that &apos;s good enough . &quot;
Now as seductive as the idea of control sounds , it &apos;s a false premise .
The brutal truth is , if we don &apos;t have the will or the skill , or even the money that we need to reach children , the most vulnerable children in the world , with something as simple as an oral polio vaccine , then pretty soon , more than 200,000 children are again going to be paralyzed by this disease every single year .
There &apos;s absolutely no question .
These are children like Umar .
Umar is seven years old , and he &apos;s from northern Nigeria .
He lives in a family home there with his eight brothers and sisters .
Umar also has polio .
Umar was paralyzed for life .
His right leg was paralyzed in 2004 .
This leg , his right leg , now takes an awful beating because he has to half-crawl , because it &apos;s faster to move that way to keep up with his friends , keep up with his brothers and sisters , than to get up on his crutches and walk .
But Umar is a fantastic student . He &apos;s an incredible kid .
As you probably can &apos;t see the detail here , but this is his report card , and you &apos;ll see , he &apos;s got perfect scores .
He got 100 percent in all the important things , like nursery rhymes , for example there .
But you know I &apos;d love to be able to tell you that Umar is a typical kid with polio these days , but it &apos;s not true .
Umar is an exceptional kid in exceptional circumstances .
The reality of polio today is something very different .
Polio strikes the poorest communities in the world .
It leaves their children paralyzed , and it drags their families deeper into poverty , because they &apos;re desperately searching and they &apos;re desperately spending the little bit of savings that they have , trying in vain to find a cure for their children .
We think children deserve better .
And so when the going got really tough in the polio eradication program about two years ago , when people were saying , &quot; We should call it off , &quot; the Polio Partnership decided to buckle down once again and try and find innovative new solutions , new ways to get to the children that we were missing again and again .
In northern India , we started mapping the cases using satellite imaging like this , so that we could guide our investments and vaccinator shelters , so we could get to the millions of children on the Koshi River basin where there are no other health services .
In northern Nigeria , the political leaders and the traditional Muslim leaders , they got directly involved in the program to help solve the problems of logistics and community confidence .
And now they &apos;ve even started using these devices -- speaking of cool technology -- these little devices , little GIS trackers like this , which they put into the vaccine carriers of their vaccinators .
And then they can track them , and at the end of the day , they look and see , did these guys get every single street , every single house .
This is the kind of commitment now we &apos;re seeing to try and reach all of the children we &apos;ve been missing .
And in Afghanistan , we &apos;re trying new approaches -- access negotiators .
We &apos;re working closely with the International Committee of the Red Cross to ensure that we can reach every child .
But as we tried these extraordinary things , as people went to this trouble to try and rework their tactics , we went back to the vaccine -- it &apos;s a 50-year-old vaccine -- and we thought , surely we can make a better vaccine , so that when they finally get to these kids , we can have a better bang for our buck .
And this started an incredible collaboration with industry , and within six months , we were testing a new polio vaccine that targeted , just two years ago , the last two types of polio in the world .
Now June the ninth , 2009 , we got the first results from the first trial with this vaccine , and it turned out to be a game-changer .
The new vaccine had twice the impact on these last couple of viruses as the old vaccine had , and we immediately started using this .
Well , in a couple of months we had to get it out of production .
And it started rolling off the production lines and into the mouths of children around the world .
And we didn &apos;t start with the easy places .
The first place this vaccine was used was in southern Afghanistan , because it &apos;s in places like that where kids are going to benefit the most from technologies like this .
Now here at TED , over the last couple of days , I &apos;ve seen people challenging the audience again and again to believe in the impossible .
So this morning at about seven o &apos;clock , I decided that we &apos;d try to drive Chris and the production crew here berserk by downloading all of our data from India again , so that you could see something that &apos;s just unfolding today , which proves that the impossible is possible .
And only two years ago , people were saying that this is impossible .
Now remember , northern India is the perfect storm when it comes to polio .
Over 500,000 children are born in the two states that have never stopped polio -- Uttar Pradesh and Bihar -- 500,000 children every single month .
Sanitation is terrible , and our old vaccine , you remember , worked half as well as it should have .
And yet , the impossible is happening .
Today marks exactly six months -- and for the first time in history , not a single child has been paralyzed in Uttar Pradesh or Bihar .
India &apos;s not unique .
In Umar &apos;s home country of Nigeria , a 95 percent reduction in the number of children paralyzed by polio last year .
And in the last six months , we &apos;ve had less places reinfected by polio than at any other time in history .
Ladies and gentlemen , with a combination of smart people , smart technology and smart investments , polio can now be eradicated anywhere .
We have major challenges , you can imagine , to finish this job , but as you &apos;ve also seen , it &apos;s doable , it has great secondary benefits , and polio eradication is a great buy .
And as long as any child anywhere is paralyzed by this virus , it &apos;s a stark reminder that we are failing , as a society , to reach children with the most basic of services .
And for that reason , polio eradication : it &apos;s the ultimate in equity and it &apos;s the ultimate in social justice .
The huge social movement that &apos;s been involved in polio eradication is ready to do way more for these children .
It &apos;s ready to reach them with bed nets , with other things .
But capitalizing on their enthusiasm , capitalizing on their energy means finishing the job that they started 20 years ago .
Finishing polio is a smart thing to do , and it &apos;s the right thing to do .
Now we &apos;re in tough times economically .
But as David Cameron of the United Kingdom said about a month ago when he was talking about polio , &quot; There &apos;s never a wrong time to do the right thing . &quot;
Finishing polio eradication is the right thing to do .
And we are at a crossroads right now in this great effort over the last 20 years .
We have a new vaccine , we have new resolve , and we have new tactics .
We have the chance to write an entirely new polio-free chapter in human history .
But if we blink now , we will lose forever the chance to eradicate an ancient disease .
Here &apos;s a great idea to spread : End polio now .
Help us tell the story .
Help us build the momentum so that very soon every child , every parent everywhere can also take for granted a polio-free life forever .
Thank you .
Bill Gates : Well Bruce , where do you think the toughest places are going to be ?
Where would you say we need to be the smartest ?
B The four places where you saw , that we &apos;ve never stopped -- northern Nigeria , northern India , the southern corner of Afghanistan and bordering areas of Pakistan -- they &apos;re going to be the toughest .
But the interesting thing is , of those three , India &apos;s looking real good , as you just saw in the data .
And Afghanistan , Afghanistan , we think has probably stopped polio repeatedly .
It keeps getting reinfected .
So the tough ones : going to get the top of Nigeria finished and getting Pakistan finished .
They &apos;re going to be the tough ones .
Now what about the money ?
Give us a sense of how much the campaign costs a year .
And is it easy to raise that money ?
And what &apos;s it going to be like the next couple of years ?
B It &apos;s interesting .
We spend right now about 750 million to 800 million dollars a year .
That &apos;s what it costs to reach 500 million children .
It sounds like a lot of money ; it is a lot of money .
But when you &apos;re reaching 500 million children multiple times -- 20 , 30 cents to reach a child -- that &apos;s not very much money .
But right now we don &apos;t have enough of that .
We have a big gap in that money . We &apos;re cutting corners , and every time we cut corners , more places get infected that shouldn &apos;t have , and it just slows us down .
And that great buy costs us a little bit more .
Well , hopefully we &apos;ll get the word out , and the governments will keep their generosity up .
So good luck . We &apos;re all in this with you .
Thank you .
Frank Warren : Half a million secrets
&quot; Secrets can take many forms -- they can be shocking , or silly , or soulful . &quot; Frank Warren , the founder of PostSecret.com , shares some of the half-million secrets that strangers have mailed him on postcards .
Hi , my name is Frank , and I collect secrets .
It all started with a crazy idea in November of 2004 .
I printed up 3,000 self-addressed postcards , just like this .
They were blank on one side , and on the other side I listed some simple instructions .
I asked people to anonymously share an artful secret they &apos;d never told anyone before .
And I handed out these postcards randomly on the streets of Washington , D.C. , not knowing what to expect .
But soon the idea began spreading virally .
People began to buy their own postcards and make their own postcards .
I started receiving secrets in my home mailbox , not just with postmarks from Washington , D.C. , but from Texas , California , Vancouver , New Zealand , Iraq .
Soon my crazy idea didn &apos;t seem so crazy .
PostSecret.com is the most visited advertisement-free blog in the world .
And this is my postcard collection today .
You can see my wife struggling to stack a brick of postcards on a pyramid of over a half-million secrets .
What I &apos;d like to do now is share with you a very special handful of secrets from that collection , starting with this one .
&quot; I found these stamps as a child , and I have been waiting all my life to have someone to send them to .
I never did have someone . &quot;
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
They can connect us to our deepest humanity or with people we &apos;ll never meet .
Maybe one of you sent this one in .
I don &apos;t know .
This one does a great job of demonstrating the creativity that people have when they make and mail me a postcard .
This one obviously was made out of half a Starbucks cup with a stamp and my home address written on the other side .
&quot; Dear Birthmother , I have great parents .
I &apos;ve found love . I &apos;m happy . &quot;
Secrets can remind us of the countless human dramas , of frailty and heroism , playing out silently in the lives of people all around us even now .
&quot; Everyone who knew me before 9 / 11 believes I &apos;m dead . &quot;
&quot; I used to work with a bunch of uptight religious people , so sometimes I didn &apos;t wear panties , and just had a big smile and chuckled to myself . &quot;
This next one takes a little explanation before I share it with you .
I love to speak on college campuses and share secrets and the stories with students .
And sometimes afterwards I &apos;ll stick around and sign books and take photos with students .
And this next postcard was made out of one of those photos .
And I should also mention that , just like today , at that PostSecret event , I was using a wireless microphone .
&quot; Your mic wasn &apos;t off during sound check .
We all heard you pee . &quot;
This was really embarrassing when it happened , until I realized it could have been worse .
Right . You know what I &apos;m saying .
&quot; Inside this envelope is the ripped up remains of a suicide note I didn &apos;t use .
I feel like the happiest person on Earth &quot; &quot; One of these men is the father of my son .
He pays me a lot to keep it a secret . &quot;
&quot; That Saturday when you wondered where I was , well , I was getting your ring .
It &apos;s in my pocket right now . &quot;
I had this postcard posted on the PostSecret blog two years ago on Valentine &apos;s Day .
It was the very bottom , the last secret in the long column .
And it hadn &apos;t been up for more than a couple hours before I received this exuberant email from the guy who mailed me this postcard .
And he said , &quot; Frank , I &apos;ve got to share with you this story that just played out in my life . &quot;
He said , &quot; My knees are still shaking . &quot;
He said , &quot; For three years , my girlfriend and I , we &apos;ve made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud .
I read some to her , she reads some to me . &quot;
He says , &quot; It &apos;s really brought us closer together through the years .
And so when I discovered that you had posted my surprise proposal to my girlfriend at the very bottom , I was beside myself .
And I tried to act calm , not to give anything away .
And just like every Sunday , we started reading the secrets out loud to each other . &quot;
He said , &quot; But this time it seemed like it was taking her forever to get through each one . &quot;
But she finally did .
She got to that bottom secret , his proposal to her .
And he said , &quot; She read it once and then she read it again . &quot;
And she turned to him and said , &quot; Is that our cat ? &quot;
And when she saw him , he was down on one knee , he had the ring out .
He popped the question , she said yes . It was a very happy ending .
So I emailed him back and I said , &quot; Please share with me an image , something , that I can share with the whole PostSecret community and let everyone know your fairy tale ending . &quot;
And he emailed me this picture .
&quot; I found your camera at Lollapalooza this summer .
I finally got the pictures developed and I &apos;d love to give them to you . &quot;
This picture never got returned back to the people who lost it , but this secret has impacted many lives , starting with a student up in Canada named Matty .
Matty was inspired by that secret to start his own website , a website called IFoundYourCamera .
Matty invites people to mail him digital cameras that they &apos;ve found , memory sticks that have been lost with orphan photos .
And Matty takes the pictures off these cameras and posts them on his website every week .
And people come to visit to see if they can identify a picture they &apos;ve lost or help somebody else get the photos back to them that they might be desperately searching for .
This one &apos;s my favorite .
Matty has found this ingenious way to leverage the kindness of strangers .
And it might seem like a simple idea , and it is , but the impact it can have on people &apos;s lives can be huge .
Matty shared with me an emotional email he received from the mother in that picture .
&quot; That &apos;s me , my husband and son .
The other pictures are of my very ill grandmother .
Thank you for making your site .
These pictures mean more to me than you know .
My son &apos;s birth is on this camera .
He turns four tomorrow . &quot;
Every picture that you see there and thousands of others have been returned back to the person who lost it -- sometimes crossing oceans , sometimes going through language barriers .
This is the last postcard I have to share with you today .
&quot; When people I love leave voicemails on my phone I always save them in case they die tomorrow and I have no other way of hearing their voice ever again . &quot;
When I posted this secret , dozens of people sent voicemail messages from their phones , sometimes ones they &apos;d been keeping for years , messages from family or friends who had died .
They said that by preserving those voices and sharing them , it helped them keep the spirit of their loved ones alive .
One young girl posted the last message she ever heard from her grandmother .
Secrets can take many forms .
They can be shocking or silly or soulful .
They can connect us with our deepest humanity or with people we &apos;ll never meet again .
Voicemail recording : First saved voice message .
It &apos;s somebody &apos;s birthday today Somebody &apos;s birthday today The candles are lighted on somebody &apos;s cake And we &apos;re all invited for somebody &apos;s sake You &apos;re 21 years old today .
Have a real happy birthday , and I love you .
I &apos;ll say bye for now .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Frank , that was beautiful , so touching .
Have you ever sent yourself a postcard ?
Have you ever sent in a secret to PostSecret ?
I have one of my own secrets in every book .
I think in some ways , the reason I started the project , even though I didn &apos;t know it at the time , was because I was struggling with my own secrets .
And it was through crowd-sourcing , it was through the kindness that strangers were showing me , that I could uncover parts of my past that were haunting me .
And has anyone ever discovered which secret was yours in the book ?
Has anyone in your life been able to tell ?
Sometimes I share that information , yeah .
Tony Porter : A call to men
At TEDWomen , Tony Porter makes a call to men everywhere : Don &apos;t &quot; act like a man . &quot; Telling powerful stories from his own life , he shows how this mentality , drummed into so many men and boys , can lead men to disrespect , mistreat and abuse women and each other . His solution : Break free of the &quot; man box . &quot;
I grew up in New York City , between Harlem and the Bronx .
Growing up as a boy , we were taught that men had to be tough , had to be strong , had to be courageous , dominating -- no pain , no emotions , with the exception of anger -- and definitely no fear ; that men are in charge , which means women are not ; that men lead , and you should just follow and do what we say ; that men are superior ; women are inferior ; that men are strong ; women are weak ; that women are of less value , property of men , and objects , particularly sexual objects .
I &apos;ve later come to know that to be the collective socialization of men , better known as the &quot; man box . &quot;
See this man box has in it all the ingredients of how we define what it means to be a man .
Now I also want to say , without a doubt , there are some wonderful , wonderful , absolutely wonderful things about being a man .
But at the same time , there &apos;s some stuff that &apos;s just straight up twisted , and we really need to begin to challenge , look at it and really get in the process of deconstructing , redefining , what we come to know as manhood .
This is my two at home , Kendall and Jay .
They &apos;re 11 and 12 .
Kendall &apos;s 15 months older than Jay .
There was a period of time when my wife -- her name is Tammie -- and I , we just got real busy and whip , bam , boom : Kendall and Jay .
And when they were about five and six , four and five , Jay could come to me , come to me crying .
It didn &apos;t matter what she was crying about , she could get on my knee , she could snot my sleeve up , just cry , cry it out .
Daddy &apos;s got you . That &apos;s all that &apos;s important .
Now Kendall on the other hand -- and like I said , he &apos;s only 15 months older than her -- he &apos;d come to me crying , it &apos;s like as soon as I would hear him cry , a clock would go off .
I would give the boy probably about 30 seconds , which means , by the time he got to me , I was already saying things like , &quot; Why are you crying ?
Hold your head up . Look at me .
Explain to me what &apos;s wrong .
Tell me what &apos;s wrong . I can &apos;t understand you .
Why are you crying ? &quot;
And out of my own frustration of my role and responsibility of building him up as a man to fit into these guidelines and these structures that are defining this man box , I would find myself saying things like , &quot; Just go in your room .
Just go on , go on in your room .
Sit down , get yourself together and come back and talk to me when you can talk to me like a -- &quot; what ?
Like a man .
And he &apos;s five years old .
And as I grow in life , I would say to myself , &quot; My God , what &apos;s wrong with me ?
What am I doing ? Why would I do this ? &quot;
And I think back .
I think back to my father .
There was a time in my life where we had a very troubled experience in our family .
My brother , Henry , he died tragically when we were teenagers .
We lived in New York City , as I said .
We lived in the Bronx at the time , and the burial was in a place called Long Island , it was about two hours outside of the city .
And as we were preparing to come back from the burial , the cars stopped at the bathroom to let folks take care of themselves before the long ride back to the city .
And the limousine empties out .
My mother , my sister , my auntie , they all get out , but my father and I stayed in the limousine , and no sooner than the women got out , he burst out crying .
He didn &apos;t want cry in front of me , but he knew he wasn &apos;t going to make it back to the city , and it was better me than to allow himself to express these feelings and emotions in front of the women .
And this is a man who , 10 minutes ago , had just put his teenage son in the ground -- something I just can &apos;t even imagine .
The thing that sticks with me the most is that he was apologizing to me for crying in front of me , and at the same time , he was also giving me props , lifting me up , for not crying .
I come to also look at this as this fear that we have as men , this fear that just has us paralyzed , holding us hostage to this man box .
I can remember speaking to a 12-year-old boy , a football player , and I asked him , I said , &quot; How would you feel if , in front of all the players , your coach told you you were playing like a girl ? &quot;
Now I expected him to say something like , I &apos;d be sad ; I &apos;d be mad ; I &apos;d be angry , or something like that .
No , the boy said to me -- the boy said to me , &quot; It would destroy me . &quot;
And I said to myself , &quot; God , if it would destroy him to be called a girl , what are we then teaching him about girls ? &quot;
It took me back to a time when I was about 12 years old .
I grew up in tenement buildings in the inner city .
At this time we &apos;re living in the Bronx , and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny .
He was about 16 years old , and we were all about 12 years old -- younger guys .
And he was hanging out with all us younger guys .
And this guy , he was up to a lot of no good .
He was the kind of kid who parents would have to wonder , &quot; What is this 16-year-old boy doing with these 12-year-old boys ? &quot;
And he did spend a lot of time up to no good .
He was a troubled kid .
His mother had died from a heroin overdose .
He was being raised by his grandmother .
His father wasn &apos;t on the set .
His grandmother had two jobs .
He was home alone a lot .
But I &apos;ve got to tell you , we young guys , we looked up to this dude , man .
He was cool . He was fine .
That &apos;s what the sisters said , &quot; He was fine . &quot;
He was having sex .
We all looked up to him .
So one day , I &apos;m out in front of the house doing something -- just playing around , doing something -- I don &apos;t know what .
He looks out his window ; he calls me upstairs ; he said , &quot; Hey Anthony . &quot;
They called me Anthony growing up as a kid .
&quot; Hey Anthony , come on upstairs . &quot;
Johnny call , you go .
So I run right upstairs .
As he opens the door , he says to me , &quot; Do you want some ? &quot;
Now I immediately knew what he meant .
Because for me growing up at that time , and our relationship with this man box , &quot; Do you want some ? &quot; meant one of two things : sex or drugs -- and we weren &apos;t doing drugs .
Now my box , my card , my man box card , was immediately in jeopardy .
Two things : One , I never had sex .
We don &apos;t talk about that as men .
You only tell your dearest , closest friend , sworn to secrecy for life , the first time you had sex .
For everybody else , we go around like we &apos;ve been having sex since we were two .
There ain &apos;t no first time .
The other thing I couldn &apos;t tell him is that I didn &apos;t want any .
That &apos;s even worse . We &apos;re supposed to always be on the prowl .
Women are objects , especially sexual objects .
Anyway , so I couldn &apos;t tell him any of that .
So , like my mother would say , make a long story short , I just simply said to Johnny , &quot; Yes . &quot;
He told me to go in his room .
I go in his room . On his bed is a girl from the neighborhood named Sheila .
She &apos;s 16 years old .
She &apos;s nude .
She &apos;s what I know today to be mentally ill , higher-functioning at times than others .
We had a whole choice of inappropriate names for her .
Anyway , Johnny had just gotten through having sex with her .
Well actually , he raped her , but he would say he had sex with her .
Because , while Sheila never said no , she also never said yes .
So he was offering me the opportunity to do the same .
So when I go in the room , I close the door .
Folks , I &apos;m petrified .
I stand with my back to the door so Johnny can &apos;t bust in the room and see that I &apos;m not doing anything , and I stand there long enough that I could have actually done something .
So now I &apos;m no longer trying to figure out what I &apos;m going to do ; I &apos;m trying to figure out how I &apos;m going to get out of this room .
So in my 12 years of wisdom , I zip my pants down , I walk out into the room , and lo and behold to me , while I was in the room with Sheila , Johnny was back at the window calling guys up .
So now there &apos;s a living room full of guys .
It was like the waiting room in the doctor &apos;s office .
And they asked me how was it , and I say to them , &quot; It was good , &quot; and I zip my pants up in front of them , and I head for the door .
Now I say this all with remorse , and I was feeling a tremendous amount of remorse at that time , but I was conflicted , because , while I was feeling remorse , I was excited , because I didn &apos;t get caught .
But I knew I felt bad about what was happening .
This fear , getting outside the man box , totally enveloped me .
It was way more important to me , about me and my man box card than about Sheila and what was happening to her .
See collectively , we as men are taught to have less value in women , to view them as property and the objects of men .
We see that as an equation that equals violence against women .
We as men , good men , the large majority of men , we operate on the foundation of this whole collective socialization .
We kind of see ourselves separate , but we &apos;re very much a part of it .
You see , we have to come to understand that less value , property and objectification is the foundation and the violence can &apos;t happen without it .
So we &apos;re very much a part of the solution as well as the problem .
The center for disease control says that men &apos;s violence against women is at epidemic proportions , is the number one health concern for women in this country and abroad .
So quickly , I &apos;d like to just say , this is the love of my life , my daughter Jay .
The world I envision for her -- how do I want men to be acting and behaving ?
I need you on board . I need you with me .
I need you working with me and me working with you on how we raise our sons and teach them to be men -- that it &apos;s okay to not be dominating , that it &apos;s okay to have feelings and emotions , that it &apos;s okay to promote equality , that it &apos;s okay to have women who are just friends and that &apos;s it , that it &apos;s okay to be whole , that my liberation as a man is tied to your liberation as a woman .
I remember asking a nine-year-old boy , I asked a nine-year-old boy , &quot; What would life be like for you , if you didn &apos;t have to adhere to this man box ? &quot;
He said to me , &quot; I would be free . &quot;
Thank you folks .
Stanley McChrystal : Listen , learn ... then lead
Four-star general Stanley McChrystal shares what he learned about leadership over his decades in the military . How can you build a sense of shared purpose among people of many ages and skill sets ? By listening and learning -- and addressing the possibility of failure .
Ten years ago , on a Tuesday morning , I conducted a parachute jump at Fort Bragg , North Carolina .
It was a routine training jump , like many more I &apos;d done since I became a paratrooper 27 years before .
We went down to the airfield early because this is the Army and you always go early .
You do some routine refresher training , and then you go to put on your parachute and a buddy helps you .
And you put on the T-10 parachute .
And you &apos;re very careful how you put the straps , particularly the leg straps because they go between your legs .
And then you put on your reserve , and then you put on your heavy rucksack .
And then a jumpmaster comes , and he &apos;s an experienced NCO in parachute operations .
He checks you out , he grabs your adjusting straps and he tightens everything so that your chest is crushed , your shoulders are crushed down , and , of course , he &apos;s tightened so your voice goes up a couple octaves as well .
Then you sit down , and you wait a little while , because this is the Army .
Then you load the aircraft , and then you stand up and you get on , and you kind of lumber to the aircraft like this , in a line of people , and you sit down on canvas seats on either side of the aircraft .
And you wait a little bit longer , because this is the Air Force teaching the Army how to wait .
Then you take off .
And it &apos;s painful enough now -- and I think it &apos;s designed this way -- it &apos;s painful enough so you want to jump .
You didn &apos;t really want to jump , but you want out .
So you get in the aircraft , you &apos;re flying along , and at 20 minutes out , these jumpmasters start giving you commands .
They give 20 minutes -- that &apos;s a time warning .
You sit there , OK .
Then they give you 10 minutes .
And of course , you &apos;re responding with all of these .
And that &apos;s to boost everybody &apos;s confidence , to show that you &apos;re not scared .
Then they give you , &quot; Get ready . &quot;
Then they go , &quot; Outboard personnel , stand up . &quot;
If you &apos;re an outboard personnel , now you stand up .
If you &apos;re an inboard personnel , stand up .
And then you hook up , and you hook up your static line .
And at that point , you think , &quot; Hey , guess what ?
I &apos;m probably going to jump .
There &apos;s no way to get out of this at this point . &quot;
You go through some additional checks , and then they open the door .
And this was that Tuesday morning in September , and it was pretty nice outside .
So nice air comes flowing in .
The jumpmasters start to check the door .
And then when it &apos;s time to go , a green light goes and the jumpmaster goes , &quot; Go . &quot;
The first guy goes , and you &apos;re just in line , and you just kind of lumber to the door .
Jump is a misnomer ; you fall .
You fall outside the door , you &apos;re caught in the slipstream .
The first thing you do is lock into a tight body position -- head down in your chest , your arms extended , put over your reserve parachute .
You do that because , 27 years before , an airborne sergeant had taught me to do that .
I have no idea whether it makes any difference , but he seemed to make sense , and I wasn &apos;t going to test the hypothesis that he &apos;d be wrong .
And then you wait for the opening shock for your parachute to open .
If you don &apos;t get an opening shock , you don &apos;t get a parachute -- you &apos;ve got a whole new problem set .
But typically you do ; typically it opens .
And of course , if your leg straps aren &apos;t set right , at that point you get another little thrill .
Boom .
So then you look around , you &apos;re under a canopy and you say , &quot; This is good . &quot;
Now you prepare for the inevitable .
You are going to hit the ground .
You can &apos;t delay that much .
And you really can &apos;t decide where you hit very much , because they pretend you can steer , but you &apos;re being delivered .
So you look around , where you &apos;re going to land , you try to make yourself ready .
And then as you get close , you lower your rucksack below you on a lowering line , so that it &apos;s not on you when you land , and you prepare to do a parachute-landing fall .
Now the Army teaches you to do five points of performance -- the toes of your feet , your calves , your thighs , your buttocks and your push-up muscles .
It &apos;s this elegant little land , twist and roll .
And that &apos;s not going to hurt .
In 30-some years of jumping , I never did one .
I always landed like a watermelon out of a third floor window .
And as soon as I hit , the first thing I did is I &apos;d see if I &apos;d broken anything that I needed .
I &apos;d shake my head , and I &apos;d ask myself the eternal question : &quot; Why didn &apos;t I go into banking ? &quot;
And I &apos;d look around , and then I &apos;d see another paratrooper , a young guy or girl , and they &apos;d have pulled out their M4 carbine and they &apos;d be picking up their equipment .
They &apos;d be doing everything that we had taught them .
And I realized that , if they had to go into combat , they would do what we had taught them and they would follow leaders .
And I realized that , if they came out of combat , it would be because we led them well .
And I was hooked again on the importance of what I did .
So now I do that Tuesday morning jump , but it &apos;s not any jump -- that was September 11th , 2001 .
And when we took off from the airfield , America was at peace .
When we landed on the drop-zone , everything had changed .
And what we thought about the possibility of those young soldiers going into combat as being theoretical was now very , very real -- and leadership seemed important .
But things had changed ; I was a 46-year-old brigadier general .
I &apos;d been successful , but things changed so much that I was going to have to make some significant changes , and on that morning , I didn &apos;t know it .
I was raised with traditional stories of leadership : Robert E. Lee , John Buford at Gettysburg .
And I also was raised with personal examples of leadership .
This was my father in Vietnam .
And I was raised to believe that soldiers were strong and wise and brave and faithful ; they didn &apos;t lie , cheat , steal or abandon their comrades .
And I still believe real leaders are like that .
But in my first 25 years of career , I had a bunch of different experiences .
One of my first battalion commanders , I worked in his battalion for 18 months and the only conversation he ever had with Lt. McChrystal was at mile 18 of a 25-mile road march , and he chewed my ass for about 40 seconds .
And I &apos;m not sure that was real interaction .
But then a couple of years later , when I was a company commander , I went out to the National Training Center .
And we did an operation , and my company did a dawn attack -- you know , the classic dawn attack : you prepare all night , move to the line of departure .
And I had an armored organization at that point .
We move forward , and we get wiped out -- I mean , wiped out immediately .
The enemy didn &apos;t break a sweat doing it .
And after the battle , they bring this mobile theater and they do what they call an &quot; after action review &quot; to teach you what you &apos;ve done wrong .
Sort of leadership by humiliation .
They put a big screen up , and they take you through everything : &quot; and then you didn &apos;t do this , and you didn &apos;t do this , etc . &quot;
I walked out feeling as low as a snake &apos;s belly in a wagon rut .
And I saw my battalion commander , because I had let him down .
And I went up to apologize to him , and he said , &quot; Stanley , I thought you did great . &quot;
And in one sentence , he lifted me , put me back on my feet , and taught me that leaders can let you fail and yet not let you be a failure .
When 9 / 11 came , 46-year-old Brig. Gen. McChrystal sees a whole new world .
First , the things that are obvious , that you &apos;re familiar with : the environment changed -- the speed , the scrutiny , the sensitivity of everything now is so fast , sometimes it evolves faster than people have time to really reflect on it .
But everything we do is in a different context .
More importantly , the force that I led was spread over more than 20 countries .
And instead of being able to get all the key leaders for a decision together in a single room and look them in the eye and build their confidence and get trust from them , I &apos;m now leading a force that &apos;s dispersed , and I &apos;ve got to use other techniques .
I &apos;ve got to use video teleconferences , I &apos;ve got to use chat , I &apos;ve got to use everything I can , not just for communication , but for leadership .
A 22-year-old individual operating alone , thousands of miles from me , has got to communicate to me with confidence .
I have to have trust in them and vice versa .
And I also have to build their faith .
And that &apos;s a new kind of leadership for me .
We had one operation where we had to coordinate it from multiple locations .
An emerging opportunity came -- didn &apos;t have time to get everybody together .
So we had to get complex intelligence together , we had to line up the ability to act .
It was sensitive , we had to go up the chain of command , convince them that this was the right thing to do and do all of this on electronic medium .
We failed .
The mission didn &apos;t work .
And so now what we had to do is I had to reach out to try to rebuild the trust of that force , rebuild their confidence -- me and them , and them and me , and our seniors and us as a force -- all without the ability to put a hand on a shoulder .
Entirely new requirement .
Also , the people had changed .
You probably think that the force that I led was all steely-eyed commandos with big knuckle fists carrying exotic weapons .
In reality , much of the force I led looked exactly like you .
It was men , women , young , old -- not just from military ; from different organizations , many of them detailed to us just from a handshake .
And so instead of giving orders , you &apos;re now building consensus and you &apos;re building a sense of shared purpose .
Probably the biggest change was understanding that the generational difference , the ages , had changed so much .
I went down to be with a Ranger platoon on an operation in Afghanistan , and on that operation , a sergeant in the platoon had lost about half his arm throwing a Taliban hand grenade back at the enemy after it had landed in his fire team .
We talked about the operation , and then at the end I did what I often do with a force like that .
I asked , &quot; Where were you on 9 / 11 ? &quot;
And one young Ranger in the back -- his hair &apos;s tousled and his face is red and windblown from being in combat in the cold Afghan wind -- he said , &quot; Sir , I was in the sixth grade . &quot;
And it reminded me that we &apos;re operating a force that must have shared purpose and shared consciousness , and yet he has different experiences , in many cases a different vocabulary , a completely different skill set in terms of digital media than I do and many of the other senior leaders .
And yet , we need to have that shared sense .
It also produced something which I call an inversion of expertise , because we had so many changes at the lower levels in technology and tactics and whatnot , that suddenly the things that we grew up doing wasn &apos;t what the force was doing anymore .
So how does a leader stay credible and legitimate when they haven &apos;t done what the people you &apos;re leading are doing ?
And it &apos;s a brand new leadership challenge .
And it forced me to become a lot more transparent , a lot more willing to listen , a lot more willing to be reverse-mentored from lower .
And yet , again , you &apos;re not all in one room .
Then another thing .
There &apos;s an effect on you and on your leaders .
There &apos;s an impact , it &apos;s cumulative .
You don &apos;t reset , or recharge your battery every time .
I stood in front of a screen one night in Iraq with one of my senior officers and we watched a firefight from one of our forces .
And I remembered his son was in our force .
And I said , &quot; John , where &apos;s your son ? And how is he ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Sir , he &apos;s fine . Thanks for asking . &quot;
I said , &quot; Where is he now ? &quot;
And he pointed at the screen , he said , &quot; He &apos;s in that firefight . &quot;
Think about watching your brother , father , daughter , son , wife in a firefight in real time and you can &apos;t do anything about it .
Think about knowing that over time .
And it &apos;s a new cumulative pressure on leaders .
And you have to watch and take care of each other .
I probably learned the most about relationships .
I learned they are the sinew which hold the force together .
I grew up much of my career in the Ranger regiment .
And every morning in the Ranger regiment , every Ranger -- and there are more than 2,000 of them -- says a six-stanza Ranger creed .
You may know one line of it , it says , &quot; I &apos;ll never leave a fallen comrade to fall into the hands of the enemy . &quot;
And it &apos;s not a mindless mantra , and it &apos;s not a poem .
It &apos;s a promise .
Every Ranger promises every other Ranger , &quot; No matter what happens , no matter what it costs me , if you need me , I &apos;m coming . &quot;
And every Ranger gets that same promise from every other Ranger .
Think about it . It &apos;s extraordinarily powerful .
It &apos;s probably more powerful than marriage vows .
And they &apos;ve lived up to it , which gives it special power .
And so the organizational relationship that bonds them is just amazing .
And I learned personal relationships were more important than ever .
We were in a difficult operation in Afghanistan in 2007 , and an old friend of mine , that I had spent many years at various points of my career with -- godfather to one of their kids -- he sent me a note , just in an envelope , that had a quote from Sherman to Grant that said , &quot; I knew if I ever got in a tight spot , that you would come , if alive . &quot;
And having that kind of relationship , for me , turned out to be critical at many points in my career .
And I learned that you have to give that in this environment , because it &apos;s tough .
That was my journey .
I hope it &apos;s not over .
I came to believe that a leader isn &apos;t good because they &apos;re right ; they &apos;re good because they &apos;re willing to learn and to trust .
This isn &apos;t easy stuff .
It &apos;s not like that electronic abs machine where , 15 minutes a month , you get washboard abs .
And it isn &apos;t always fair .
You can get knocked down , and it hurts and it leaves scars .
But if you &apos;re a leader , the people you &apos;ve counted on will help you up .
And if you &apos;re a leader , the people who count on you need you on your feet .
Thank you .
Arunachalam Muruganantham : How I started a sanitary napkin revolution !
When he realized his wife had to choose between buying family meals and buying her monthly &quot; supplies , &quot; Arunachalam Muruganantham vowed to help her solve the problem of the sanitary pad . His research got very very personal -- and led him to a powerful business model .
So I tried to do a small good thing for my wife .
It makes me to stand here , the fame , the money I got out of it .
So what I did , I &apos;d gone back to my early marriage days .
What you did in the early marriage days , you tried to impress your wife . I did the same .
On that occasion , I found my wife carrying something like this .
I saw . &quot; What is that ? &quot; I asked .
My wife replied , &quot; None of your business . &quot;
Then , being her husband , I ran behind her and saw she had a nasty rag cloth .
I don &apos;t even use that cloth to clean my two-wheeler .
Then I understood this -- adapting that unhygienic method to manage her period days .
Then I immediately asked her , why are you &#91; using &#93; that unhygienic method ?
She replied , I also know about &#91; sanitary pads &#93; , but myself and my sisters , if they start using that , we have to cut our family milk budget .
Then I was shocked . What is the connection between using a sanitary pad and a milk budget ?
And it &apos;s called affordability .
I tried to impress my new wife by offering her a packet of sanitary pads .
I went to a local shop , I tried to buy her a sanitary pad packet .
That fellow looks left and right , and spreads a newspaper , rolls it into the newspaper , gives it to me like a banned item , something like that .
I don &apos;t know why . I did not ask for a condom .
Then I took that pad . I want to see that . What is inside it ?
The very first time , at the age of 29 , that day I am touching the sanitary pad , first ever .
I must know : How many of the guys here have touched a sanitary pad ?
They are not going to touch that , because it &apos;s not your matter .
Then I thought to myself , white substance , made of cotton -- oh my God , that guy is just using a penny value of raw material -- inside they are selling for pounds , dollars .
Why not make a local sanitary pad for my new wife ?
That &apos;s how all this started , but after making a sanitary pad , where can I check it ?
It &apos;s not like I can just check it in the lab .
I need a woman volunteer . Where can I get one in India ?
Even in Bangalore you won &apos;t get &#91; one &#93; , in India .
So only problem : the only available victim is my wife .
Then I made a sanitary pad and handed it to Shanti -- my wife &apos;s name is Shanti .
&quot; Close your eyes . Whatever I give , it will be not a diamond pendant not a diamond ring , even a chocolate , I will give you a surprise with a lot of tinsel paper rolled up with it .
Close your eyes . &quot;
Because I tried to make it intimate .
Because it &apos;s an arranged marriage , not a love marriage .
So one day she said , openly , I &apos;m not going to support this research .
Then other victims , they got into my sisters .
But even sisters , wives , they &apos;re not ready to support in the research .
That &apos;s why I am always jealous with the saints in India .
They are having a lot of women volunteers around them .
Why I am not getting &#91; any &#93; ?
You know , without them even calling , they &apos;ll get a lot of women volunteers .
Then I used , tried to use the medical college girls .
They also refused . Finally , I decide , use sanitary pad myself .
Now I am having a title like the first man to set foot on the moon .
Armstrong . Then Tenzing &#91; and &#93; Hillary , in Everest , like that Muruganantham is the first man wore a sanitary pad across the globe .
I wore a sanitary pad . I filled animal blood in a football bottle , I tied it up here , there is a tube going into my panties , while I &apos;m walking , while I &apos;m cycling , I made a press , doses of blood will go there .
That makes me bow down to any woman in front of me to give full respect . That five days I &apos;ll never forget -- the messy days , the lousy days , that wetness .
My God , it &apos;s unbelievable .
But here the problem is , one company is making napkin out of cotton . It is working well .
But I am also trying to make sanitary pad with the good cotton . It &apos;s not working .
That makes me to want to refuse to continue this research and research and research .
You need first funds .
Not only financial crises , but because of the sanitary pad research , I come through all sorts of problems , including a divorce notice from my wife .
Why is this ? I used medical college girls .
She suspects I am using as a trump card to run behind medical college girls .
Finally , I came to know it is a special cellulose derived from a pinewood , but even after that , you need a multimillion-dollar plant like this to process that material . Again , a stop-up .
Then I spend another four years to create my own machine tools , a simple machine tool like this .
In this machine , any rural woman can apply the same raw materials that they are processing in the multinational plant , anyone can make a world-class napkin at your dining hall .
That is my invention .
So after that , what I did , usually if anyone got a patent or an invention , immediately you want to make , convert into this .
I never did this . I dropped it just like this , because you do this , if anyone runs after money , their life will not &#91; have &#93; any beauty . It is boredom .
A lot of people making a lot of money , billion , billions of dollars accumulating .
Why are they coming for , finally , for philanthropy ?
Why the need for accumulating money , then doing philanthropy ?
What if one decided to start philanthropy from the day one ?
That &apos;s why I am giving this machine only in rural India , for rural women , because in India , &#91; you &apos;ll be &#93; surprised , only two percent of women are using sanitary pads . The rest , they &apos;re using a rag cloth , a leaf , husk , &#91; saw &#93; dust , everything except sanitary pads .
It is the same in the 21st century . That &apos;s why I am going to decide to give this machine only for poor women across India .
So far , 630 installations happened in 23 states in six other countries .
Now I &apos;m on my seventh year sustaining against multinational , transnational giants -- makes all MBA students a question mark .
A school dropout from Coimbatore , how he is able to sustaining ?
That makes me a visiting professor and guest lecturer in all IIMs .
Play video one .
Arunachalam Muruganantham : The thing I saw in my wife &apos;s hand , &quot; Why are you using that nasty cloth ? &quot;
She replied immediately , &quot; I know about napkins , but if I start using napkins , then we have to cut our family milk budget . &quot;
Why not make myself a low-cost napkin ?
So I decided I &apos;m going to sell this new machine only for Women Self Help Groups .
That is my idea .
AM : And previously , you need a multimillion investment for machine and all . Now , any rural woman can .
They are performing puja .
: You just think , competing giants , even from Harvard , Oxford , is difficult .
I make a rural woman to compete with multinationals .
I &apos;m sustaining on seventh year .
Already 600 installations . What is my mission ?
I &apos;m going to make India &#91; into &#93; a 100-percent-sanitary-napkin-using country in my lifetime .
In this way I &apos;m going to provide not less than a million rural employment that I &apos;m going to create .
That &apos;s why I &apos;m not running after this bloody money .
I &apos;m doing something serious .
If you chase a girl , the girl won &apos;t like you .
Do your job simply , the girl will chase you .
Like that , I never chased Mahalakshmi .
Mahalakshmi is chasing me , I am keeping in the back pocket .
Not in front pocket . I &apos;m a back pocket man .
That &apos;s all . A school dropout saw your problem in the society of not using sanitary pad .
I am becoming a solution provider . I &apos;m very happy .
I don &apos;t want to make this as a corporate entity .
I want to make this as a local sanitary pad movement across the globe . That &apos;s why I put all the details on public domain like an open software .
Now 110 countries are accessing it . Okay ?
So I classify the people into three : uneducated , little educated , surplus educated .
Little educated , done this . Surplus educated , what are you going to do for the society ?
Thank you very much . Bye !
Stephen Hawking : Questioning the universe
In keeping with the theme of TED2008 , professor Stephen Hawking asks some Big Questions about our universe -- How did the universe begin ? How did life begin ? Are we alone ? -- and discusses how we might go about answering them .
There is nothing bigger or older than the universe .
The questions I would like to talk about are : one , where did we come from ?
How did the universe come into being ?
Are we alone in the universe ?
Is there alien life out there ?
What is the future of the human race ?
Up until the 1920s , everyone thought the universe was essentially static and unchanging in time .
Then it was discovered that the universe was expanding .
Distant galaxies were moving away from us .
This meant they must have been closer together in the past .
If we extrapolate back , we find we must have all been on top of each other about 15 billion years ago .
This was the Big Bang , the beginning of the universe .
But was there anything before the Big Bang ?
If not , what created the universe ?
Why did the universe emerge from the Big Bang the way it did ?
We used to think that the theory of the universe could be divided into two parts .
First , there were the laws like Maxwell &apos;s equations and general relativity that determined the evolution of the universe , given its state over all of space at one time .
And second , there was no question of the initial state of the universe .
We have made good progress on the first part , and now have the knowledge of the laws of evolution in all but the most extreme conditions .
But until recently , we have had little idea about the initial conditions for the universe .
However , this division into laws of evolution and initial conditions depends on time and space being separate and distinct .
Under extreme conditions , general relativity and quantum theory allow time to behave like another dimension of space .
This removes the distinction between time and space , and means the laws of evolution can also determine the initial state .
The universe can spontaneously create itself out of nothing .
Moreover , we can calculate a probability that the universe was created in different states .
These predictions are in excellent agreement with observations by the WMAP satellite of the cosmic microwave background , which is an imprint of the very early universe .
We think we have solved the mystery of creation .
Maybe we should patent the universe and charge everyone royalties for their existence .
I now turn to the second big question : are we alone , or is there other life in the universe ?
We believe that life arose spontaneously on the Earth , so it must be possible for life to appear on other suitable planets , of which there seem to be a large number in the galaxy .
But we don &apos;t know how life first appeared .
We have two pieces of observational evidence on the probability of life appearing .
The first is that we have fossils of algae from 3.5 billion years ago .
The Earth was formed 4.6 billion years ago and was probably too hot for about the first half billion years .
So life appeared on Earth within half a billion years of it being possible , which is short compared to the 10-billion-year lifetime of a planet of Earth type .
This suggests that a probability of life appearing is reasonably high .
If it was very low , one would have expected it to take most of the ten billion years available .
On the other hand , we don &apos;t seem to have been visited by aliens .
I am discounting the reports of UFOs .
Why would they appear only to cranks and weirdoes ?
If there is a government conspiracy to suppress the reports and keep for itself the scientific knowledge the aliens bring , it seems to have been a singularly ineffective policy so far .
Furthermore , despite an extensive search by the SETI project , we haven &apos;t heard any alien television quiz shows .
This probably indicates that there are no alien civilizations at our stage of development within a radius of a few hundred light years .
Issuing an insurance policy against abduction by aliens seems a pretty safe bet .
This brings me to the last of the big questions : the future of the human race .
If we are the only intelligent beings in the galaxy , we should make sure we survive and continue .
But we are entering an increasingly dangerous period of our history .
Our population and our use of the finite resources of planet Earth are growing exponentially , along with our technical ability to change the environment for good or ill .
But our genetic code still carries the selfish and aggressive instincts that were of survival advantage in the past .
It will be difficult enough to avoid disaster in the next hundred years , let alone the next thousand or million .
Our only chance of long-term survival is not to remain lurking on planet Earth , but to spread out into space .
The answers to these big questions show that we have made remarkable progress in the last hundred years .
But if we want to continue beyond the next hundred years , our future is in space .
That is why I am in favor of manned -- or should I say , personed -- space flight .
All of my life I have sought to understand the universe and find answers to these questions .
I have been very lucky that my disability has not been a serious handicap .
Indeed , it has probably given me more time than most people to pursue the quest for knowledge .
The ultimate goal is a complete theory of the universe , and we are making good progress .
Thank you for listening .
Professor , if you had to guess either way , do you now believe that it is more likely than not that we are alone in the Milky Way , as a civilization of our level of intelligence or higher ?
This answer took seven minutes , and really gave me an insight into the incredible act of generosity this whole talk was for TED .
Stephen Hawking : I think it quite likely that we are the only civilization within several hundred light years ; otherwise we would have heard radio waves .
The alternative is that civilizations don &apos;t last very long , but destroy themselves .
Professor Hawking , thank you for that answer .
We will take it as a salutary warning , I think , for the rest of our conference this week .
Professor , we really thank you for the extraordinary effort you made to share your questions with us today .
Thank you very much indeed .
Amanda Bennett : We need a heroic narrative for death
Amanda Bennett and her husband were passionate and full of life all throughout their lives together -- and up until the final days , too . Bennett gives a sweet yet powerful talk on why , for the loved ones of the dying , having hope for a happy ending shouldn &apos;t warrant a diagnosis of &quot; denial . &quot; She calls for a more heroic narrative for death -- to match the ones we have in life .
So I &apos;d like you to come back with me just for a few minutes to a dark night in China , the night I met my husband .
It was a city so long ago that it was still called Peking .
So I went to a party .
I sat down next to a stout , middle-aged man with owl glasses and a bow tie , and he turned out to be a Fulbright scholar , there in China specifically to study Sino-Soviet relations .
What a gift it was to the eager , young foreign correspondent that I was then .
I &apos;d pump him for information , I &apos;m mentally scribbling notes for the stories I plan to write .
I talk to him for hours .
Only months later , I discover who he really was .
He was the China representative for the American Soybean Association .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand . Soybeans ?
You told me you were a Fulbright scholar . &quot;
&quot; Well , how long would you have talked to me if I told you we &apos;re in soybeans ? &quot;
I said , &quot; You jerk . &quot;
Only jerk wasn &apos;t the word I used .
I said , &quot; You could &apos;ve gotten me fired . &quot;
And he said , &quot; Let &apos;s get married . &quot;
&quot; Travel the world and have lots of kids . &quot;
So we did .
And what an alive man Terence Bryan Foley turned out to be .
He was a Chinese scholar who later , in his 60s , got a Ph.D. in Chinese history .
He spoke six languages , he played 15 musical instruments , he was a licensed pilot , he had once been a San Francisco cable car operator , he was an expert in swine nutrition , dairy cattle , Dixieland jazz , film noir , and we did travel the country , and the world , and we did have a lot of kids .
We followed my job , and it seemed like there was nothing that we couldn &apos;t do .
So when we found the cancer , it doesn &apos;t seem strange to us at all that without saying a word to each other , we believed that , if we were smart enough and strong enough and brave enough , and we worked hard enough , we could keep him from dying ever .
And for years , it seemed like we were succeeding .
The surgeon emerged from the surgery .
What &apos;d he say ? He said what surgeons always say : &quot; We got it all . &quot;
Then there was a setback when the pathologists looked at the kidney cancer closely .
It turned out to be a rare , exceedingly aggressive type , with a diagnosis that was almost universally fatal in several weeks at most .
And yet , he did not die .
Mysteriously , he lived on .
He coached Little League for our son .
He built a playhouse for our daughter .
And meanwhile , I &apos;m burying myself in the Internet looking for specialists .
I &apos;m looking for a cure .
So a year goes by before the cancer , as cancers do , reappears , and with it comes another death sentence , this time nine months .
So we try another treatment , aggressive , nasty .
It makes him so sick , he has to quit it , yet still he lives on .
Then another year goes by .
Two years go by .
More specialists .
We take the kids to Italy .
We take the kids to Australia .
And then more years pass , and the cancer begins to grow .
This time , there &apos;s new treatments on the horizon .
They &apos;re exotic . They &apos;re experimental .
They &apos;re going to attack the cancer in new ways .
So he enters a clinical trial , and it works .
The cancer begins to shrink , and for the third time , we &apos;ve dodged death .
So now I ask you , how do I feel when the time finally comes and there &apos;s another dark night , sometime between midnight and 2 a.m. ?
This time it &apos;s on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I &apos;ve never met before tells me that Terence is dying , perhaps tonight .
So what do I say when he says , &quot; What do you want me to do ? &quot;
There &apos;s another drug out there .
It &apos;s newer . It &apos;s more powerful .
He started it just two weeks ago .
Perhaps there &apos;s still hope ahead .
So what do I say ?
I say , &quot; Keep him alive if you can . &quot;
And Terence died six days later .
So we fought , we struggled , we triumphed .
It was an exhilarating fight , and I &apos;d repeat the fight today without a moment &apos;s hesitation .
We fought together , we lived together .
It turned what could have been seven of the grimmest years of our life into seven of the most glorious .
It was also an expensive fight .
It was the kind of fight and the kind of choices that everyone here agrees pump up the cost of end-of-life care , and of healthcare for all of us .
And for me , for us , we pushed the fight right over the edge , and I never got the chance to say to him what I say to him now almost every day : &quot; Hey , buddy , it was a hell of a ride . &quot;
We never got the chance to say goodbye .
We never thought it was the end .
We always had hope .
So what do we make of all of this ?
Being a journalist , after Terence died , I wrote a book , &quot; The Cost Of Hope . &quot;
I wrote it because I wanted to know why I did what I did , why he did what he did , why everyone around us did what they did .
And what did I discover ?
Well , one of the things I discovered is that experts think that one answer to what I did at the end was a piece of paper , the advance directive , to help families get past the seemingly irrational choices .
Yet I had that piece of paper .
We both did .
And they were readily available .
I had them right at hand .
Both of them said the same thing : Do nothing if there is no further hope .
I knew Terence &apos;s wishes as clearly and as surely as I knew my own .
Yet we never got to no further hope .
Even with that clear-cut paper in our hands , we just kept redefining hope .
I believed I could keep him from dying , and I &apos;d be embarrassed to say that if I hadn &apos;t seen so many people and have talked to so many people who have felt exactly the same way .
Right up until days before his death , I felt strongly and powerfully , and , you might say , irrationally , that I could keep him from dying ever .
Now , what do the experts call this ?
They say it &apos;s denial .
It &apos;s a strong word , isn &apos;t it ?
Yet I will tell you that denial isn &apos;t even close to a strong enough word to describe what those of us facing the death of our loved ones go through .
And I hear the medical professionals say , &quot; Well , we &apos;d like to do such-and-such , but the family &apos;s in denial .
The family won &apos;t listen to reason .
They &apos;re in denial .
How can they insist on this treatment at the end ?
It &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot;
Now , I think this maybe isn &apos;t a very useful way of thinking .
It &apos;s not just families either .
The medical professionals too , you out there , you &apos;re in denial too .
You want to help . You want to fix .
You want to do .
You &apos;ve succeeded in everything you &apos;ve done , and having a patient die , well , that must feel like failure .
I saw it firsthand .
Just days before Terence died , his oncologist said , &quot; Tell Terence that better days are just ahead . &quot;
Days before he died .
Yet Ira Byock , the director of palliative medicine at Dartmouth said , &quot; You know , the best doctor in the world has never succeeded in making anyone immortal . &quot;
So what the experts call &quot; denial , &quot; I call &quot; hope , &quot; and I &apos;d like to borrow a phrase from my friends in software design .
You just redefine denial and hope , and it becomes a feature of being human .
It &apos;s not a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
So we need to think more constructively about this very common , very profound and very powerful human emotion .
It &apos;s part of the human condition , and yet our system and our thinking isn &apos;t built to accommodate it .
So Terence told me a story on that long-ago night , and I believed it .
Maybe I wanted to believe it .
And during Terence &apos;s illness , I , we , we wanted to believe the story of our fight together too .
Giving up the fight -- for that &apos;s how it felt , it felt like giving up -- meant giving up not only his life but also our story , our story of us as fighters , the story of us as invincible , and for the doctors , the story of themselves as healers .
So what do we need ?
Maybe we don &apos;t need a new piece of paper .
Maybe we need a new story , not a story about giving up the fight or of hopelessness , but rather a story of victory and triumph , of a valiant battle and , eventually , a graceful retreat , a story that acknowledges that not even the greatest general defeats every foe , that no doctor has ever succeeded in making anyone immortal , and that no wife , no matter how hard she tried , has ever stopped even the bravest , wittiest and most maddeningly lovable husband from dying when it was his time to go .
People did mention hospice , but I wouldn &apos;t listen .
Hospice was for people who were dying , and Terence wasn &apos;t dying .
As a result , he spent just four days in hospice , which I &apos;m sure , as you all know , is a pretty typical outcome , and we never said goodbye because we were unprepared for the end .
We have a noble path to curing the disease , patients and doctors alike , but there doesn &apos;t seem to be a noble path to dying .
Dying is seen as failing , and we had a heroic narrative for fighting together , but we didn &apos;t have a heroic narrative for letting go .
So maybe we need a narrative for acknowledging the end , and for saying goodbye , and maybe our new story will be about a hero &apos;s fight , and a hero &apos;s goodbye .
Terence loved poetry , and the Greek poet Constantine Cavafy is one of my favorite poets .
So I &apos;ll give you a couple lines from him .
This is a poem about Mark Antony .
You know Mark Antony , the conquering hero , Cleopatra &apos;s guy ?
Actually , one of Cleopatra &apos;s guys .
And he &apos;s been a pretty good general .
He &apos;s won all the fights , he &apos;s eluded all the people that are out to get him , and yet this time , finally , he &apos;s come to the city of Alexandria and realized he &apos;s lost .
The people are leaving . They &apos;re playing instruments .
They &apos;re singing .
And suddenly he knows he &apos;s been defeated .
And he suddenly knows he &apos;s been deserted by the gods , and it &apos;s time to let go .
And the poet tells him what to do .
He tells him how to say a noble goodbye , a goodbye that &apos;s fit for a hero .
&quot; As if long-prepared , as if courageous , as it becomes you who were worthy of such a city , approach the window with a firm step , and with emotion , but not with the entreaties or the complaints of a coward , as a last enjoyment , listen to the sounds , the exquisite instruments of the musical troops , and bid her farewell , the Alexandria you are losing . &quot;
That &apos;s a goodbye for a man who was larger than life , a goodbye for a man for whom anything , well , almost anything , was possible , a goodbye for a man who kept hope alive .
And isn &apos;t that what we &apos;re missing ?
How can we learn that people &apos;s decisions about their loved ones are often based strongly , powerfully , many times irrationally , on the slimmest of hopes ?
The overwhelming presence of hope isn &apos;t denial .
It &apos;s part of our DNA as humans , and maybe it &apos;s time our healthcare system -- doctors , patients , insurance companies , us , started accounting for the power of that hope .
Hope isn &apos;t a bug .
It &apos;s a feature .
Thank you .
Juliana Machado Ferreira : The fight to end rare-animal trafficking in Brazil
Biologist Juliana Machado Ferreira , a TED Senior Fellow , talks about her work helping to save birds and other animals stolen from the wild in Brazil . Once these animals are seized from smugglers , she asks , then what ?
Illegal wildlife trade in Brazil is one of the major threats against our fauna , especially birds , and mainly to supply the pet market with thousands of animals taken from nature every month , and transported far from their origins , to be sold mainly in Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo .
It is estimated that all kinds of illegal wildlife trade in Brazil withdraw from nature almost 38 million animals every year , a business worth almost two billion dollars .
The police intercepts these huge cargos with live animals , intended to supply the pet market , or they seize the animals directly from the people &apos;s houses , and this is how we end up , every month , with thousands of seized animals .
And for us to understand what happens with them , we &apos;re going to follow Brad .
In the eyes of many people , after the animals are seized , they say , &quot; Yay , justice has been served .
The good guys arrived , took the cute , mistreated animals from the hands of the evil traffickers , and everyone lived happily ever after . &quot;
But did they ? Actually , no , and this is where many of our problems begin .
Because we have to figure out what to do with all these animals .
In Brazil , they are usually first sent to governmental triage facilities , in which most of the cases , the conditions are as bad as with the traffickers .
In 2002 , these centers received 45,000 animals , of which 37,000 were birds .
And the police estimates that we seize only five percent of what &apos;s being trafficked .
Some lucky ones -- and among them , Brad -- go to serious rehabilitation centers after that .
And in these places they are cared for .
They train their flying , they learn how to recognize the food they will find in nature , and they are able to socialize with others from the same species .
But then what ?
The Brazil Ornithological Society -- so now we &apos;re talking only birds -- claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature .
Therefore , it would be too risky to release these animals , both for the released and for the natural populations .
They also claim that we spend too many resources in their rehabilitation .
Following this argument , they suggest that all the birds seized from non-threatened species should be euthanized .
However , this would mean having killed 26,267 birds , only in the state of S√£o Paulo , only in 2006 .
But , some researchers , myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative .
We think that if and when the animals meet certain criteria concerning their health , behavior , inferred origin and whatever we know about the natural populations , then technically responsible releases are possible , both for the well-being of the individual , and for the conservation of the species and their ecosystems , because we will be returning genes for these populations -- which could be important for them in facing environmental challenges -- and also we could be returning potential seed dispersers , predators , preys , etc .
All of these were released by us .
On the top , the turtles are just enjoying freedom .
On the middle , this guy nested a couple of weeks after the release .
And on the bottom , my personal favorite , the little male over there , four hours after his release he was together with a wild female .
So , this is not new , people have been doing this around the world .
But it &apos;s still a big issue in Brazil .
We believe we have performed responsible releases .
We &apos;ve registered released animals mating in nature and having chicks .
So , these genes are indeed going back to the populations .
However this is still a minority for the very lack of knowledge .
So , I say , &quot; Let &apos;s study more , let &apos;s shed light on this issue , let &apos;s do whatever we can . &quot;
I &apos;m devoting my career to that .
And I &apos;m here to urge each and every one of you to do whatever is in your reach : Talk to your neighbor , teach your children , make sure your pet is from a legal breeder .
We need to act , and act now , before these ones are the only ones left .
Thank you very much .
Shawn Achor : The happy secret to better work
We believe that we should work to be happy , but could that be backwards ? In this fast-moving and entertaining talk , psychologist Shawn Achor argues that actually happiness inspires productivity . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
When I was seven years old and my sister was just five years old , we were playing on top of a bunk bed .
I was two years older than my sister at the time -- I mean , I &apos;m two years older than her now -- but at the time it meant she had to do everything that I wanted to do , and I wanted to play war .
So we were up on top of our bunk beds .
And on one side of the bunk bed , I had put out all of my G.I. Joe soldiers and weaponry .
And on the other side were all my sister &apos;s My Little Ponies ready for a cavalry charge .
There are differing accounts of what actually happened that afternoon , but since my sister is not here with us today , let me tell you the true story -- -- which is my sister &apos;s a little bit on the clumsy side .
Somehow , without any help or push from her older brother at all , suddenly Amy disappeared off of the top of the bunk bed and landed with this crash on the floor .
Now I nervously peered over the side of the bed to see what had befallen my fallen sister and saw that she had landed painfully on her hands and knees on all fours on the ground .
I was nervous because my parents had charged me with making sure that my sister and I played as safely and as quietly as possible .
And seeing as how I had accidentally broken Amy &apos;s arm just one week before ...
... heroically pushing her out of the way of an oncoming imaginary sniper bullet , for which I have yet to be thanked , I was trying as hard as I could -- she didn &apos;t even see it coming -- I was trying as hard as I could to be on my best behavior .
And I saw my sister &apos;s face , this wail of pain and suffering and surprise threatening to erupt from her mouth and threatening to wake my parents from the long winter &apos;s nap for which they had settled .
So I did the only thing my little frantic seven year-old brain could think to do to avert this tragedy .
And if you have children , you &apos;ve seen this hundreds of times before .
I said , &quot; Amy , Amy , wait . Don &apos;t cry . Don &apos;t cry .
Did you see how you landed ?
No human lands on all fours like that .
Amy , I think this means you &apos;re a unicorn . &quot;
Now that was cheating , because there was nothing in the world my sister would want more than not to be Amy the hurt five year-old little sister , but Amy the special unicorn .
Of course , this was an option that was open to her brain at no point in the past .
And you could see how my poor , manipulated sister faced conflict , as her little brain attempted to devote resources to feeling the pain and suffering and surprise she just experienced , or contemplating her new-found identity as a unicorn .
And the latter won out .
Instead of crying , instead of ceasing our play , instead of waking my parents , with all the negative consequences that would have ensued for me , instead a smile spread across her face and she scrambled right back up onto the bunk bed with all the grace of a baby unicorn ...
... with one broken leg .
What we stumbled across at this tender age of just five and seven -- we had no idea at the time -- was something that was going be at the vanguard of a scientific revolution occurring two decades later in the way that we look at the human brain .
What we had stumbled across is something called positive psychology , which is the reason that I &apos;m here today and the reason that I wake up every morning .
When I first started talking about this research outside of academia , out with companies and schools , the very first thing they said to never do is to start your talk with a graph .
The very first thing I want to do is start my talk with a graph .
This graph looks boring , but this graph is the reason I get excited and wake up every morning .
And this graph doesn &apos;t even mean anything ; it &apos;s fake data .
What we found is -- If I got this data back studying you here in the room , I would be thrilled , because there &apos;s very clearly a trend that &apos;s going on there , and that means that I can get published , which is all that really matters .
The fact that there &apos;s one weird red dot that &apos;s up above the curve , there &apos;s one weirdo in the room -- I know who you are , I saw you earlier -- that &apos;s no problem .
That &apos;s no problem , as most of you know , because I can just delete that dot .
I can delete that dot because that &apos;s clearly a measurement error .
And we know that &apos;s a measurement error because it &apos;s messing up my data .
So one of the very first things we teach people in economics and statistics and business and psychology courses is how , in a statistically valid way , do we eliminate the weirdos .
How do we eliminate the outliers so we can find the line of best fit ?
Which is fantastic if I &apos;m trying to find out how many Advil the average person should be taking -- two .
But if I &apos;m interested in potential , if I &apos;m interested in your potential , or for happiness or productivity or energy or creativity , what we &apos;re doing is we &apos;re creating the cult of the average with science .
If I asked a question like , &quot; How fast can a child learn how to read in a classroom ? &quot;
scientists change the answer to &quot; How fast does the average child learn how to read in that classroom ? &quot;
and then we tailor the class right towards the average .
Now if you fall below the average on this curve , then psychologists get thrilled , because that means you &apos;re either depressed or you have a disorder , or hopefully both .
We &apos;re hoping for both because our business model is , if you come into a therapy session with one problem , we want to make sure you leave knowing you have 10 , so you keep coming back over and over again .
We &apos;ll go back into your childhood if necessary , but eventually what we want to do is make you normal again .
But normal is merely average .
And what I posit and what positive psychology posits is that if we study what is merely average , we will remain merely average .
Then instead of deleting those positive outliers , what I intentionally do is come into a population like this one and say , why ?
Why is it that some of you are so high above the curve in terms of your intellectual ability , athletic ability , musical ability , creativity , energy levels , your resiliency in the face of challenge , your sense of humor ?
Whatever it is , instead of deleting you , what I want to do is study you .
Because maybe we can glean information -- not just how to move people up to the average , but how we can move the entire average up in our companies and schools worldwide .
The reason this graph is important to me is , when I turn on the news , it seems like the majority of the information is not positive , in fact it &apos;s negative .
Most of it &apos;s about murder , corruption , diseases , natural disasters .
And very quickly , my brain starts to think that &apos;s the accurate ratio of negative to positive in the world .
What that &apos;s doing is creating something called the medical school syndrome -- which , if you know people who &apos;ve been to medical school , during the first year of medical training , as you read through a list of all the symptoms and diseases that could happen , suddenly you realize you have all of them .
I have a brother in-law named Bobo -- which is a whole other story .
Bobo married Amy the unicorn .
Bobo called me on the phone from Yale Medical School , and Bobo said , &quot; Shawn , I have leprosy . &quot;
Which , even at Yale , is extraordinarily rare .
But I had no idea how to console poor Bobo because he had just gotten over an entire week of menopause .
See what we &apos;re finding is it &apos;s not necessarily the reality that shapes us , but the lens through which your brain views the world that shapes your reality .
And if we can change the lens , not only can we change your happiness , we can change every single educational and business outcome at the same time .
When I applied to Harvard , I applied on a dare .
I didn &apos;t expect to get in , and my family had no money for college .
When I got a military scholarship two weeks later , they allowed me to go .
Suddenly , something that wasn &apos;t even a possibility became a reality .
When I went there , I assumed everyone else would see it as a privilege as well , that they &apos;d be excited to be there .
Even if you &apos;re in a classroom full of people smarter than you , you &apos;d be happy just to be in that classroom , which is what I felt .
But what I found there is , while some people experience that , when I graduated after my four years and then spent the next eight years living in the dorms with the students -- Harvard asked me to ; I wasn &apos;t that guy .
I was an officer of Harvard to counsel students through the difficult four years .
And what I found in my research and my teaching is that these students , no matter how happy they were with their original success of getting into the school , two weeks later their brains were focused , not on the privilege of being there , nor on their philosophy or their physics .
Their brain was focused on the competition , the workload , the hassles , the stresses , the complaints .
When I first went in there , I walked into the freshmen dining hall , which is where my friends from Waco , Texas , which is where I grew up -- I know some of you have heard of it .
When they &apos;d come to visit me , they &apos;d look around , they &apos;d say , &quot; This freshman dining hall looks like something out of Hogwart &apos;s from the movie &quot; Harry Potter , &quot; which it does .
This is Hogwart &apos;s from the movie &quot; Harry Potter &quot; and that &apos;s Harvard .
And when they see this , they say , &quot; Shawn , why do you waste your time studying happiness at Harvard ?
Seriously , what does a Harvard student possibly have to be unhappy about ? &quot;
Embedded within that question is the key to understanding the science of happiness .
Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels , when in reality , if I know everything about your external world , I can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness .
90 percent of your long-term happiness is predicted not by the external world , but by the way your brain processes the world .
And if we change it , if we change our formula for happiness and success , what we can do is change the way that we can then affect reality .
What we found is that only 25 percent of job successes are predicted by I.Q.
75 percent of job successes are predicted by your optimism levels , your social support and your ability to see stress as a challenge instead of as a threat .
I talked to a boarding school up in New England , probably the most prestigious boarding school , and they said , &quot; We already know that .
So every year , instead of just teaching our students , we also have a wellness week .
And we &apos;re so excited . Monday night we have the world &apos;s leading expert coming in to speak about adolescent depression .
Tuesday night it &apos;s school violence and bullying .
Wednesday night is eating disorders .
Thursday night is elicit drug use .
And Friday night we &apos;re trying to decide between risky sex or happiness . &quot;
I said , &quot; That &apos;s most people &apos;s Friday nights . &quot;
Which I &apos;m glad you liked , but they did not like that at all .
Silence on the phone .
And into the silence , I said , &quot; I &apos;d be happy to speak at your school , but just so you know , that &apos;s not a wellness week , that &apos;s a sickness week .
What you &apos;ve done is you &apos;ve outlined all the negative things that can happen , but not talked about the positive . &quot;
The absence of disease is not health .
Here &apos;s how we get to health : We need to reverse the formula for happiness and success .
In the last three years , I &apos;ve traveled to 45 different countries , working with schools and companies in the midst of an economic downturn .
And what I found is that most companies and schools follow a formula for success , which is this : If I work harder , I &apos;ll be more successful .
And if I &apos;m more successful , then I &apos;ll be happier .
That undergirds most of our parenting styles , our managing styles , the way that we motivate our behavior .
And the problem is it &apos;s scientifically broken and backwards for two reasons .
First , every time your brain has a success , you just changed the goalpost of what success looked like .
You got good grades , now you have to get better grades , you got into a good school and after you get into a better school , you got a good job , now you have to get a better job , you hit your sales target , we &apos;re going to change your sales target .
And if happiness is on the opposite side of success , your brain never gets there .
What we &apos;ve done is we &apos;ve pushed happiness over the cognitive horizon as a society .
And that &apos;s because we think we have to be successful , then we &apos;ll be happier .
But the real problem is our brains work in the opposite order .
If you can raise somebody &apos;s level of positivity in the present , then their brain experiences what we now call a happiness advantage , which is your brain at positive performs significantly better than it does at negative , neutral or stressed .
Your intelligence rises , your creativity rises , your energy levels rise .
In fact , what we &apos;ve found is that every single business outcome improves .
Your brain at positive is 31 percent more productive than your brain at negative , neutral or stressed .
You &apos;re 37 percent better at sales .
Doctors are 19 percent faster , more accurate at coming up with the correct diagnosis when positive instead of negative , neutral or stressed .
Which means we can reverse the formula .
If we can find a way of becoming positive in the present , then our brains work even more successfully as we &apos;re able to work harder , faster and more intelligently .
What we need to be able to do is to reverse this formula so we can start to see what our brains are actually capable of .
Because dopamine , which floods into your system when you &apos;re positive , has two functions .
Not only does it make you happier , it turns on all of the learning centers in your brain allowing you to adapt to the world in a different way .
We &apos;ve found that there are ways that you can train your brain to be able to become more positive .
In just a two-minute span of time done for 21 days in a row , we can actually rewire your brain , allowing your brain to actually work more optimistically and more successfully .
We &apos;ve done these things in research now in every single company that I &apos;ve worked with , getting them to write down three new things that they &apos;re grateful for for 21 days in a row , three new things each day .
And at the end of that , their brain starts to retain a pattern of scanning the world , not for the negative , but for the positive first .
Journaling about one positive experience you &apos;ve had over the past 24 hours allows your brain to relive it .
Exercise teaches your brain that your behavior matters .
We find that meditation allows your brain to get over the cultural ADHD that we &apos;ve been creating by trying to do multiple tasks at once and allows our brains to focus on the task at hand .
And finally , random acts of kindness are conscious acts of kindness .
We get people , when they open up their inbox , to write one positive email praising or thanking somebody in their social support network .
And by doing these activities and by training your brain just like we train our bodies , what we &apos;ve found is we can reverse the formula for happiness and success , and in doing so , not only create ripples of positivity , but create a real revolution .
Thank you very much .
Dan Ariely : What makes us feel good about our work ?
What motivates us to work ? Contrary to conventional wisdom , it isn &apos;t just money . But it &apos;s not exactly joy either . It seems that most of us thrive by making constant progress and feeling a sense of purpose . Behavioral economist Dan Ariely presents two eye-opening experiments that reveal our unexpected and nuanced attitudes toward meaning in our work . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
I want to talk a little bit today about labor and work .
When we think about how people work , the naive intuition we have is that people are like rats in a maze -- that all people care about is money , and the moment we give people money , we can direct them to work one way , we can direct them to work another way .
This is why we give bonuses to bankers and pay in all kinds of ways .
And we really have this incredibly simplistic view of why people work and what the labor market looks like .
At the same time , if you think about it , there &apos;s all kinds of strange behaviors in the world around us .
Think about something like mountaineering and mountain climbing .
If you read books of people who climb mountains , difficult mountains , do you think that those books are full of moments of joy and happiness ?
No , they are full of misery .
In fact , it &apos;s all about frostbite and difficulty to walk and difficulty of breathing -- cold , challenging circumstances .
And if people were just trying to be happy , the moment they would get to the top , they would say , &quot; This was a terrible mistake .
I &apos;ll never do it again . &quot;
&quot; Instead , let me sit on a beach somewhere drinking mojitos . &quot;
But instead , people go down , and after they recover , they go up again .
And if you think about mountain climbing as an example , it suggests all kinds of things .
It suggests that we care about reaching the end , a peak .
It suggests that we care about the fight , about the challenge .
It suggests that there &apos;s all kinds of other things that motivate us to work or behave in all kinds of ways .
And for me personally , I started thinking about this after a student came to visit me .
This was a student that was one of my students a few years earlier .
And he came one day back to campus .
And he told me the following story : He said that for more than two weeks , he was working on a PowerPoint presentation .
He was working in a big bank .
This was in preparation for a merger and acquisition .
And he was working very hard on this presentation -- graphs , tables , information .
He stayed late at night every day .
And the day before it was due , he sent his PowerPoint presentation to his boss , and his boss wrote him back and said , &quot; Nice presentation , but the merger is canceled . &quot;
And the guy was deeply depressed .
Now at the moment when he was working , he was actually quite happy .
Every night he was enjoying his work , he was staying late , he was perfecting this PowerPoint presentation .
But knowing that nobody would ever watch that made him quite depressed .
So I started thinking about how do we experiment with this idea of the fruits of our labor .
And to start with , we created a little experiment in which we gave people Legos , and we asked them to build with Legos .
And for some people , we gave them Legos and we said , &quot; Hey , would you like to build this Bionicle for three dollars ?
We &apos;ll pay you three dollars for it . &quot;
And people said yes , and they built with these Legos .
And when they finished , we took it , we put it under the table , and we said , &quot; Would you like to build another one , this time for $ 2.70 ? &quot;
If they said yes , we gave them another one .
And when they finished , we asked them , &quot; Do you want to build another one ? &quot; for $ 2.40 , $ 2.10 , and so on , until at some point people said , &quot; No more . It &apos;s not worth it for me . &quot;
This was what we called the meaningful condition .
People built one Bionicle after another .
After they finished every one of them , we put them under the table .
And we told them that at the end of the experiment , we will take all these Bionicles , we will disassemble them , we will put them back in the boxes , and we will use it for the next participant .
There was another condition .
This other condition was inspired by David , my student .
And this other condition we called the Sisyphic condition .
And if you remember the story about Sisyphus , Sisyphus was punished by the gods to push the same rock up a hill , and when he almost got to the end , the rock would roll over , and he would have to start again .
And you can think about this as the essence of doing futile work .
You can imagine that if he pushed the rock on different hills , at least he would have some sense of progress .
Also , if you look at prison movies , sometimes the way that the guards torture the prisoners is to get them to dig a hole and when the prisoner is finished , they ask him to fill the hole back up and then dig again .
There &apos;s something about this cyclical version of doing something over and over and over that seems to be particularly demotivating .
So in the second condition of this experiment , that &apos;s exactly what we did .
We asked people , &quot; Would you like to build one Bionicle for three dollars ? &quot;
And if they said yes , they built it .
Then we asked them , &quot; Do you want to build another one for $ 2.70 ? &quot;
And if they said yes , we gave them a new one , and as they were building it , we took apart the one that they just finished .
And when they finished that , we said , &quot; Would you like to build another one , this time for 30 cents less ? &quot;
And if they said yes , we gave them the one that they built and we broke .
So this was an endless cycle of them building and us destroying in front of their eyes .
Now what happens when you compare these two conditions ?
The first thing that happened was that people built many more Bionicles -- they built 11 versus seven -- in the meaningful condition versus the Sisyphus condition .
And by the way , we should point out that this was not a big meaning .
People were not curing cancer or building bridges .
People were building Bionicles for a few cents .
And not only that , everybody knew that the Bionicles would be destroyed quite soon .
So there was not a real opportunity for big meaning .
But even the small meaning made a difference .
Now we had another version of this experiment .
In this other version of the experiment , we didn &apos;t put people in this situation , we just described to them the situation , much as I am describing to you now , and we asked them to predict what the result would be .
What happened ?
People predicted the right direction but not the right magnitude .
People who were just given the description of the experiment said that in the meaningful condition people would probably build one more Bionicle .
So people understand that meaning is important , they just don &apos;t understand the magnitude of the importance , the extent to which it &apos;s important .
There was one other piece of data we looked at .
If you think about it , there are some people who love Legos and some people who don &apos;t .
And you would speculate that the people who love Legos will build more Legos , even for less money , because after all , they get more internal joy from it .
And the people who love Legos less will build less Legos because the enjoyment that they derive from it is lower .
And that &apos;s actually what we found in the meaningful condition .
There was a very nice correlation between love of Lego and the amount of Legos people built .
What happened in the Sisyphic condition ?
In that condition the correlation was zero .
There was no relationship between the love of Lego and how much people built , which suggests to me that with this manipulation of breaking things in front of people &apos;s eyes , we basically crushed any joy that they could get out of this activity .
We basically eliminated it .
Soon after I finished running this experiment , I went to talk to a big software company in Seattle .
I can &apos;t tell you who they were , but they were a big company in Seattle .
And this was a group within this software company that was put in a different building .
And they asked them to innovate and create the next big product for this company .
And the week before I showed up , the CEO of this big software company went to that group , 200 engineers , and canceled the project .
And I stood there in front of 200 of the most depressed people I &apos;ve ever talked to .
And I described to them some of these Lego experiments , and they said they felt like they had just been through that experiment .
And I asked them , I said , &quot; How many of you now show up to work later than you used to ? &quot;
And everybody raised their hand .
I said , &quot; How many of you now go home earlier than you used to ? &quot;
And everybody raised their hand .
I asked them , &quot; How many of you now add not-so-kosher things to your expense reports ? &quot;
And they didn &apos;t really raise their hands , but they took me out to dinner and showed me what they could do with expense reports .
And then I asked them , I said , &quot; What could the CEO have done to make you not as depressed ? &quot;
And they came up with all kinds of ideas .
They said the CEO could have asked them to present to the whole company about their journey over the last two years and what they decided to do .
He could have asked them to think about which aspect of their technology could fit with other parts of the organization .
He could have asked them to build some prototypes , some next-generation prototypes , and seen how they would work .
But the thing is that any one of those would require some effort and motivation .
And I think the CEO basically did not understand the importance of meaning .
If the CEO , just like our participants , thought the essence of meaning is unimportant , then he &#91; wouldn &apos;t &#93; care .
And he would tell them , &quot; At the moment I directed you in this way , and now that I am directing you in this way , everything will be okay . &quot;
But if you understood how important meaning is , then you would figure out that it &apos;s actually important to spend some time , energy and effort in getting people to care more about what they &apos;re doing .
The next experiment was slightly different .
We took a sheet of paper with random letters , and we asked people to find pairs of letters that were identical next to each other .
That was the task .
And people did the first sheet .
And then we asked them if they wanted to do the next sheet for a little bit less money and the next sheet for a little bit less money , and so on and so forth .
And we had three conditions .
In the first condition , people wrote their name on the sheet , found all the pairs of letters , gave it to the experimenter .
The experimenter would look at it , scan it from top to bottom , say &quot; uh huh &quot; and put it on the pile next to them .
In the second condition , people did not write their name on it .
The experimenter looked at it , took the sheet of paper , did not look at it , did not scan it , and simply put it on the pile of pages .
So you take a piece , you just put it on the side .
And in the third condition , the experimenter got the sheet of paper and directly put it into a shredder .
What happened in those three conditions ?
In this plot I &apos;m showing you at what pay rate people stopped .
So low numbers mean that people worked harder . They worked for much longer .
In the acknowledged condition , people worked all the way down to 15 cents .
At 15 cents per page , they basically stopped these efforts .
In the shredder condition , it was twice as much -- 30 cents per sheet .
And this is basically the result we had before .
You shred people &apos;s efforts , output , you get them not to be as happy with what they &apos;re doing .
But I should point out , by the way , that in the shredder condition , people could have cheated .
They could have done not so good work , because they realized that people were just shredding it .
So maybe the first sheet you would do good work , but then you see nobody is really testing it , so you would do more and more and more .
So in fact , in the shredder condition , people could have submitted more work and gotten more money and put less effort into it .
But what about the ignored condition ?
Would the ignored condition be more like the acknowledged or more like the shredder , or somewhere in the middle ?
It turns out it was almost like the shredder .
Now there &apos;s good news and bad news here .
The bad news is that ignoring the performance of people is almost as bad as shredding their effort in front of their eyes .
Ignoring gets you a whole way out there .
The good news is that by simply looking at something that somebody has done , scanning it and saying &quot; uh huh , &quot; that seems to be quite sufficient to dramatically improve people &apos;s motivations .
So the good news is that adding motivation doesn &apos;t seem to be so difficult .
The bad news is that eliminating motivations seems to be incredibly easy , and if we don &apos;t think about it carefully , we might overdo it .
So this is all in terms of negative motivation or eliminating negative motivation .
The next part I want to show you is something about the positive motivation .
So there is a store in the U.S. called IKEA .
And IKEA is a store with kind of okay furniture that takes a long time to assemble .
And I don &apos;t know about you , but every time I assemble one of those , it takes me much longer , it &apos;s much more effortful , it &apos;s much more confusing .
I put things in the wrong way .
I can &apos;t say enjoy those pieces .
I can &apos;t say I enjoy the process .
But when I finish it , I seem to like those IKEA pieces of furniture more than I like other ones .
And there &apos;s an old story about cake mixes .
So when they started cake mixes in the &apos; 40s , they would take this powder and they would put it in a box , and they would ask housewives to basically pour it in , stir some water in it , mix it , put it in the oven , and -- voila ! -- you had cake .
But it turns out they were very unpopular .
People did not want them .
And they thought about all kinds of reasons for that .
Maybe the taste was not good .
No , the taste was great .
What they figured out was that there was not enough effort involved .
It was so easy that nobody could serve cake to their guests and say , &quot; Here is my cake . &quot;
No , no , no , it was somebody else &apos;s cake .
It was as if you bought it in the store .
It didn &apos;t really feel like your own .
So what did they do ?
They took the eggs and the milk out of the powder .
Now you had to break the eggs and add them .
You had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it .
Now it was your cake . Now everything was fine .
Now I think a little bit like the IKEA effect , by getting people to work harder , they actually got them to love what they &apos;re doing to a higher degree .
So how do we look at this question experimentally ?
We asked people to build some origami .
We gave them instructions on how to create origami , and we gave them a sheet of paper .
And these were all novices , and they built something that was really quite ugly -- nothing like a frog or a crane .
But then we told them , we said , &quot; Look , this origami really belongs to us .
You worked for us , but I &apos;ll tell you what , we &apos;ll sell it to you .
How much do you want to pay for it ? &quot;
And we measured how much they were willing to pay for it .
And we had two types of people .
We had the people who built it , and we had the people who did not build it and just looked at it as external observers .
And what we found was that the builders thought that these were beautiful pieces of origami , and they were willing to pay for them five times more than the people who just evaluated them externally .
Now you could say , if you were a builder , do you think that , &quot; Oh , I love this origami , but I know that nobody else would love it ? &quot;
Or do you think , &quot; I love this origami , and everybody else will love it as well ? &quot;
Which one of those two is correct ?
Turns out the builders not only loved the origami more , they thought that everybody would see the world in their view .
They thought everybody else would love it more as well .
In the next version we tried to do the IKEA effect .
We tried to make it more difficult .
So for some people we gave the same task .
For some people we made it harder by hiding the instructions .
At the top of the sheet , we had little diagrams of how do you fold origami .
For some people we just eliminated that .
So now this was tougher . What happened ?
Well in an objective way , the origami now was uglier , it was more difficult .
Now when we looked at the easy origami , we saw the same thing : Builders loved it more , evaluators loved it less .
When you looked at the hard instructions , the effect was larger .
Why ? Because now the builders loved it even more .
They put all this extra effort into it .
And evaluators ? They loved it even less .
Because in reality it was even uglier than the first version .
Of course , this tells you something about how we evaluate things .
Now think about kids .
Imagine I asked you , &quot; How much would you sell your kids for ? &quot;
Your memories and associations and so on .
Most people would say for a lot , a lot of money -- on good days .
But imagine this was slightly different .
Imagine if you did not have your kids , and one day you went to the park and you met some kids , and they were just like your kids .
And you played with them for a few hours .
And when you were about to leave , the parents said , &quot; Hey , by the way , just before you leave , if you &apos;re interested , they &apos;re for sale . &quot;
How much would you pay for them now ?
Most people say not that much .
And this is because our kids are so valuable , not just because of who they are , but because of us , because they are so connected to us and because of the time and connection .
And by the way , if you think that IKEA instructions are not good , think about the instructions that come with kids .
Those are really tough .
By the way , these are my kids , which , of course , are wonderful and so on .
Which comes to tell you one more thing , which is , much like our builders , when they look at the creature of their creation , we don &apos;t see that other people don &apos;t see things our way .
Let me say one last comment .
If you think about Adam Smith versus Karl Marx , Adam Smith had the very important notion of efficiency .
He gave an example of a pin factory .
He said pins have 12 different steps , and if one person does all 12 steps , production is very low .
But if you get one person to do step one and one person to do step two and step three and so on , production can increase tremendously .
And indeed , this is a great example and the reason for the Industrial Revolution and efficiency .
Karl Marx , on the other hand , said that the alienation of labor is incredibly important in how people think about the connection to what they are doing .
And if you make all 12 steps , you care about the pin .
But if you make one step every time , maybe you don &apos;t care as much .
And I think that in the Industrial Revolution , Adam Smith was more correct than Karl Marx , but the reality is that we &apos;ve switched and now we &apos;re in the knowledge economy .
And you can ask yourself , what happens in a knowledge economy ?
Is efficiency still more important than meaning ?
I think the answer is no .
I think that as we move to situations in which people have to decide on their own about how much effort , attention , caring , how connected they feel to it , are they thinking about labor on the way to work and in the shower and so on , all of a sudden Marx has more things to say to us .
So when we think about labor , we usually think about motivation and payment as the same thing , but the reality is that we should probably add all kinds of things to it -- meaning , creation , challenges , ownership , identity , pride , etc .
And the good news is that if we added all of those components and thought about them , how do we create our own meaning , pride , motivation , and how do we do it in our workplace and for the employees , I think we could get people to both be more productive and happier .
Thank you very much .
Amy Lockwood : Selling condoms in the Congo
HIV is a serious problem in the DR Congo , and aid agencies have flooded the country with free and cheap condoms . But few people are using them . Why ? &quot; Reformed marketer &quot; Amy Lockwood offers a surprising answer that upends a traditional model of philanthropy .
I am a reformed marketer , and I now work in international development .
In October , I spent some time in the Democratic Republic of Congo , which is the &#91; second &#93; largest country in Africa .
In fact , it &apos;s as large as Western Europe , but it only has 300 miles of paved roads .
The DRC is a dangerous place .
In the past 10 years , five million people have died due to a war in the east .
But war isn &apos;t the only reason that life is difficult in the DRC .
There are many health issues as well .
In fact , the HIV prevalence rate is 1.3 percent among adults .
This might not sound like a large number , but in a country with 76 million people , it means there are 930,000 that are infected .
And due to the poor infrastructure , only 25 percent of those are receiving the life-saving drugs that they need .
Which is why , in part , donor agencies provide condoms at low or no cost .
And so while I was in the DRC , I spent a lot of time talking to people about condoms , including Damien .
Damien runs a hotel outside of Kinshasa .
It &apos;s a hotel that &apos;s only open until midnight , so it &apos;s not a place that you stay .
But it is a place where sex workers and their clients come .
Now Damien knows all about condoms , but he doesn &apos;t sell them .
He said there &apos;s just not in demand .
It &apos;s not surprising , because only three percent of people in the DRC use condoms .
Joseph and Christine , who run a pharmacy where they sell a number of these condoms , said despite the fact that donor agencies provide them at low or no cost , and they have marketing campaigns that go along with them , their customers don &apos;t buy the branded versions .
They like the generics .
And as a marketer , I found that curious .
And so I started to look at what the marketing looked like .
And it turns out that there are three main messages used by the donor agencies for these condoms : fear , financing and fidelity .
They name the condoms things like Vive , &quot; to live &quot; or Trust .
They package it with the red ribbon that reminds us of HIV , put it in boxes that remind you who paid for them , show pictures of your wife or husband and tell you to protect them or to act prudently .
Now these are not the kinds of things that someone is thinking about just before they go get a condom .
What is it that you think about just before you get a condom ?
Sex !
And the private companies that sell condoms in these places , they understand this .
Their marketing is slightly different .
The name might not be much different , but the imagery sure is .
Some brands are aspirational , and certainly the packaging is incredibly provocative .
And this made me think that perhaps the donor agencies had just missed out on a key aspect of marketing : understanding who &apos;s the audience .
And for donor agencies , unfortunately , the audience tends to be people that aren &apos;t even in the country they &apos;re working &#91; in &#93; .
It &apos;s people back home , people that support their work , people like these .
But if what we &apos;re really trying to do is stop the spread of HIV , we need to think about the customer , the people whose behavior needs to change -- the couples , the young women , the young men -- whose lives depend on it .
And so the lesson is this : it doesn &apos;t really matter what you &apos;re selling ; you just have to think about who is your customer , and what are the messages that are going to get them to change their behavior .
It might just save their lives .
Thank you .
Vicki Arroyo : Let &apos;s prepare for our new climate
As Vicki Arroyo says , it &apos;s time to prepare our homes and cities for our changing climate , with its increased risk of flooding , drought and uncertainty . She illustrates this inspiring talk with bold projects from cities all over the world -- local examples of thinking ahead .
This is the skyline of my hometown , New Orleans .
It was a great place to grow up , but it &apos;s one of the most vulnerable spots in the world .
Half the city is already below sea level .
In 2005 , the world watched as New Orleans and the Gulf Coast were devastated by Hurricane Katrina .
One thousand , eight hundred and thirty-six people died . Nearly 300,000 homes were lost .
These are my mother &apos;s , at the top -- although that &apos;s not her car , it was carried there by floodwaters up to the roof -- and that &apos;s my sister &apos;s , below .
Fortunately , they and other family members got out in time , but they lost their homes , and as you can see , just about everything in them .
Other parts of the world have been hit by storms in even more devastating ways .
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis and its aftermath killed 138,000 in Myanmar .
Climate change is affecting our homes , our communities , our way of life . We should be preparing at every scale and at every opportunity .
This talk is about being prepared for , and resilient to the changes that are coming and that will affect our homes and our collective home , the Earth .
The changes in these times won &apos;t affect us all equally .
There are important distributional consequences , and they &apos;re not what you always might think .
In New Orleans , the elderly and female-headed households were among the most vulnerable .
For those in vulnerable , low-lying nations , how do you put a dollar value on losing your country where you ancestors are buried ? And where will your people go ?
And how will they cope in a foreign land ?
Will there be tensions over immigration , or conflicts over competition for limited resources ?
It &apos;s already fueled conflicts in Chad and Darfur .
Like it or not , ready or not , this is our future .
Sure , some are looking for opportunities in this new world .
That &apos;s the Russians planting a flag on the ocean bottom to stake a claim for minerals under the receding Arctic sea ice .
But while there might be some short-term individual winners , our collective losses will far outweigh them .
Look no further than the insurance industry as they struggle to cope with mounting catastrophic losses from extreme weather events .
The military gets it . They call climate change a threat multiplier that could harm stability and security , while governments around the world are evaluating how to respond .
So what can we do ? How can we prepare and adapt ?
I &apos;d like to share three sets of examples , starting with adapting to violent storms and floods .
In New Orleans , the I-10 Twin Spans , with sections knocked out in Katrina , have been rebuilt 21 feet higher to allow for greater storm surge .
And these raised and energy-efficient homes were developed by Brad Pitt and Make It Right for the hard-hit Ninth Ward .
The devastated church my mom attends has been not only rebuilt higher , it &apos;s poised to become the first Energy Star church in the country .
They &apos;re selling electricity back to the grid thanks to solar panels , reflective paint and more .
Their March electricity bill was only 48 dollars .
Now these are examples of New Orleans rebuilding in this way , but better if others act proactively with these changes in mind .
For example , in Galveston , here &apos;s a resilient home that survived Hurricane Ike , when others on neighboring lots clearly did not .
And around the world , satellites and warning systems are saving lives in flood-prone areas such as Bangladesh .
But as important as technology and infrastructure are , perhaps the human element is even more critical .
We need better planning and systems for evacuation .
We need to better understand how people make decisions in times of crisis , and why .
While it &apos;s true that many who died in Katrina did not have access to transportation , others who did refused to leave as the storm approached , often because available transportation and shelters refused to allow them to take their pets .
Imagine leaving behind your own pet in an evacuation or a rescue .
Fortunately in 2006 , Congress passed the Pet Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act ‚Äî it spells &quot; PETS &quot; ‚Äî to change that .
Second , preparing for heat and drought .
Farmers are facing challenges of drought from Asia to Africa , from Australia to Oklahoma , while heat waves linked with climate change have killed tens of thousands of people in Western Europe in 2003 , and again in Russia in 2010 .
In Ethiopia , 70 percent , that &apos;s 7-0 percent of the population , depends on rainfall for its livelihood .
Oxfam and Swiss Re , together with Rockefeller Foundation , are helping farmers like this one build hillside terraces and find other ways to conserve water , but they &apos;re also providing for insurance when the droughts do come .
The stability this provides is giving the farmers the confidence to invest .
It &apos;s giving them access to affordable credit .
It &apos;s allowing them to become more productive so that they can afford their own insurance over time , without assistance .
It &apos;s a virtuous cycle , and one that could be replicated throughout the developing world .
After a lethal 1995 heat wave turned refrigerator trucks from the popular Taste of Chicago festival into makeshift morgues , Chicago became a recognized leader , tamping down on the urban heat island impact through opening cooling centers , outreach to vulnerable neighborhoods , planting trees , creating cool white or vegetated green roofs .
This is City Hall &apos;s green roof , next to Cook County &apos;s &#91; portion of the &#93; roof , which is 77 degrees Fahrenheit hotter at the surface .
Washington , D.C. , last year , actually led the nation in new green roofs installed , and they &apos;re funding this in part thanks to a five-cent tax on plastic bags .
They &apos;re splitting the cost of installing these green roofs with home and building owners .
The roofs not only temper urban heat island impact but they save energy , and therefore money , the emissions that cause climate change , and they also reduce stormwater runoff .
So some solutions to heat can provide for win-win-wins .
Third , adapting to rising seas .
Sea level rise threatens coastal ecosystems , agriculture , even major cities . This is what one to two meters of sea level rise looks like in the Mekong Delta .
That &apos;s where half of Vietnam &apos;s rice is grown .
Infrastructure is going to be affected .
Airports around the world are located on the coast .
It makes sense , right ? There &apos;s open space , the planes can take off and land without worrying about creating noise or avoiding tall buildings .
Here &apos;s just one example , San Francisco Airport , with 16 inches or more of flooding .
Imagine the staggering cost of protecting this vital infrastructure with levees .
But there might be some changes in store that you might not imagine . For example , planes require more runway for takeoff because the heated , less dense air , provides for less lift .
San Francisco is also spending 40 million dollars to rethink and redesign its water and sewage treatment , as water outfall pipes like this one can be flooded with seawater , causing backups at the plant , harming the bacteria that are needed to treat the waste .
So these outfall pipes have been retrofitted to shut seawater off from entering the system .
Beyond these technical solutions , our work at the Georgetown Climate Center with communities encourages them to look at what existing legal and policy tools are available and to consider how they can accommodate change .
For example , in land use , which areas do you want to protect , through adding a seawall , for example , alter , by raising buildings , or retreat from , to allow the migration of important natural systems , such as wetlands or beaches ?
Other examples to consider . In the U.K. , the Thames Barrier protects London from storm surge .
The Asian Cities Climate &#91; Change &#93; Resilience Network is restoring vital ecosystems like forest mangroves .
These are not only important ecosystems in their own right , but they also serve as a buffer to protect inland communities .
New York City is incredibly vulnerable to storms , as you can see from this clever sign , and to sea level rise , and to storm surge , as you can see from the subway flooding .
But back above ground , these raised ventilation grates for the subway system show that solutions can be both functional and attractive . In fact , in New York , San Francisco and London , designers have envisioned ways to better integrate the natural and built environments with climate change in mind .
I think these are inspiring examples of what &apos;s possible when we feel empowered to plan for a world that will be different .
But now , a word of caution .
Adaptation &apos;s too important to be left to the experts .
Why ? Well , there are no experts .
We &apos;re entering uncharted territory , and yet our expertise and our systems are based on the past .
&quot; Stationarity &quot; is the notion that we can anticipate the future based on the past , and plan accordingly , and this principle governs much of our engineering , our design of critical infrastructure , city water systems , building codes , even water rights and other legal precedents .
But we can simply no longer rely on established norms .
We &apos;re operating outside the bounds of CO2 concentrations that the planet has seen for hundreds of thousands of years .
The larger point I &apos;m trying to make is this .
It &apos;s up to us to look at our homes and our communities , our vulnerabilities and our exposures to risk , and to find ways to not just survive , but to thrive , and it &apos;s up to us to plan and to prepare and to call on our government leaders and require them to do the same , even while they address the underlying causes of climate change .
There are no quick fixes .
There are no one-size-fits-all solutions .
We &apos;re all learning by doing .
But the operative word is doing .
Thank you .
Aubrey de Grey : A roadmap to end aging
Cambridge researcher Aubrey de Grey argues that aging is merely a disease -- and a curable one at that . Humans age in seven basic ways , he says , all of which can be averted .
18 minutes is an absolutely brutal time limit , so I &apos;m going to dive straight in , right at the point where I get this thing to work .
Here we go . I &apos;m going to talk about five different things .
I &apos;m going to talk about why defeating aging is desirable .
I &apos;m going to talk about why we have to get our shit together , and actually talk about this a bit more than we do .
I &apos;m going to talk about feasibility as well , of course .
I &apos;m going to talk about why we are so fatalistic about doing anything about aging .
And then I &apos;m going spend perhaps the second half of the talk talking about , you know , how we might actually be able to prove that fatalism is wrong , namely , by actually doing something about it .
I &apos;m going to do that in two steps .
The first one I &apos;m going to talk about is how to get from a relatively modest amount of life extension -- which I &apos;m going to define as 30 years , applied to people who are already in middle-age when you start -- to a point which can genuinely be called defeating aging .
Namely , essentially an elimination of the relationship between how old you are and how likely you are to die in the next year -- or indeed , to get sick in the first place .
And of course , the last thing I &apos;m going to talk about is how to reach that intermediate step , that point of maybe 30 years life extension .
So I &apos;m going to start with why we should .
Now , I want to ask a question .
Hands up : anyone in the audience who is in favor of malaria ?
That was easy . OK .
OK . Hands up : anyone in the audience who &apos;s not sure whether malaria is a good thing or a bad thing ?
OK . So we all think malaria is a bad thing .
That &apos;s very good news , because I thought that was what the answer would be .
Now the thing is , I would like to put it to you that the main reason why we think that malaria is a bad thing is because of a characteristic of malaria that it shares with aging .
And here is that characteristic .
The only real difference is that aging kills considerably more people than malaria does .
Now , I like in an audience , in Britain especially , to talk about the comparison with foxhunting , which is something that was banned after a long struggle , by the government not very many months ago .
I mean , I know I &apos;m with a sympathetic audience here , but , as we know , a lot of people are not entirely persuaded by this logic .
And this is actually a rather good comparison , it seems to me .
You know , a lot of people said , &quot; Well , you know , city boys have no business telling us rural types what to do with our time .
It &apos;s a traditional part of the way of life , and we should be allowed to carry on doing it .
It &apos;s ecologically sound ; it stops the population explosion of foxes . &quot;
But ultimately , the government prevailed in the end , because the majority of the British public , and certainly the majority of members of Parliament , came to the conclusion that it was really something that should not be tolerated in a civilized society .
And I think that human aging shares all of these characteristics in spades .
What part of this do people not understand ?
It &apos;s not just about life , of course -- -- it &apos;s about healthy life , you know -- getting frail and miserable and dependent is no fun , whether or not dying may be fun .
So really , this is how I would like to describe it .
It &apos;s a global trance .
These are the sorts of unbelievable excuses that people give for aging .
And , I mean , OK , I &apos;m not actually saying that these excuses are completely valueless .
There are some good points to be made here , things that we ought to be thinking about , forward planning so that nothing goes too -- well , so that we minimize the turbulence when we actually figure out how to fix aging .
But these are completely crazy , when you actually remember your sense of proportion .
You know , these are arguments ; these are things that would be legitimate to be concerned about .
But the question is , are they so dangerous -- these risks of doing something about aging -- that they outweigh the downside of doing the opposite , namely , leaving aging as it is ?
Are these so bad that they outweigh condemning 100,000 people a day to an unnecessarily early death ?
You know , if you haven &apos;t got an argument that &apos;s that strong , then just don &apos;t waste my time , is what I say .
Now , there is one argument that some people do think really is that strong , and here it is .
People worry about overpopulation ; they say , &quot; Well , if we fix aging , no one &apos;s going to die to speak of , or at least the death toll is going to be much lower , only from crossing St. Giles carelessly .
And therefore , we &apos;re not going to be able to have many kids , and kids are really important to most people . &quot;
And that &apos;s true .
And you know , a lot of people try to fudge this question , and give answers like this .
I don &apos;t agree with those answers . I think they basically don &apos;t work .
I think it &apos;s true , that we will face a dilemma in this respect .
We will have to decide whether to have a low birth rate , or a high death rate .
A high death rate will , of course , arise from simply rejecting these therapies , in favor of carrying on having a lot of kids .
And , I say that that &apos;s fine -- the future of humanity is entitled to make that choice .
What &apos;s not fine is for us to make that choice on behalf of the future .
If we vacillate , hesitate , and do not actually develop these therapies , then we are condemning a whole cohort of people -- who would have been young enough and healthy enough to benefit from those therapies , but will not be , because we haven &apos;t developed them as quickly as we could -- we &apos;ll be denying those people an indefinite life span , and I consider that that is immoral .
That &apos;s my answer to the overpopulation question .
Right . So the next thing is , now why should we get a little bit more active on this ?
And the fundamental answer is that the pro-aging trance is not as dumb as it looks .
It &apos;s actually a sensible way of coping with the inevitability of aging .
Aging is ghastly , but it &apos;s inevitable , so , you know , we &apos;ve got to find some way to put it out of our minds , and it &apos;s rational to do anything that we might want to do , to do that .
Like , for example , making up these ridiculous reasons why aging is actually a good thing after all .
But of course , that only works when we have both of these components .
And as soon as the inevitability bit becomes a little bit unclear -- and we might be in range of doing something about aging -- this becomes part of the problem .
This pro-aging trance is what stops us from agitating about these things .
And that &apos;s why we have to really talk about this a lot -- evangelize , I will go so far as to say , quite a lot -- in order to get people &apos;s attention , and make people realize that they are in a trance in this regard .
So that &apos;s all I &apos;m going to say about that .
I &apos;m now going to talk about feasibility .
And the fundamental reason , I think , why we feel that aging is inevitable is summed up in a definition of aging that I &apos;m giving here .
A very simple definition .
Aging is a side effect of being alive in the first place , which is to say , metabolism .
This is not a completely tautological statement ; it &apos;s a reasonable statement .
Aging is basically a process that happens to inanimate objects like cars , and it also happens to us , despite the fact that we have a lot of clever self-repair mechanisms , because those self-repair mechanisms are not perfect .
So basically , metabolism , which is defined as basically everything that keeps us alive from one day to the next , has side effects .
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .
That &apos;s a fine definition . So we can put it this way : we can say that , you know , we have this chain of events .
And there are really two games in town , according to most people , with regard to postponing aging .
They &apos;re what I &apos;m calling here the &quot; gerontology approach &quot; and the &quot; geriatrics approach . &quot;
The geriatrician will intervene late in the day , when pathology is becoming evident , and the geriatrician will try and hold back the sands of time , and stop the accumulation of side effects from causing the pathology quite so soon .
Of course , it &apos;s a very short-term-ist strategy ; it &apos;s a losing battle , because the things that are causing the pathology are becoming more abundant as time goes on .
The gerontology approach looks much more promising on the surface , because , you know , prevention is better than cure .
But unfortunately the thing is that we don &apos;t understand metabolism very well .
In fact , we have a pitifully poor understanding of how organisms work -- even cells we &apos;re not really too good on yet .
We &apos;ve discovered things like , for example , RNA interference only a few years ago , and this is a really fundamental component of how cells work .
Basically , gerontology is a fine approach in the end , but it is not an approach whose time has come when we &apos;re talking about intervention .
So then , what do we do about that ?
I mean , that &apos;s a fine logic , that sounds pretty convincing , pretty ironclad , doesn &apos;t it ?
But it isn &apos;t .
Before I tell you why it isn &apos;t , I &apos;m going to go a little bit into what I &apos;m calling step two .
Just suppose , as I said , that we do acquire -- let &apos;s say we do it today for the sake of argument -- the ability to confer 30 extra years of healthy life on people who are already in middle age , let &apos;s say 55 .
I &apos;m going to call that &quot; robust human rejuvenation . &quot; OK .
What would that actually mean for how long people of various ages today -- or equivalently , of various ages at the time that these therapies arrive -- would actually live ?
In order to answer that question -- you might think it &apos;s simple , but it &apos;s not simple .
We can &apos;t just say , &quot; Well , if they &apos;re young enough to benefit from these therapies , then they &apos;ll live 30 years longer . &quot;
That &apos;s the wrong answer .
And the reason it &apos;s the wrong answer is because of progress .
There are two sorts of technological progress really , for this purpose .
There are fundamental , major breakthroughs , and there are incremental refinements of those breakthroughs .
Now , they differ a great deal in terms of the predictability of time frames .
Fundamental breakthroughs : very hard to predict how long it &apos;s going to take to make a fundamental breakthrough .
It was a very long time ago that we decided that flying would be fun , and it took us until 1903 to actually work out how to do it .
But after that , things were pretty steady and pretty uniform .
I think this is a reasonable sequence of events that happened in the progression of the technology of powered flight .
We can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like .
The incremental advances have added up to something which is not incremental anymore .
This is the sort of thing you see after a fundamental breakthrough .
And you see it in all sorts of technologies .
Computers : you can look at a more or less parallel time line , happening of course a bit later .
You can look at medical care . I mean , hygiene , vaccines , antibiotics -- you know , the same sort of time frame .
So I think that actually step two , that I called a step a moment ago , isn &apos;t a step at all .
That in fact , the people who are young enough to benefit from these first therapies that give this moderate amount of life extension , even though those people are already middle-aged when the therapies arrive , will be at some sort of cusp .
They will mostly survive long enough to receive improved treatments that will give them a further 30 or maybe 50 years .
In other words , they will be staying ahead of the game .
The therapies will be improving faster than the remaining imperfections in the therapies are catching up with us .
This is a very important point for me to get across .
Because , you know , most people , when they hear that I predict that a lot of people alive today are going to live to 1,000 or more , they think that I &apos;m saying that we &apos;re going to invent therapies in the next few decades that are so thoroughly eliminating aging that those therapies will let us live to 1,000 or more .
I &apos;m not saying that at all .
I &apos;m saying that the rate of improvement of those therapies will be enough .
They &apos;ll never be perfect , but we &apos;ll be able to fix the things that 200-year-olds die of , before we have any 200-year-olds .
And the same for 300 and 400 and so on .
I decided to give this a little name , which is &quot; longevity escape velocity . &quot;
Well , it seems to get the point across .
So , these trajectories here are basically how we would expect people to live , in terms of remaining life expectancy , as measured by their health , for given ages that they were at the time that these therapies arrive .
If you &apos;re already 100 , or even if you &apos;re 80 -- and an average 80-year-old , we probably can &apos;t do a lot for you with these therapies , because you &apos;re too close to death &apos;s door for the really initial , experimental therapies to be good enough for you .
You won &apos;t be able to withstand them .
But if you &apos;re only 50 , then there &apos;s a chance that you might be able to pull out of the dive and , you know -- -- eventually get through this and start becoming biologically younger in a meaningful sense , in terms of your youthfulness , both physical and mental , and in terms of your risk of death from age-related causes .
And of course , if you &apos;re a bit younger than that , then you &apos;re never really even going to get near to being fragile enough to die of age-related causes .
So this is a genuine conclusion that I come to , that the first 150-year-old -- we don &apos;t know how old that person is today , because we don &apos;t know how long it &apos;s going to take to get these first-generation therapies .
But irrespective of that age , I &apos;m claiming that the first person to live to 1,000 -- subject of course , to , you know , global catastrophes -- is actually , probably , only about 10 years younger than the first 150-year-old .
And that &apos;s quite a thought .
Alright , so finally I &apos;m going to spend the rest of the talk , my last seven-and-a-half minutes , on step one ; namely , how do we actually get to this moderate amount of life extension that will allow us to get to escape velocity ?
And in order to do that , I need to talk about mice a little bit .
I have a corresponding milestone to robust human rejuvenation .
I &apos;m calling it &quot; robust mouse rejuvenation , &quot; not very imaginatively .
And this is what it is .
I say we &apos;re going to take a long-lived strain of mouse , which basically means mice that live about three years on average .
We do exactly nothing to them until they &apos;re already two years old .
And then we do a whole bunch of stuff to them , and with those therapies , we get them to live , on average , to their fifth birthday .
So , in other words , we add two years -- we treble their remaining lifespan , starting from the point that we started the therapies .
The question then is , what would that actually mean for the time frame until we get to the milestone I talked about earlier for humans ?
Which we can now , as I &apos;ve explained , equivalently call either robust human rejuvenation or longevity escape velocity .
Secondly , what does it mean for the public &apos;s perception of how long it &apos;s going to take for us to get to those things , starting from the time we get the mice ?
And thirdly , the question is , what will it do to actually how much people want it ?
And it seems to me that the first question is entirely a biology question , and it &apos;s extremely hard to answer .
One has to be very speculative , and many of my colleagues would say that we should not do this speculation , that we should simply keep our counsel until we know more .
I say that &apos;s nonsense .
I say we absolutely are irresponsible if we stay silent on this .
We need to give our best guess as to the time frame , in order to give people a sense of proportion so that they can assess their priorities .
So , I say that we have a 50 / 50 chance of reaching this RHR milestone , robust human rejuvenation , within 15 years from the point that we get to robust mouse rejuvenation .
15 years from the robust mouse .
The public &apos;s perception will probably be somewhat better than that .
The public tends to underestimate how difficult scientific things are .
So they &apos;ll probably think it &apos;s five years away .
They &apos;ll be wrong , but that actually won &apos;t matter too much .
And finally , of course , I think it &apos;s fair to say that a large part of the reason why the public is so ambivalent about aging now is the global trance I spoke about earlier , the coping strategy .
That will be history at this point , because it will no longer be possible to believe that aging is inevitable in humans , since it &apos;s been postponed so very effectively in mice .
So we &apos;re likely to end up with a very strong change in people &apos;s attitudes , and of course that has enormous implications .
So in order to tell you now how we &apos;re going to get these mice , I &apos;m going to add a little bit to my description of aging .
I &apos;m going to use this word &quot; damage &quot; to denote these intermediate things that are caused by metabolism and that eventually cause pathology .
Because the critical thing about this is that even though the damage only eventually causes pathology , the damage itself is caused ongoing-ly throughout life , starting before we &apos;re born .
But it is not part of metabolism itself .
And this turns out to be useful .
Because we can re-draw our original diagram this way .
We can say that , fundamentally , the difference between gerontology and geriatrics is that gerontology tries to inhibit the rate at which metabolism lays down this damage .
And I &apos;m going to explain exactly what damage is in concrete biological terms in a moment .
And geriatricians try to hold back the sands of time by stopping the damage converting into pathology .
And the reason it &apos;s a losing battle is because the damage is continuing to accumulate .
So there &apos;s a third approach , if we look at it this way .
We can call it the &quot; engineering approach , &quot; and I claim that the engineering approach is within range .
The engineering approach does not intervene in any processes .
It does not intervene in this process or this one .
And that &apos;s good because it means that it &apos;s not a losing battle , and it &apos;s something that we are within range of being able to do , because it doesn &apos;t involve improving on evolution .
The engineering approach simply says , &quot; Let &apos;s go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely , but repair them quite a lot , so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist , that causes it to be pathogenic . &quot;
We know that this threshold exists , because we don &apos;t get age-related diseases until we &apos;re in middle age , even though the damage has been accumulating since before we were born .
Why do I say that we &apos;re in range ? Well , this is basically it .
The point about this slide is actually the bottom .
If we try to say which bits of metabolism are important for aging , we will be here all night , because basically all of metabolism is important for aging in one way or another .
This list is just for illustration ; it is incomplete .
The list on the right is also incomplete .
It &apos;s a list of types of pathology that are age-related , and it &apos;s just an incomplete list .
But I would like to claim to you that this list in the middle is actually complete -- this is the list of types of thing that qualify as damage , side effects of metabolism that cause pathology in the end , or that might cause pathology .
And there are only seven of them .
They &apos;re categories of things , of course , but there &apos;s only seven of them .
Cell loss , mutations in chromosomes , mutations in the mitochondria and so on .
First of all , I &apos;d like to give you an argument for why that list is complete .
Of course one can make a biological argument .
One can say , &quot; OK , what are we made of ? &quot;
We &apos;re made of cells and stuff between cells .
What can damage accumulate in ?
The answer is : long-lived molecules , because if a short-lived molecule undergoes damage , but then the molecule is destroyed -- like by a protein being destroyed by proteolysis -- then the damage is gone , too .
It &apos;s got to be long-lived molecules .
So , these seven things were all under discussion in gerontology a long time ago and that is pretty good news , because it means that , you know , we &apos;ve come a long way in biology in these 20 years , so the fact that we haven &apos;t extended this list is a pretty good indication that there &apos;s no extension to be done .
However , it &apos;s better than that ; we actually know how to fix them all , in mice , in principle -- and what I mean by in principle is , we probably can actually implement these fixes within a decade .
Some of them are partially implemented already , the ones at the top .
I haven &apos;t got time to go through them at all , but my conclusion is that , if we can actually get suitable funding for this , then we can probably develop robust mouse rejuvenation in only 10 years , but we do need to get serious about it .
We do need to really start trying .
So of course , there are some biologists in the audience , and I want to give some answers to some of the questions that you may have .
You may have been dissatisfied with this talk , but fundamentally you have to go and read this stuff .
I &apos;ve published a great deal on this ; I cite the experimental work on which my optimism is based , and there &apos;s quite a lot of detail there .
The detail is what makes me confident of my rather aggressive time frames that I &apos;m predicting here .
So if you think that I &apos;m wrong , you &apos;d better damn well go and find out why you think I &apos;m wrong .
And of course the main thing is that you shouldn &apos;t trust people who call themselves gerontologists because , as with any radical departure from previous thinking within a particular field , you know , you expect people in the mainstream to be a bit resistant and not really to take it seriously .
So , you know , you &apos;ve got to actually do your homework , in order to understand whether this is true .
And we &apos;ll just end with a few things .
One thing is , you know , you &apos;ll be hearing from a guy in the next session who said some time ago that he could sequence the human genome in half no time , and everyone said , &quot; Well , it &apos;s obviously impossible . &quot;
And you know what happened .
So , you know , this does happen .
We have various strategies -- there &apos;s the Methuselah Mouse Prize , which is basically an incentive to innovate , and to do what you think is going to work , and you get money for it if you win .
There &apos;s a proposal to actually put together an institute .
This is what &apos;s going to take a bit of money .
But , I mean , look -- how long does it take to spend that on the war in Iraq ?
Not very long . OK .
It &apos;s got to be philanthropic , because profits distract biotech , but it &apos;s basically got a 90 percent chance , I think , of succeeding in this .
And I think we know how to do it . And I &apos;ll stop there .
Thank you .
OK . I don &apos;t know if there &apos;s going to be any questions but I thought I would give people the chance .
Audience : Since you &apos;ve been talking about aging and trying to defeat it , why is it that you make yourself appear like an old man ?
AG : Because I am an old man . I am actually 158 .
Audience : Species on this planet have evolved with immune systems to fight off all the diseases so that individuals live long enough to procreate .
However , as far as I know , all the species have evolved to actually die , so when cells divide , the telomerase get shorter , and eventually species die .
So , why does -- evolution has -- seems to have selected against immortality , when it is so advantageous , or is evolution just incomplete ?
AG : Brilliant . Thank you for asking a question that I can answer with an uncontroversial answer .
I &apos;m going to tell you the genuine mainstream answer to your question , which I happen to agree with , which is that , no , aging is not a product of selection , evolution ; &#91; aging &#93; is simply a product of evolutionary neglect .
In other words , we have aging because it &apos;s hard work not to have aging ; you need more genetic pathways , more sophistication in your genes in order to age more slowly , and that carries on being true the longer you push it out .
So , to the extent that evolution doesn &apos;t matter , doesn &apos;t care whether genes are passed on by individuals , living a long time or by procreation , there &apos;s a certain amount of modulation of that , which is why different species have different lifespans , but that &apos;s why there are no immortal species .
The genes don &apos;t care but we do ?
AG : That &apos;s right .
Audience : Hello . I read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
If I project that , that would make me think that I would live until 120 if I don &apos;t crash on my motorbike .
That means that I &apos;m one of your subjects to become a 1,000-year-old ?
AG : If you lose a bit of weight .
Your numbers are a bit out .
The standard numbers are that lifespans have been growing at between one and two years per decade .
So , it &apos;s not quite as good as you might think , you might hope .
But I intend to move it up to one year per year as soon as possible .
Audience : I was told that many of the brain cells we have as adults are actually in the human embryo , and that the brain cells last 80 years or so .
If that is indeed true , biologically are there implications in the world of rejuvenation ?
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as opposed to a typical , you know , couple of months ?
AG : There are technical implications certainly .
Basically what we need to do is replace cells in those few areas of the brain that lose cells at a respectable rate , especially neurons , but we don &apos;t want to replace them any faster than that -- or not much faster anyway , because replacing them too fast would degrade cognitive function .
What I said about there being no non-aging species earlier on was a little bit of an oversimplification .
There are species that have no aging -- Hydra for example -- but they do it by not having a nervous system -- and not having any tissues in fact that rely for their function on very long-lived cells .
Lewis Pugh : My mind-shifting Everest swim
After he swam the North Pole , Lewis Pugh vowed never to take another cold-water dip . Then he heard of Lake Imja in the Himalayas , created by recent glacial melting , and Lake Pumori , a body of water at an altitude of 5300 m on Everest -- and so began a journey that would teach him a radical new way to approach swimming and think about climate change .
Last year when I was here , I was speaking to you about a swim which I did across the North Pole .
And while that swim took place three years ago , I can remember it as if it was yesterday .
I remember standing on the edge of the ice , about to dive into the water , and thinking to myself , I have never ever seen any place on this earth which is just so frightening .
The water is completely black .
The water is minus 1.7 degrees centigrade , or 29 degrees Fahrenheit .
It &apos;s flipping freezing in that water .
And then a thought came across my mind : if things go pear-shaped on this swim , how long will it take for my frozen body to sink the four and a half kilometers to the bottom of the ocean ?
And then I said to myself , I &apos;ve just got to get this thought And the only way I can dive into that freezing cold water and swim a kilometer is by listening to my iPod and really revving myself up , listening to everything from beautiful opera all the way across to Puff Daddy , and then committing myself a hundred percent -- there is nothing more powerful than the made-up mind -- and then walking up to the edge of the ice and just diving into the water .
And that swim took me 18 minutes and 50 seconds , and it felt like 18 days .
And I remember getting out of the water and my hands feeling so painful and looking down at my fingers , and my fingers were literally the size of sausages because -- you know , we &apos;re made partially of water -- when water freezes it expands , and so the cells in my fingers had frozen and expanded and burst .
And the most immediate thought when I came out of that water was the following : I &apos;m never , ever going to do another cold water swim in my life again .
Anyway , last year , I heard about the Himalayas and the melting of the -- and the melting of the glaciers because of climate change .
I heard about this lake , Lake Imja .
This lake has been formed in the last couple of years because of the melting of the glacier .
The glacier &apos;s gone all the way up the mountain and left in its place this big lake .
And I firmly believe that what we &apos;re seeing in the Himalayas is the next great , big battleground on this earth .
Nearly two billion people -- so one in three people on this earth -- rely on the water from the Himalayas .
And with a population increasing as quickly as it is , and with the water supply from these glaciers -- because of climate change -- decreasing so much , I think we have a real risk of instability .
North , you &apos;ve got China ; south , you &apos;ve India , Pakistan , Bangladesh , all these countries .
And so I decided to walk up to Mt . Everest , the highest mountain on this earth , and go and do a symbolic swim underneath the summit of Mt . Everest .
Now , I don &apos;t know if any of you have had the opportunity to go to Mt . Everest , but it &apos;s quite an ordeal getting up there .
28 great , big , powerful yaks carrying all the equipment up onto this mountain -- I don &apos;t just have my Speedo , but there &apos;s a big film crew who then send all the images around the world .
The other thing which was so challenging about this swim is not just the altitude .
I wanted to do the swim at 5,300 meters above sea level .
So it &apos;s right up in the heavens .
It &apos;s very , very difficult to breath . You get altitude sickness .
I feels like you &apos;ve got a man standing behind you with a hammer just hitting your head all the time .
That &apos;s not the worst part of it .
The worst part was this year was the year where they decided to do a big cleanup operation on Mt . Everest .
Many , many people have died on Mt . Everest , and this was the year they decided to go and recover all the bodies of the mountaineers and then bring them down the mountain .
And when you &apos;re walking up the mountain to attempt to do something which no human has ever done before , and , in fact , no fish -- there are no fish up there swimming at 5,300 meters -- When you &apos;re trying to do that , and then the bodies are coming past you , it humbles you , and you also realize very , very clearly that nature is so much more powerful than we are .
And we walked up this pathway , all the way up .
And to the right hand side of us was this great Khumbu Glacier .
And all the way along the glacier we saw these big pools of melting ice .
And then we got up to this small lake underneath the summit of Mt . Everest , and I prepared myself the same way as I &apos;ve always prepared myself , for this swim which was going to be so very difficult .
I put on my iPod , I listened to some music , I got myself as aggressive as possible -- but controlled aggression -- and then I hurled myself into that water .
I swam as quickly as I could for the first hundred meters , and then I realized very , very quickly , I had a huge problem on my hands .
I could barely breathe .
I was gasping for air .
I then began to choke , and then it quickly led to me vomiting in the water .
And it all happened so quickly : I then -- I don &apos;t know how it happened -- but I went underwater .
And luckily , the water was quite shallow , and I was able to push myself off the bottom of the lake and get up and then take another gasp of air .
And then I said , carry on . Carry on . Carry on .
I carried on for another five or six strokes , and then I had nothing in my body , and I went down to the bottom of the lake .
And I don &apos;t where I got it from , but I was able to somehow get to the side of the lake .
I &apos;ve heard it said that drowning is the most peaceful death that you can have .
I have never , ever heard such utter bollocks .
It is the most frightening and panicky feeling that you can have .
I got myself to the side of the lake .
My crew grabbed me , and then we walked as quickly as we could down -- over the rubble -- down to our camp .
And there , we sat down , and we did a debrief about what had gone wrong there on Mt . Everest .
And my team just gave it to me straight .
They said , Lewis , you need to have a radical tactical shift if you want to do this swim .
Every single thing which you have learned in the past 23 years of swimming , you must forget .
Every single thing which you learned when you were serving in the British army , about speed and aggression , you put that to one side .
We want you to walk up the hill in another two days &apos; time .
Take some time to rest and think about things .
We want you to walk up the mountain in two days &apos; time , and instead of swimming fast , swim as slowly as possible .
Instead of swimming crawl , swim breaststroke .
And remember , never ever swim with aggression .
This is the time to swim with real humility .
And so we walked back up to the mountain two days later .
And I stood there on the edge of the lake , and I looked up at Mt . Everest -- and she is one of the most beautiful mountains on the earth -- and I said to myself , just do this slowly .
And I swam across the lake .
And I can &apos;t begin to tell you how good I felt when I came to the other side .
But I learned two very , very important lessons there on Mt . Everest , and I thank my team of Sherpas who taught me this .
The first one is that just because something has worked in the past so well , doesn &apos;t mean it &apos;s going to work in the future .
And similarly , now , before I do anything , I ask myself what type of mindset do I require to successfully complete a task .
And taking that into the world of climate change -- which is , frankly , the Mt . Everest of all problems -- just because we &apos;ve lived the way we have lived for so long , and populated the earth the way we have for so long , doesn &apos;t mean that we can carry on the way we are carrying on .
The warning signs are all there .
When I was born , the world &apos;s population was 3.5 billion people .
We &apos;re now 6.8 billion people , and we &apos;re expected to be 9 billion people by 2050 .
And then the second lesson , the radical , tactical shift .
And I &apos;ve come here to ask you today : what radical tactical shift can you take in your relationship to the environment , which will ensure that our children and our grandchildren live in a safe world and a secure world , and most importantly , in a sustainable world ?
And I ask you , please , to go away from here and think about that one radical tactical shift which you could make , which will make that big difference , and then commit a hundred percent to doing it .
Blog about it , tweet about it , talk about it , and commit a hundred percent , because very , very few things are impossible to achieve if we really put our whole minds to it .
So thank you very , very much .
John Hodgman : Design , explained .
John Hodgman , comedian and resident expert , &quot; explains &quot; the design of three iconic modern objects . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Today I &apos;m going to unpack for you three examples of iconic design , and it makes perfect sense that I should be the one to do it because I have a Bachelor &apos;s degree in Literature .
But I &apos;m also a famous minor television personality and an avid collector of Design Within Reach catalogs , so I pretty much know everything there is .
Now , I &apos;m sure you recognize this object ; many of you probably saw it as you were landing your private zeppelins at Los Angeles International Airport over the past couple of days .
This is known as the Theme Building ; that is its name for reasons that are still very murky .
And it is perhaps the best example we have in Los Angeles of ancient extraterrestrial architecture .
It was first excavated in 1961 as they were building LAX , although scientists believe that it dates back to the year 2000 Before Common Era , when it was used as a busy transdimensional space port by the ancient astronauts who first colonized this planet and raised our species from savagery by giving us the gift of written language and technology and the gift of revolving restaurants .
It is thought to have been a replacement for the older space ports located , of course , at Stonehenge and considered to be quite an improvement due to the uncluttered design , the lack of druids hanging around all the time and obviously , the much better access to parking .
When it was uncovered , it ushered in a new era of streamlined , archaically futuristic design called Googie , which came to be synonymous with the Jet Age , a misnomer .
After all , the ancient astronauts who used it did not travel by jet very often , preferring instead to travel by feathered serpent powered by crystal skulls .
Ah yes , a table .
We use these every day .
And on top of it , the juicy salif .
This is a design by Philippe Starck , who I believe is in the audience at this very moment .
And you can tell it is a Starck design by its precision , its playfulness , its innovation and its promise of imminent violence .
It is a design that challenges your intuition -- it is not what you think it is when you first see it .
It is not a fork designed to grab three hors d &apos;oeuvres at a time , which would be useful out in the lobby , I would say .
And despite its obvious influence by the ancient astronauts and its space agey-ness and tripodism , it is not something designed to attach to your brain and suck out your thoughts .
It is in fact a citrus juicer and when I say that , you never see it as anything else again .
It is also not a monument to design , it is a monument to design &apos;s utility .
You can take it home with you , unlike the Theme Building , which will stay where it is forever .
This is affordable and can come home with you and , as such , it can sit on your kitchen counter -- it can &apos;t go in your drawers ; trust me , I found that out the hard way -- and make your kitchen counter into a monument to design .
One other thing about it , if you do have one at home , let me tell you one of the features you may not know : when you fall asleep , it comes alive and it walks around your house and goes through your mail and watches you as you sleep .
Okay , what is this object ?
I have no idea . I don &apos;t know what that thing is .
It looks terrible . Is it a little hot plate ?
I don &apos;t get it .
Does anyone know ? Chi ?
It &apos;s an ... iPhone. iPhone .
Oh yes , that &apos;s right , I remember those ; I had my whole bathroom tiles redone with those back in the good old days .
No , I have an iPhone . Of course I do .
Here is my well-loved iPhone .
I do so many things on this little device .
I like to read books on it .
More than that , I like to buy books on it that I never have to feel guilty about not reading because they go in here and I never look at them again and it &apos;s perfect .
I use it every day to measure the weight of an ox , for example .
Every now and then , I admit that I complete a phone call on it occasionally .
And yet I forget about it all the time .
This is a design that once you saw it , you forgot about it .
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life .
Unlike the Theme Building , this is not alien technology .
Or I should say , what it did was it took technology which , unlike people in this room , to many other people in the world , still feels very alien , and made it immediately and instantly feel familiar and intimate .
And unlike the juicy salif , it does not threaten to attach itself to your brain , rather , it simply attaches itself to your brain .
And you didn &apos;t even notice it happened .
So there you go . My name is John Hodgman .
I just explained design .

Lakshmi Pratury : The lost art of letter-writing
Lakshmi Pratury remembers the lost art of letter-writing and shares a series of notes her father wrote to her before he died . Her short but heartfelt talk may inspire you to set pen to paper , too .
So I thought , &quot; I will talk about death . &quot;
Seemed to be the passion today .
Actually , it &apos;s not about death .
It &apos;s inevitable , terrible , but really what I want to talk about is , I &apos;m just fascinated by the legacy people leave when they die .
That &apos;s what I want to talk about .
So Art Buchwald left his legacy of humor with a video that appeared soon after he died , saying , &quot; Hi ! I &apos;m Art Buchwald , and I just died . &quot;
And Mike , who I met at Galapagos , a trip which I won at TED , is leaving notes on cyberspace where he is chronicling his journey through cancer .
And my father left me a legacy of his handwriting through letters and a notebook .
In the last two years of his life , when he was sick , he filled a notebook with his thoughts about me .
He wrote about my strengths , weaknesses , and gentle suggestions for improvement , quoting specific incidents , and held a mirror to my life .
After he died , I realized that no one writes to me anymore .
Handwriting is a disappearing art .
I &apos;m all for email and thinking while typing , but why give up old habits for new ?
Why can &apos;t we have letter writing and email exchange in our lives ?
There are times when I want to trade all those years that I was too busy to sit with my dad and chat with him , and trade all those years for one hug .
But too late .
But that &apos;s when I take out his letters and I read them , and the paper that touched his hand is in mine , and I feel connected to him .
So maybe we all need to leave our children with a value legacy , and not a financial one .
A value for things with a personal touch -- an autograph book , a soul-searching letter .
If a fraction of this powerful TED audience could be inspired to buy a beautiful paper -- John , it &apos;ll be a recycled one -- and write a beautiful letter to someone they love , we actually may start a revolution where our children may go to penmanship classes .
So what do I plan to leave for my son ?
I collect autograph books , and those of you authors in the audience know I hound you for them -- and CDs too , Tracy .
I plan to publish my own notebook .
As I witnessed my father &apos;s body being swallowed by fire , I sat by his funeral pyre and wrote .
I have no idea how I &apos;m going to do it , but I am committed to compiling his thoughts and mine into a book , and leave that published book for my son .
I &apos;d like to end with a few verses of what I wrote at my father &apos;s cremation .
And those linguists , please pardon the grammar , because I &apos;ve not looked at it in the last 10 years .
I took it out for the first time to come here .
&quot; Picture in a frame , ashes in a bottle , boundless energy confined in the bottle , forcing me to deal with reality , forcing me to deal with being grown up .
I hear you and I know that you would want me to be strong , but right now , I am being sucked down , surrounded and suffocated by these raging emotional waters , craving to cleanse my soul , trying to emerge on a firm footing one more time , to keep on fighting and flourishing just as you taught me .
Your encouraging whispers in my whirlpool of despair , holding me and heaving me to shores of sanity , to live again and to love again . &quot;
Thank you .
Sergey Brin : Why Google Glass ?
It &apos;s not a demo , more of a philosophical argument : Why did Sergey Brin and his team at Google want to build an eye-mounted camera / computer , codenamed Glass ? Onstage at TED2013 , Brin calls for a new way of seeing our relationship with our mobile computers -- not hunched over a screen but meeting the world heads-up .
Okay , it &apos;s great to be back at TED .
Why don &apos;t I just start by firing away with the video ?
Okay , Glass , record a video .
This is it . We &apos;re on in two minutes .
Okay Glass , hang out with The Flying Club .
Google &quot; photos of tiger heads . &quot; Hmm .
You ready ? You ready ?
Right there . Okay , Glass , take a picture .
Go !
Man 6 : Holy &#91; beep &#93; ! That is awesome .
Whoa ! Look at that snake !
Woman 3 : Okay , Glass , record a video !
Man 7 : After this bridge , first exit .
Man 8 : Okay , A12 , right there !
Man 9 : Google , say &quot; delicious &quot; in Thai .
Google Glass : ‡∏≠‡∏£ ‡πà ‡∏≠‡∏¢Man 9 : Mmm , ‡∏≠‡∏£ ‡πà ‡∏≠‡∏¢ .
Woman 4 : Google &quot; jellyfish . &quot;
Man 10 : It &apos;s beautiful .
Sergey Brin : Oh , sorry , I just got this message from a Nigerian prince .
He needs help getting 10 million dollars .
I like to pay attention to these because that &apos;s how we originally funded the company , and it &apos;s gone pretty well .
Though in all seriousness , this position that you just saw me in , looking down at my phone , that &apos;s one of the reasons behind this project , Project Glass .
Because we ultimately questioned whether this is the ultimate future of how you want to connect to other people in your life , how you want to connect to information .
Should it be by just walking around looking down ?
But that was the vision behind Glass , and that &apos;s why we &apos;ve created this form factor .
Okay . And I don &apos;t want to go through all the things it does and whatnot , but I want to tell you a little bit more about the motivation behind what led to it .
In addition to potentially socially isolating yourself when you &apos;re out and about looking at your phone , it &apos;s kind of , is this what you &apos;re meant to do with your body ?
You &apos;re standing around there and you &apos;re just rubbing this featureless piece of glass .
You &apos;re just kind of moving around .
So when we developed Glass , we thought really about , can we make something that frees your hands ?
You saw all of the things people are doing in the video back there .
They were all wearing Glass , and that &apos;s how we got that footage .
And also you want something that frees your eyes .
That &apos;s why we put the display up high , out of your line of sight , so it wouldn &apos;t be where you &apos;re looking and it wouldn &apos;t be where you &apos;re making eye contact with people .
And also we wanted to free up the ears , so the sound actually goes through , conducts straight to the bones in your cranium , which is a little bit freaky at first , but you get used to it .
And ironically , if you want to hear it better , you actually just cover your ear , which is kind of surprising , but that &apos;s how it works .
My vision when we started Google 15 years ago was that eventually you wouldn &apos;t have to have a search query at all .
You &apos;d just have information come to you as you needed it .
And this is now , 15 years later , sort of the first form factor that I think can deliver that vision when you &apos;re out and about on the street talking to people and so forth .
This project has lasted now , been just over two years .
We &apos;ve learned an amazing amount .
It &apos;s been really important to make it comfortable .
So our first prototypes we built were huge .
It was like cell phones strapped to your head .
It was very heavy , pretty uncomfortable .
We had to keep it secret from our industrial designer until she actually accepted the job , and then she almost ran away screaming .
But we &apos;ve come a long way .
And the other really unexpected surprise was the camera .
Our original prototypes didn &apos;t have cameras at all , but it &apos;s been really magical to be able to capture moments spent with my family , my kids .
I just never would have dug out a camera or a phone or something else to take that moment .
And lastly I &apos;ve realized , in experimenting with this device , that I also kind of have a nervous tic .
The cell phone is -- yeah , you have to look down on it and all that , but it &apos;s also kind of a nervous habit .
Like if I smoked , I &apos;d probably just smoke instead .
I would just light up a cigarette . It would look cooler .
You know , I &apos;d be like -- But in this case , you know , I whip this out and I sit there and look as if I have something very important to do or attend to .
But it really opened my eyes to how much of my life I spent just secluding away , be it email or social posts or whatnot , even though it wasn &apos;t really -- there &apos;s nothing really that important or that pressing .
And with this , I know I will get certain messages if I really need them , but I don &apos;t have to be checking them all the time .
Yeah , I &apos;ve really enjoyed actually exploring the world more , doing more of the crazy things like you saw in the video .
Thank you all very much .
Bren√© Brown : Listening to shame
Shame is an unspoken epidemic , the secret behind many forms of broken behavior . Bren√© Brown , whose earlier talk on vulnerability became a viral hit , explores what can happen when people confront their shame head-on . Her own humor , humanity and vulnerability shine through every word .
I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about my TEDxHouston Talk .
I woke up the morning after I gave that Talk with the worst vulnerability hangover of my life .
And I actually didn &apos;t leave my house for about three days .
The first time I left was to meet a friend for lunch .
And when I walked in , she was already at the table .
And I sat down , and she said , &quot; God , you look like hell . &quot;
I said , &quot; Thanks . I feel really -- I &apos;m not functioning . &quot;
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I just told 500 people that I became a researcher to avoid vulnerability .
And that when being vulnerable emerged from my data , as absolutely essential to whole-hearted living , I told these 500 people that I had a breakdown .
I had a slide that said Breakdown .
At what point did I think that was a good idea ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; I saw your Talk live-streamed .
It was not really you .
It was a little different than what you usually do .
But it was great . &quot;
And I said , &quot; This can &apos;t happen .
YouTube , they &apos;re putting this thing on YouTube .
And we &apos;re going to be talking about 600 , 700 people . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Well , I think it &apos;s too late . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Let me ask you something . &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Do you remember when we were in college and really wild and kind of dumb ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Remember when we &apos;d leave a really bad message on our ex-boyfriend &apos;s answering machine ?
Then we &apos;d have to break into his dorm room and then erase the tape ? &quot;
And she goes , &quot; Uh ... no . &quot;
So of course , the only thing I could think of to say at that point was , &quot; Yeah , me neither .
That ... me neither . &quot;
And I &apos;m thinking to myself , &quot; Brene , what are you doing ? What are you doing ?
Why did you bring this up ? Have you lost your mind ?
Your sisters would be perfect for this . &quot;
So I looked back up and she said , &quot; Are you really going to try to break in and steal the video before they put it on YouTube ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; I &apos;m just thinking about it a little bit . &quot;
She said , &quot; You &apos;re like the worst vulnerability role model ever . &quot;
And then I looked at her and I said something that at the time felt a little dramatic , but ended up being more prophetic than dramatic .
I said , &quot; If 500 turns into 1,000 or 2,000 , my life is over . &quot;
I had no contingency plan for four million .
And my life did end when that happened .
And maybe the hardest part about my life ending is that I learned something hard about myself , and that was that , as much as I would frustrated about not being able to get my work out to the world , there was a part of me that was working very hard to engineer staying small , staying right under the radar .
But I want to talk about what I &apos;ve learned .
There &apos;s two things that I &apos;ve learned in the last year .
The first is vulnerability is not weakness .
And that myth is profoundly dangerous .
Let me ask you honestly -- and I &apos;ll give you this warning , I &apos;m trained as a therapist , so I can out-wait you uncomfortably -- so if you could just raise your hand that would be awesome -- how many of you honestly , when you &apos;re thinking about doing something vulnerable or saying something vulnerable , think , &quot; God , vulnerability &apos;s weakness . This is weakness ? &quot;
How many of you think of vulnerability and weakness synonymously ?
The majority of people .
Now let me ask you this question : This past week at TED , how many of you , when you saw vulnerability up here , thought it was pure courage ?
Vulnerability is not weakness .
I define vulnerability as emotional risk , exposure , uncertainty .
It fuels our daily lives .
And I &apos;ve come to the belief -- this is my 12th year doing this research -- that vulnerability is our most accurate measurement of courage -- to be vulnerable , to let ourselves be seen , to be honest .
One of the weird things that &apos;s happened is , after the TED explosion , I got a lot of offers to speak all over the country -- everyone from schools and parent meetings to Fortune 500 companies .
And so many of the calls went like this , &quot; Hey , Dr. Brown . We loved your TEDTalk .
We &apos;d like you to come in and speak .
We &apos;d appreciate it if you wouldn &apos;t mention vulnerability or shame . &quot;
What would you like for me to talk about ?
There &apos;s three big answers .
This is mostly , to be honest with you , from the business sector : innovation , creativity and change .
So let me go on the record and say , vulnerability is the birthplace of innovation , creativity and change .
To create is to make something that has never existed before .
There &apos;s nothing more vulnerable than that .
Adaptability to change is all about vulnerability .
The second thing , in addition to really finally understanding the relationship between vulnerability and courage , the second thing I learned is this : We have to talk about shame .
And I &apos;m going to be really honest with you .
When I became a &quot; vulnerability researcher &quot; and that became the focus because of the TEDTalk -- and I &apos;m not kidding .
I &apos;ll give you an example .
About three months ago , I was in a sporting goods store buying goggles and shin guards and all the things that parents buy at the sporting goods store .
About from a hundred feet away , this is what I hear : &quot; Vulnerability TED ! Vulnerability TED ! &quot;
I &apos;m a fifth generation Texan .
Our family motto is &quot; Lock and load . &quot;
I am not a natural vulnerability researcher .
So I &apos;m like , just keep walking , she &apos;s on my six .
And then I hear , &quot; Vulnerability TED ! &quot;
I turn around , I go , &quot; Hi . &quot;
She &apos;s right here and she said , &quot; You &apos;re the shame researcher who had the breakdown . &quot;
At this point parents are , like , pulling their children close .
&quot; Look away . &quot;
And I &apos;m so worn out at this point in my life , I look at her and I actually say , &quot; It was a frickin &apos; spiritual awakening . &quot;
And she looks back and does this , &quot; I know . &quot;
And she said , &quot; We watched your TEDTalk in my book club .
Then we read your book and we renamed ourselves &apos; The Breakdown Babes . &apos; &quot; And she said , &quot; Our tagline is : &apos; We &apos;re falling apart and it feels fantastic . &apos; &quot; You can only imagine what it &apos;s like for me in a faculty meeting .
So when I became Vulnerability TED , like an action figure -- like Ninja Barbie , but I &apos;m Vulnerability TED -- I thought , I &apos;m going to leave that shame stuff behind , because I spent six years studying shame before I really started writing and talking about vulnerability .
And I thought , thank God , because shame is this horrible topic , no one wants to talk about it .
It &apos;s the best way to shut people down on an airplane .
&quot; What do you do ? &quot; &quot; I study shame . &quot; &quot; Oh . &quot;
And I see you .
But in surviving this last year , I was reminded of a cardinal rule -- not a research rule , but a moral imperative from my upbringing -- you &apos;ve got to dance with the one who brung ya .
And I did not learn about vulnerability and courage and creativity and innovation from studying vulnerability .
I learned about these things from studying shame .
And so I want to walk you in to shame .
Jungian analysts call shame the swampland of the soul .
And we &apos;re going to walk in .
And the purpose is not to walk in and construct a home and live there .
It is to put on some galoshes and walk through and find our way around .
Here &apos;s why .
We heard the most compelling call ever to have a conversation in this country , and I think globally , around race , right ?
Yes ? We heard that .
Yes ?
Cannot have that conversation without shame , because you cannot talk about race without talking about privilege .
And when people start talking about privilege , they get paralyzed by shame .
We heard a brilliant simple solution to not killing people in surgery , which is have a checklist .
You can &apos;t fix that problem without addressing shame , because when they teach those folks how to suture , they also teach them how to stitch their self-worth to being all-powerful .
And all-powerful folks don &apos;t need checklists .
And I had to write down the name of this TED Fellow so I didn &apos;t mess it up here .
Myshkin Ingawale , I hope I did right by you .
I saw the TED Fellows my first day here .
And he got up and he explained how he was driven to create some technology to help test for anemia because people were dying unnecessarily .
And he said , &quot; I saw this need .
So you know what I did ? I made it . &quot;
And everybody just burst into applause , and they were like &quot; Yes ! &quot;
And he said , &quot; And it didn &apos;t work .
And then I made it 32 more times , and then it worked . &quot;
You know what the big secret about TED is ?
I can &apos;t wait to tell people this .
I guess I &apos;m doing it right now .
This is like the failure conference .
No , it is .
You know why this place is amazing ?
Because very few people here are afraid to fail .
And no one who gets on the stage , so far that I &apos;ve seen , has not failed .
I &apos;ve failed miserably , many times .
I don &apos;t think the world understands that because of shame .
There &apos;s a great quote that saved me this past year by Theodore Roosevelt .
A lot of people refer to it as the &quot; Man in the Arena &quot; quote .
And it goes like this : &quot; It is not the critic who counts .
It is not the man who sits and points out how the doer of deeds could have done things better and how he falls and stumbles .
The credit goes to the man in the arena whose face is marred with dust and blood and sweat .
But when he &apos;s in the arena , at best he wins , and at worst he loses , but when he fails , when he loses , he does so daring greatly . &quot;
And that &apos;s what this conference , to me , is about .
That &apos;s what life is about , about daring greatly , about being in the arena .
When you walk up to that arena and you put your hand on the door , and you think , &quot; I &apos;m going in and I &apos;m going to try this , &quot; shame is the gremlin who says , &quot; Uh , uh .
You &apos;re not good enough .
You never finished that MBA . Your wife left you .
I know your dad really wasn &apos;t in Luxembourg , he was in Sing Sing .
I know those things that happened to you growing up .
I know you don &apos;t think that you &apos;re pretty enough or smart enough or talented enough or powerful enough .
I know your dad never paid attention , even when you made CFO . &quot;
Shame is that thing .
And if we can quiet it down and walk in and say , &quot; I &apos;m going to do this , &quot; we look up and the critic that we see pointing and laughing , 99 percent of the time is who ?
Us .
Shame drives two big tapes -- &quot; never good enough &quot; and , if you can talk it out of that one , &quot; who do you think you are ? &quot;
The thing to understand about shame is it &apos;s not guilt .
Shame is a focus on self , guilt is a focus on behavior .
Shame is &quot; I am bad . &quot;
Guilt is &quot; I did something bad . &quot;
How many of you , if you did something that was hurtful to me , would be willing to say , &quot; I &apos;m sorry . I made a mistake ? &quot;
How many of you would be willing to say that ?
Guilt : I &apos;m sorry . I made a mistake .
Shame : I &apos;m sorry . I am a mistake .
There &apos;s a huge difference between shame and guilt .
And here &apos;s what you need to know .
Shame is highly , highly correlated with addiction , depression , violence , aggression , bullying , suicide , eating disorders .
And here &apos;s what you even need to know more .
Guilt , inversely correlated with those things .
The ability to hold something we &apos;ve done or failed to do up against who we want to be is incredibly adaptive .
It &apos;s uncomfortable , but it &apos;s adaptive .
The other thing you need to know about shame is it &apos;s absolutely organized by gender .
If shame washes over me and washes over Chris , it &apos;s going to feel the same .
Everyone sitting in here knows the warm wash of shame .
We &apos;re pretty sure that the only people who don &apos;t experience shame are people who have no capacity for connection or empathy .
Which means , yes , I have a little shame ; no , I &apos;m a sociopath .
So I would opt for , yes , you have a little shame .
Shame feels the same for men and women , but it &apos;s organized by gender .
For women , the best example I can give you is Enjoli the commercial : &quot; I can put the wash on the line , pack the lunches , hand out the kisses and be at work at five to nine .
I can bring home the bacon , fry it up in the pan and never let you forget you &apos;re a man . &quot;
For women , shame is do it all , do it perfectly and never let them see you sweat .
I don &apos;t know how much perfume that commercial sold , but I guarantee you , it moved a lot of antidepressants and anti-anxiety meds .
Shame , for women , is this web of unobtainable , conflicting , competing expectations about who we &apos;re supposed to be .
And it &apos;s a straight-jacket .
For men , shame is not a bunch of competing , conflicting expectations .
Shame is one , do not be perceived as what ?
Weak .
I did not interview men for the first four years of my study .
And it wasn &apos;t until a man looked at me one day after a book signing , said , &quot; I love what you have to say about shame , I &apos;m curious why you didn &apos;t mention men . &quot;
And I said , &quot; I don &apos;t study men . &quot;
And he said , &quot; That &apos;s convenient . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Why ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Because you say to reach out , tell our story , be vulnerable .
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yeah . &quot;
&quot; They &apos;d rather me die on top of my white horse than watch me fall down .
When we reach out and be vulnerable we get the shit beat out of us .
And don &apos;t tell me it &apos;s from the guys and the coaches and the dads , because the women in my life are harder on me than anyone else . &quot;
So I started interviewing men and asking questions .
And what I learned is this : You show me a woman who can actually sit with a man in real vulnerability and fear , I &apos;ll show you a woman who &apos;s done incredible work .
You show me a man who can sit with a woman who &apos;s just had it , she can &apos;t do it all anymore , and his first response is not , &quot; I unloaded the dishwasher , &quot; but he really listens -- because that &apos;s all we need -- I &apos;ll show you a guy who &apos;s done a lot of work .
Shame is an epidemic in our culture .
And to get out from underneath it , to find our way back to each other , we have to understand how it affects us and how it affects the way we &apos;re parenting , the way we &apos;re working , the way we &apos;re looking at each other .
Very quickly , some research by Mahalik at Boston College .
He asked , what do women need to do to conform to female norms ?
The top answers in this country : nice , thin , modest and use all available resources for appearance .
When he asked about men , what do men in this country need to do to conform with male norms , the answers were : always show emotional control , work is first , pursue status and violence .
If we &apos;re going to find our way back to each other , we have to understand and know empathy , because empathy &apos;s the antidote to shame .
If you put shame in a Petri dish , it needs three things to grow exponentially : secrecy , silence and judgment .
If you put the same amount of shame in a Petri dish and douse it with empathy , it can &apos;t survive .
The two most powerful words when we &apos;re in struggle : me too .
And so I &apos;ll leave you with this thought .
If we &apos;re going to find our way back to each other , vulnerability is going to be that path .
And I know it &apos;s seductive to stand outside the arena , because I think I did it my whole life , and think to myself , I &apos;m going to go in there and kick some ass when I &apos;m bulletproof and when I &apos;m perfect .
And that is seductive .
But the truth is that never happens .
And even if you got as perfect as you could and as bulletproof as you could possibly muster when you got in there , that &apos;s not what we want to see .
We want you to go in .
We want to be with you and across from you .
And we just want , for ourselves and the people we care about and the people we work with , to dare greatly .
So thank you all very much . I really appreciate it .
Eric Whitacre : Virtual Choir Live
Composer and conductor Eric Whitacre has inspired millions by bringing together &quot; virtual choirs , &quot; singers from many countries spliced together on video . Now , for the first time ever , he creates the experience in real time , as 32 singers from around the world Skype in to join an onstage choir for an epic performance of Whitacre &apos;s &quot; Cloudburst , &quot; based on a poem by Octavio Paz .
In 1991 I had maybe the most profound and transformative experience of my life .
I was in the third year of my seven-year undergraduate degree .
I took a couple victory laps in there .
And I was on a college choir tour up in Northern California , and we had stopped for the day after all day on the bus , and we were relaxing next to this beautiful idyllic lake in the mountains .
And there were crickets and birds and frogs making noise , and as we sat there , over the mountains coming in from the north were these Steven Spielbergian clouds rolling toward us , and as the clouds got about halfway over the valley , so help me God , every single animal in that place stopped making noise at the same time .
This electric hush , as if they could sense what was about to happen .
And then the clouds came over us , and then , boom ! This massive thunderclap , and sheets of rain .
It was just extraordinary , and when I came back home I found a poem by the Mexican poet Octavio Paz , and decided to set it to music , a piece for choir called &quot; Cloudburst , &quot; which is the piece that we &apos;ll perform for you in just a moment .
Now fast forward to just three years ago .
And we released to YouTube this , the Virtual Choir Project , 185 singers from 12 different countries .
You can see my little video there conducting these people , alone in their dorm rooms or in their living rooms at home .
Two years ago , on this very stage , we premiered Virtual Choir 2 , 2,052 singers from 58 different countries , this time performing a piece that I had written called &quot; Sleep . &quot;
And then just last spring we released Virtual Choir 3 , &quot; Water Night , &quot; another piece that I had written , this time nearly 4,000 singers from 73 different countries .
And when I was speaking to Chris about the future of Virtual Choir and where we might be able to take this , he challenged me to push the technology as far as we possibly could .
Could we do this all in real time ?
Could we have people singing together in real time ?
And with the help of Skype , that is what we are going to attempt today .
Now , we &apos;ll perform &quot; Cloudburst &quot; for you .
The first half will be performed by the live singers here on stage .
I &apos;m joined by singers from Cal State Long Beach , Cal State Fullerton and Riverside Community College , some of the best amateur choirs in the country , and ‚Äî -- and in the second half of the piece , the virtual choir will join us , 30 different singers from 30 different countries .
Now , we &apos;ve pushed the technology as far as it can go , but there &apos;s still less than a second of latency , but in musical terms , that &apos;s a lifetime .
We deal in milliseconds .

Laura Trice : Remember to say thank you
In this deceptively simple 3-minute talk , Dr. Laura Trice muses on the power of the magic words &quot; thank you &quot; -- to deepen a friendship , to repair a bond , to make sure another person knows what they mean to you . Try it .
Hi . I &apos;m here to talk to you about the importance of praise , admiration and thank you , and having it be specific and genuine .
And the way I got interested in this was , I noticed in myself , when I was growing up , and until about a few years ago , that I would want to say thank you to someone , I would want to praise them , I would want to take in their praise of me and I &apos;d just stop it .
And I asked myself , why ?
I felt shy , I felt embarrassed .
And then my question became , am I the only one who does this ?
So , I decided to investigate .
I &apos;m fortunate enough to work in the rehab facility , so I get to see people who are facing life and death with addiction .
And sometimes it comes down to something as simple as , their core wound is their father died without ever saying he &apos;s proud of them .
But then , they hear from all the family and friends that the father told everybody else that he was proud of him , but he never told the son .
It &apos;s because he didn &apos;t know that his son needed to hear it .
So my question is , why don &apos;t we ask for the things that we need ?
I know a gentleman , married for 25 years , who &apos;s longing to hear his wife say , &quot; Thank you for being the breadwinner , so I can stay home with the kids , &quot; but won &apos;t ask .
I know a woman who &apos;s good at this .
She , once a week , meets with her husband and says , &quot; I &apos;d really like you to thank me for all these things I did in the house and with the kids . &quot;
And he goes , &quot; Oh , this is great , this is great . &quot;
And praise really does have to be genuine , but she takes responsibility for that .
And a friend of mine , April , who I &apos;ve had since kindergarten , she thanks her children for doing their chores .
And she said , &quot; Why wouldn &apos;t I thank it , even though they &apos;re supposed to do it ? &quot;
So , the question is , why was I blocking it ?
Why were other people blocking it ?
Why can I say , &quot; I &apos;ll take my steak medium rare , I need size six shoes , &quot; but I won &apos;t say , &quot; Would you praise me this way ? &quot;
And it &apos;s because I &apos;m giving you critical data about me .
I &apos;m telling you where I &apos;m insecure .
I &apos;m telling you where I need your help .
And I &apos;m treating you , my inner circle , like you &apos;re the enemy .
Because what can you do with that data ?
You could neglect me .
You could abuse it .
Or you could actually meet my need .
And I took my bike into the bike store-- I love this -- same bike , and they &apos;d do something called &quot; truing &quot; the wheels .
The guy said , &quot; You know , when you true the wheels , it &apos;s going to make the bike so much better . &quot;
I get the same bike back , and they &apos;ve taken all the little warps out of those same wheels I &apos;ve had for two and a half years , and my bike is like new .
So , I &apos;m going to challenge all of you .
I want you to true your wheels : be honest about the praise that you need to hear .
What do you need to hear ? Go home to your wife -- go ask her , what does she need ?
Go home to your husband -- what does he need ?
Go home and ask those questions , and then help the people around you .
And it &apos;s simple .
And why should we care about this ?
We talk about world peace .
How can we have world peace with different cultures , different languages ?
I think it starts household by household , under the same roof .
So , let &apos;s make it right in our own backyard .
And I want to thank all of you in the audience for being great husbands , great mothers , friends , daughters , sons .
And maybe somebody &apos;s never said that to you , but you &apos;ve done a really , really good job .
And thank you for being here , just showing up and changing the world with your ideas .
Thank you .
Carter Emmart : A 3D atlas of the universe
For the last 12 years , Carter Emmart has been coordinating the efforts of scientists , artists and programmers to build a complete 3D visualization of our known universe . He demos this stunning tour and explains how it &apos;s being shared with facilities around the world .
It &apos;s a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe , which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe .
And so I think we can roll the video that we have .
&#91; The Himalayas . &#93; The flat horizon that we &apos;ve evolved with has been a metaphor for the infinite : unbounded resources and unlimited capacity for disposal of waste .
It wasn &apos;t until we really left Earth , got above the atmosphere and had seen the horizon bend back on itself , that we could understand our planet as a limited condition .
The Digital Universe Atlas has been built at the American Museum of Natural History over the past 12 years .
We maintain that , put that together as a project to really chart the universe across all scales .
What we see here are satellites around the Earth and the Earth in proper registration against the universe , as we see .
NASA supported this work 12 years ago as part of the rebuilding of the Hayden Planetarium so that we would share this with the world .
The Digital Universe is the basis of our space show productions that we do -- our main space shows in the dome .
But what you see here is the result of , actually , internships that we hosted with Linkoping University in Sweden .
I &apos;ve had 12 students work on this for their graduate work , and the result has been this software called Uniview and a company called SCISS in Sweden .
This software allows interactive use , so this actual flight path and movie that we see here was actually flown live .
I captured this live from my laptop in a cafe called Earth Matters on the Lower East Side of Manhattan , where I live , and it was done as a collaborative project with the Rubin Museum of Himalayan Art for an exhibit on comparative cosmology .
And so as we move out , we see continuously from our planet all the way out into the realm of galaxies , as we see here , light-travel time , giving you a sense of how far away we are .
As we move out , the light from these distant galaxies have taken so long , we &apos;re essentially backing up into the past .
We back so far up we &apos;re finally seeing a containment around us -- the afterglow of the Big Bang .
This is the WMAP microwave background that we see .
We &apos;ll fly outside it here , just to see this sort of containment .
If we were outside this , it would almost be meaningless , in the sense as before time .
But this our containment of the visible universe .
We know the universe is bigger than that which we can see .
Coming back quickly , we see here the radio sphere that we jumped out of in the beginning , but these are positions , the latest positions of exoplanets that we &apos;ve mapped , and our sun here , obviously , with our own solar system .
What you &apos;re going to see -- we &apos;re going to have to jump in here pretty quickly between several orders of magnitude to get down to where we see the solar system -- these are the paths of Voyager 1 , Voyager 2 , Pioneer 11 and Pioneer 10 , the first four spacecraft to have left the solar system .
Coming in closer , picking up Earth , orbit of the Moon , and we see the Earth .
This map can be updated , and we can add in new data .
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
for the Cassini mission .
But here we see the complex trajectory of the Cassini mission color coded for different mission phases , ingeniously developed so that 45 encounters with the largest moon , Titan , which is larger that the planet Mercury , diverts the orbit into different parts of mission phase .
This software allows us to come close and look at parts of this .
This software can also be networked between domes .
We have a growing user base of this , and we network domes .
And we can network between domes and classrooms .
We &apos;re actually sharing tours of the universe with the first sub-Saharan planetarium in Ghana as well as new libraries that have been built in the ghettos in Columbia and a high school in Cambodia .
And the Cambodians have actually controlled the Hayden Planetarium from their high school .
This is an image from Saturday , photographed by the Aqua satellite , but through the Uniview software .
So you &apos;re seeing the edge of the Earth .
This is Nepal .
This is , in fact , right here is the valley of Lhasa , right here in Tibet .
But we can see the haze from fires and so forth in the Ganges valley down below in India .
This is Nepal and Tibet .
And just in closing , I &apos;d just like to say this beautiful world that we live on -- here we see a bit of the snow so I &apos;d like to just say that what the world needs now is a sense of being able to look at ourselves in this much larger condition now and a much larger sense of what home is .
Because our home is the universe , and we are the universe , essentially .
We carry that in us .
And to be able to see our context in this larger sense at all scales helps us all , I think , in understanding where we are and who we are in the universe .
Thank you .
Esther Perel : The secret to desire in a long-term relationship
In long-term relationships , we often expect our beloved to be both best friend and erotic partner . But as Esther Perel argues , good &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; and &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ; committed sex draws on two conflicting needs : our need for security and our need for surprise . So how do you sustain desire ? With wit and eloquence , Perel lets us in on the mystery of erotic intelligence .
So , why does good sex so often fade , even for couples who continue to love each other as much as ever ?
And why does good intimacy not guarantee good sex , contrary to popular belief ?
Or , the next question would be , can we want what we already have ?
That &apos;s the million-dollar question , right ?
And why is the forbidden so erotic ?
What is it about transgression that makes desire so potent ?
And why does sex make babies , and babies spell erotic disaster in couples ?
It &apos;s kind of the fatal erotic blow , isn &apos;t it ?
And when you love , how does it feel ?
And when you desire , how is it different ?
These are some of the questions that are at the center of my exploration on the nature of erotic desire and its concomitant dilemmas in modern love .
So I travel the globe , and what I &apos;m noticing is that everywhere where romanticism has entered , there seems to be a crisis of desire .
A crisis of desire , as in owning the wanting -- desire as an expression of our individuality , of our free choice , of our preferences , of our identity -- desire that has become a central concept as part of modern love and individualistic societies .
You know , this is the first time in the history of humankind where we are trying to experience sexuality in the long term , not because we want 14 children , for which we need to have even more because many of them won &apos;t make it , and not because it is exclusively a woman &apos;s marital duty .
This is the first time that we want sex over time about pleasure and connection that is rooted in desire .
So what sustains desire , and why is it so difficult ?
And at the heart of sustaining desire in a committed relationship , I think is the reconciliation of two fundamental human needs .
On the one hand , our need for security , for predictability , for safety , for dependability , for reliability , for permanence -- all these anchoring , grounding experiences of our lives that we call home .
But we also have an equally strong need -- men and women -- for adventure , for novelty , for mystery , for risk , for danger , for the unknown , for the unexpected , surprise -- you get the gist -- for journey , for travel .
So reconciling our need for security and our need for adventure into one relationship , or what we today like to call a passionate marriage , used to be a contradiction in terms .
Marriage was an economic institution in which you were given a partnership for life in terms of children and social status and succession and companionship .
But now we want our partner to still give us all these things , but in addition I want you to be my best friend and my trusted confidant and my passionate lover to boot , and we live twice as long .
So we come to one person , and we basically are asking them to give us what once an entire village used to provide : Give me belonging , give me identity , give me continuity , but give me transcendence and mystery and awe all in one .
Give me comfort , give me edge .
Give me novelty , give me familiarity .
Give me predictability , give me surprise .
So now we get to the existential reality of the story , right ?
Because I think , in some way -- and I &apos;ll come back to that -- but the crisis of desire is often a crisis of the imagination .
So why does good sex so often fade ?
What is the relationship between love and desire ?
How do they relate , and how do they conflict ?
Because therein lies the mystery of eroticism .
So if there is a verb , for me , that comes with love , it &apos;s &quot; to have . &quot;
And if there is a verb that comes with desire , it is &quot; to want . &quot;
In love , we want to have , we want to know the beloved .
We want to minimize the distance . We want to contract that gap .
We want to neutralize the tensions . We want closeness .
But in desire , we tend to not really want to go back to the places we &apos;ve already gone .
Forgone conclusion does not keep our interest .
In desire , we want an Other , somebody on the other side that we can go visit , that we can go spend some time with , that we can go see what goes on in their red light district .
In desire , we want a bridge to cross .
Or in other words , I sometimes say , fire needs air .
Desire needs space .
And when it &apos;s said like that , it &apos;s often quite abstract .
But then I took a question with me .
And I &apos;ve gone to more than 20 countries in the last few years with &quot; Mating in Captivity , &quot; and I asked people , when do you find yourself most drawn to your partner ?
Not attracted sexually , per se , but most drawn .
And across culture , across religion , and across gender -- except for one -- there are a few answers that just keep coming back .
So the first group is : I am most drawn to my partner when she is away , when we are apart , when we reunite .
Basically , when I get back in touch with my ability to imagine myself with my partner , when my imagination comes back in the picture , and when I can root it in absence and in longing , which is a major component of desire .
But then the second group is even more interesting : I am most drawn to my partner when I see him in the studio , when she is onstage , when he is in his element , when she &apos;s doing something she &apos;s passionate about , when I see him at a party and other people are really drawn to him , when I see her hold court .
Basically , when I look at my partner radiant and confident , probably the biggest turn-on across the board .
Radiant , as in self-sustaining .
I look at this person -- by the way , in desire people rarely talk about it , when we are blended into one , five centimeters from each other . I don &apos;t know in inches how much that is .
But it &apos;s also not when the other person is that far apart that you no longer see them .
It &apos;s when I &apos;m looking at my partner from a comfortable distance , where this person that is already so familiar , so known , is momentarily once again somewhat mysterious , somewhat elusive .
And in this space between me and the other lies the erotic √©lan , lies that movement toward the other .
Because sometimes , as Proust says , mystery is not about traveling to new places , but it &apos;s about looking with new eyes .
And so , when I see my partner on his own or her own , doing something in which they are enveloped , I look at this person and I momentarily get a shift in perception , and I stay open to the mysteries that are living right next to me .
And then , more importantly , in this description about the other or myself -- it &apos;s the same -- what is most interesting is that there is no neediness in desire .
Nobody needs anybody .
There is no caretaking in desire .
Caretaking is mightily loving . It &apos;s a powerful anti-aphrodisiac .
I have yet to see somebody who is so turned on by somebody who needs them .
Wanting them is one thing . Needing them is a shutdown , and women have known that forever , because anything that will bring up parenthood will usually decrease the erotic charge .
For good reasons , right ?
And then the third group of answers usually would be when I &apos;m surprised , when we laugh together , as somebody said to me in the office today , when he &apos;s in his tux , so I said , you know , it &apos;s either the tux or the cowboy boots .
But basically it &apos;s when there is novelty .
But novelty isn &apos;t about new positions . It isn &apos;t a repertoire of techniques .
Novelty is , what parts of you do you bring out ?
What parts of you are just being seen ?
Because in some way one could say sex isn &apos;t something you do , eh ?
Sex is a place you go . It &apos;s a space you enter inside yourself and with another , or others .
So where do you go in sex ?
What parts of you do you connect to ?
What do you seek to express there ?
Is it a place for transcendence and spiritual union ?
Is it a place for naughtiness and is it a place to be safely aggressive ?
Is it a place where you can finally surrender and not have to take responsibility for everything ?
Is it a place where you can express your infantile wishes ?
What comes out there ? It &apos;s a language .
It isn &apos;t just a behavior .
And it &apos;s the poetic of that language that I &apos;m interested in , which is why I began to explore this concept of erotic intelligence .
You know , animals have sex .
It &apos;s the pivot , it &apos;s biology , it &apos;s the natural instinct .
We are the only ones who have an erotic life , which means that it &apos;s sexuality transformed by the human imagination .
We are the only ones who can make love for hours , have a blissful time , multiple orgasms , and touch nobody , just because we can imagine it .
We can hint at it . We don &apos;t even have to do it .
We can experience that powerful thing called anticipation , which is a mortar to desire , the ability to imagine it , as if it &apos;s happening , to experience it as if it &apos;s happening , while nothing is happening and everything is happening at the same time .
So when I began to think about eroticism , I began to think about the poetics of sex , and if I look at it as an intelligence , then it &apos;s something that you cultivate .
What are the ingredients ? Imagination , playfulness , novelty , curiosity , mystery .
But the central agent is really that piece called the imagination .
But more importantly , for me to begin to understand who are the couples who have an erotic spark , what sustains desire , I had to go back to the original definition of eroticism , the mystical definition , and I went through it through a bifurcation by looking actually at trauma , which is the other side , and I looked at it looking at the community that I had grown up in , which was a community in Belgium , all Holocaust survivors , and in my community there were two groups : those who didn &apos;t die , and those who came back to life .
And those who didn &apos;t die lived often very tethered to the ground , could not experience pleasure , could not trust , because when you &apos;re vigilant , worried , anxious , and insecure , you can &apos;t lift your head to go and take off in space and be playful and safe and imaginative .
Those who came back to life were those who understood the erotic as an antidote to death .
They knew how to keep themselves alive .
And when I began to listen to the sexlessness of the couples that I work with , I sometimes would hear people say , &quot; I want more sex , &quot; but generally people want better sex , and better is to reconnect with that quality of aliveness , of vibrancy , of renewal , of vitality , of eros , of energy that sex used to afford them , or that they &apos;ve hoped it would afford them .
And so I began to ask a different question .
&quot; I shut myself off when ... &quot; began to be the question .
&quot; I turn off my desires when ... &quot; which is not the same question as , &quot; What turns me off is ... &quot; and &quot; You turn me off when ... &quot;
And people began to say , &quot; I turn myself off when I feel dead inside , when I don &apos;t like my body , when I feel old , when I haven &apos;t had time for myself , when I haven &apos;t had a chance to even check in with you , when I don &apos;t perform well at work , when I feel low self esteem , when I don &apos;t have a sense of self-worth , when I don &apos;t feel like I have a right to want , to take , to receive pleasure . &quot;
And then I began to ask the reverse question .
&quot; I turn myself on when ... &quot; Because most of the time , people like to ask the question , &quot; You turn me on , what turns me on , &quot; and I &apos;m out of the question . You know ?
Now , if you are dead inside , the other person can do a lot of things for Valentine &apos;s .
It won &apos;t make a dent . There is nobody at the reception desk .
So I turn myself on when , I turn my desires , I wake up when ...
Now , in this paradox between love and desire , what seems to be so puzzling is that the very ingredients that nurture love -- mutuality , reciprocity , protection , worry , responsibility for the other -- are sometimes the very ingredients that stifle desire .
Because desire comes with a host of feelings that are not always such favorites of love : jealousy , possessiveness , aggression , power , dominance , naughtiness , mischief .
Basically most of us will get turned on at night by the very same things that we will demonstrate against during the day .
You know , the erotic mind is not very politically correct .
If everybody was fantasizing on a bed of roses , we wouldn &apos;t be having such interesting talks about this .
But no , in our mind up there are a host of things going on that we don &apos;t always know how to bring to the person that we love , because we think love comes with selflessness and in fact desire comes with a certain amount of selfishness in the best sense of the word : the ability to stay connected to one &apos;s self in the presence of another .
So I want to draw that little image for you , because this need to reconcile these two sets of needs , we are born with that .
Our need for connection , our need for separateness , or our need for security and adventure , or our need for togetherness and for autonomy , and if you think about the little kid who sits on your lap and who is cozily nested here and very secure and comfortable , and at some point all of us need to go out into the world to discover and to explore .
That &apos;s the beginning of desire , that exploratory needs curiosity , discovery .
And then at some point they turn around and they look at you , and if you tell them , &quot; Hey kiddo , the world &apos;s a great place . Go for it .
There &apos;s so much fun out there , &quot; then they can turn away and they can experience connection and separateness at the same time .
They can go off in their imagination , off in their body , off in their playfulness , all the while knowing that there &apos;s somebody when they come back .
But if on this side there is somebody who says , &quot; I &apos;m worried . I &apos;m anxious . I &apos;m depressed .
My partner hasn &apos;t taken care of me in so long .
What &apos;s so good out there ? Don &apos;t we have everything you need together , you and I ? &quot;
then there are a few little reactions that all of us can pretty much recognize .
Some of us will come back , came back a long time ago , and that little child who comes back is the child who will forgo a part of himself in order not to lose the other .
I will lose my freedom in order not to lose connection .
And I will learn to love in a certain way that will become burdened with extra worry and extra responsibility and extra protection , and I won &apos;t know how to leave you in order to go play , in order to go experience pleasure , in order to discover , to enter inside myself .
Translate this into adult language .
It starts very young . It continues into our sex lives up to the end .
Child number two comes back but looks like that over their shoulder all the time .
&quot; Are you going to be there ?
Are you going to curse me ? Are you going to scold me ?
Are you going to be angry with me ? &quot;
And they may be gone , but they &apos;re never really away , and those are often the people that will tell you , in the beginning it was super hot .
Because in the beginning , the growing intimacy wasn &apos;t yet so strong that it actually led to the decrease of desire .
The more connected I became , the more responsible I felt , the less I was able to let go in your presence .
The third child doesn &apos;t really come back .
So what happens , if you want to sustain desire , it &apos;s that real dialectic piece .
On the one hand you want the security in order to be able to go .
On the other hand if you can &apos;t go , you can &apos;t have pleasure , you can &apos;t culminate , you don &apos;t have an orgasm , you don &apos;t get excited because you spend your time in the body and the head of the other and not in your own .
So in this dilemma about reconciling these two sets of fundamental needs , there are a few things that I &apos;ve come to understand erotic couples do .
One , they have a lot of sexual privacy .
They understand that there is an erotic space that belongs to each of them .
They also understand that foreplay is not something you do five minutes before the real thing .
Foreplay pretty much starts at the end of the previous orgasm .
They also understand that an erotic space isn &apos;t about , you begin to stroke the other .
It &apos;s about you create a space where you leave Management Inc . , maybe where you leave the agile program , and you actually just enter that place where you stop being the good citizen who is taking care of things and being responsible .
Responsibility and desire just butt heads .
They don &apos;t really do well together .
Erotic couples also understand that passion waxes and wanes .
It &apos;s pretty much like the moon . It has intermittent eclipses .
But what they know is they know how to resurrect it .
They know how to bring it back , and they know how to bring it back because they have demystified one big myth , which is the myth of spontaneity , which is that it &apos;s just going to fall from heaven while you &apos;re folding the laundry like a deus ex machina , and in fact they understood that whatever is going to just happen in a long-term relationship already has .
Committed sex is premeditated sex .
It &apos;s willful . It &apos;s intentional .
It &apos;s focus and presence .
Merry Valentine &apos;s .
Nalini Nadkarni : Life science in prison
Nalini Nadkarni challenges our perspective on trees and prisons -- she says both can be more dynamic than we think . Through a partnership with the state of Washington , she brings science classes and conservation programs to inmates , with unexpected results .
Trees epitomize stasis .
Trees are rooted in the ground in one place for many human generations , but if we shift our perspective from the trunk to the twigs , trees become very dynamic entities , moving and growing .
And I decided to explore this movement by turning trees into artists .
I simply tied the end of a paintbrush onto a twig .
I waited for the wind to come up and held up a canvas , and that produced art .
The piece of art you see on your left is painted by a western red cedar and that on your right by a Douglas fir , and what I learned was that different species have different signatures , like a Picasso versus a Monet .
But I was also interested in the movement of trees and how this art might let me capture that and quantify it , so to measure the distance that a single vine maple tree -- which produced this painting -- moved in a single year , I simply measured and summed each of those lines .
I multiplied them by the number of twigs per branch and the number of branches per tree and then divided that by the number of minutes per year .
And so I was able to calculate how far a single tree moved in a single year .
You might have a guess .
The answer is actually 186,540 miles , or seven times around the globe .
And so simply by shifting our perspective from a single trunk to the many dynamic twigs , we are able to see that trees are not simply static entities , but rather extremely dynamic .
And I began to think about ways that we might consider this lesson of trees , to consider other entities that are also static and stuck , but which cry for change and dynamicism , and one of those entities is our prisons .
Prisons , of course , are where people who break our laws are stuck , confined behind bars .
And our prison system itself is stuck .
The United States has over 2.3 million incarcerated men and women .
That number is rising .
Of the 100 incarcerated people that are released , 60 will return to prison .
Funds for education , for training and for rehabilitation are declining , so this despairing cycle of incarceration continues .
I decided to ask whether the lesson I had learned from trees as artists could be applied to a static institution such as our prisons , and I think the answer is yes .
In the year 2007 , I started a partnership with the Washington State Department of Corrections .
Working with four prisons , we began bringing science and scientists , sustainability and conservation projects to four state prisons .
We give science lectures , and the men here are choosing to come to our science lectures instead of watching television or weightlifting .
That , I think , is movement .
We partnered with the Nature Conservancy for inmates at Stafford Creek Correctional Center to grow endangered prairie plants for restoration of relic prairie areas in Washington state .
That , I think , is movement .
We worked with the Washington State Department of Fish and Wildlife to grow endangered frogs -- the Oregon spotted frog -- for later release into protected wetlands .
That , I think , is movement .
And just recently , we &apos;ve begun to work with those men who are segregated in what we call Supermax facilities .
They &apos;ve incurred violent infractions by becoming violent with guards and with other prisoners .
They &apos;re kept in bare cells like this for 23 hours a day .
When they have meetings with their review boards or mental health professionals , they &apos;re placed in immobile booths like this .
For one hour a day they &apos;re brought to these bleak and bland exercise yards .
Although we can &apos;t bring trees and prairie plants and frogs into these environments , we are bringing images of nature into these exercise yards , putting them on the walls , so at least they get contact with visual images of nature .
This is Mr. Lopez , who has been in solitary confinement for 18 months , and he &apos;s providing input on the types of images that he believes would make him and his fellow inmates more serene , more calm , less apt to violence .
And so what we see , I think , is that small , collective movements of change can perhaps move an entity such as our own prison system in a direction of hope .
We know that trees are static entities when we look at their trunks .
But if trees can create art , if they can encircle the globe seven times in one year , if prisoners can grow plants and raise frogs , then perhaps there are other static entities that we hold inside ourselves , like grief , like addictions , like racism , that can also change .
Thank you very much .
Sleepy Man Banjo Boys : Bluegrass virtuosity from ... New Jersey ?
All under the age of 16 , brothers Jonny , Robbie and Tommy Mizzone are from New Jersey , a US state that &apos;s better known for the rock of Bruce Springsteen than the bluegrass of Earl Scruggs . Nonetheless , the siblings began performing bluegrass covers , as well as their own compositions , at a young age . Here , they play three dazzling songs in three different keys , passing the lead back and forth from fiddle to banjo to guitar .
Robbie Mizzone : Thank you .
Tommy Mizzone : Thank you very much .
We &apos;re so excited to be here . It &apos;s such an honor for us .
Like he said , we &apos;re three brothers from New Jersey -- you know , the bluegrass capital of the world .
We discovered bluegrass a few years ago , and we fell in love with it . We hope you guys will too .
This next song is an original we wrote called &quot; Timelapse , &quot; and it will probably live up to its name .
TM : Thank you very much .
RM : I &apos;m just going to take a second to introduce the band .
On guitar is my 15-year-old brother Tommy .
On banjo is 10-year-old Jonny .
He &apos;s also our brother .
And I &apos;m Robbie , and I &apos;m 14 , and I play the fiddle .
As you can see , we decided to make it hard on ourselves , and we chose to play three songs in three different keys .
Yeah . I &apos;m also going to explain , a lot of people want to know where we got the name Sleepy Man Banjo Boys from .
So it started when Jonny was little , and he first started the banjo , he would play on his back with his eyes closed , and we &apos;d say it looked like he was sleeping .
So you can probably piece the rest together .
TM : We can &apos;t really figure out the reason for this .
It might have been that it weighs about a million pounds .
TM : Thank you very much .
RM : Thank you .
Michael Hansmeyer : Building unimaginable shapes
Inspired by cell division , Michael Hansmeyer writes algorithms that design outrageously fascinating shapes and forms with millions of facets . No person could draft them by hand , but they &apos;re buildable -- and they could revolutionize the way we think of architectural form .
As an architect , I often ask myself , what is the origin of the forms that we design ?
What kind of forms could we design if we wouldn &apos;t work with references anymore ?
If we had no bias , if we had no preconceptions , what kind of forms could we design if we could free ourselves from our experience ?
If we could free ourselves from our education ?
What would these unseen forms look like ?
Would they surprise us ? Would they intrigue us ?
Would they delight us ?
If so , then how can we go about creating something that is truly new ?
I propose we look to nature .
Nature has been called the greatest architect of forms .
And I &apos;m not saying that we should copy nature , I &apos;m not saying we should mimic biology , instead I propose that we can borrow nature &apos;s processes .
We can abstract them and to create something that is new .
Nature &apos;s main process of creation , morphogenesis , is the splitting of one cell into two cells .
And these cells can either be identical , or they can be distinct from each other through asymmetric cell division .
If we abstract this process , and simplify it as much as possible , then we could start with a single sheet of paper , one surface , and we could make a fold and divide the surface into two surfaces .
We &apos;re free to choose where we make the fold .
And by doing so , we can differentiate the surfaces .
Through this very simple process , we can create an astounding variety of forms .
Now , we can take this form and use the same process to generate three-dimensional structures , but rather than folding things by hand , we &apos;ll bring the structure into the computer , and code it as an algorithm .
And in doing so , we can suddenly fold anything .
We can fold a million times faster , we can fold in hundreds and hundreds of variations .
And as we &apos;re seeking to make something three-dimensional , we start not with a single surface , but with a volume .
A simple volume , the cube .
If we take its surfaces and fold them again and again and again and again , then after 16 iterations , 16 steps , we end up with 400,000 surfaces and a shape that looks , for instance , like this .
And if we change where we make the folds , if we change the folding ratio , then this cube turns into this one .
We can change the folding ratio again to produce this shape , or this shape .
So we exert control over the form by specifying the position of where we &apos;re making the fold , but essentially you &apos;re looking at a folded cube .
And we can play with this .
We can apply different folding ratios to different parts of the form to create local conditions .
We can begin to sculpt the form .
And because we &apos;re doing the folding on the computer , we are completely free of any physical constraints .
So that means that surfaces can intersect themselves , they can become impossibly small .
We can make folds that we otherwise could not make .
Surfaces can become porous .
They can stretch . They can tear .
And all of this expounds the scope of forms that we can produce .
But in each case , I didn &apos;t design the form .
I designed the process that generated the form .
In general , if we make a small change to the folding ratio , which is what you &apos;re seeing here , then the form changes correspondingly .
But that &apos;s only half of the story -- 99.9 percent of the folding ratios produce not this , but this , the geometric equivalent of noise .
The forms that I showed before were made actually through very long trial and error .
A far more effective way to create forms , I have found , is to use information that is already contained in forms .
A very simple form such as this one actually contains a lot of information that may not be visible to the human eye .
So , for instance , we can plot the length of the edges .
White surfaces have long edges , black ones have short ones .
We can plot the planarity of the surfaces , their curvature , how radial they are -- all information that may not be instantly visible to you , but that we can bring out , that we can articulate , and that we can use to control the folding .
So now I &apos;m not specifying a single ratio anymore to fold it , but instead I &apos;m establishing a rule , I &apos;m establishing a link between a property of a surface and how that surface is folded .
And because I &apos;ve designed the process and not the form , I can run the process again and again and again to produce a whole family of forms .
These forms look elaborate , but the process is a very minimal one .
There is a simple input , it &apos;s always a cube that I start with , and it &apos;s a very simple operation -- it &apos;s making a fold , and doing this over and over again .
So let &apos;s bring this process to architecture .
How ? And at what scale ?
I chose to design a column .
Columns are architectural archetypes .
They &apos;ve been used throughout history to express ideals about beauty , about technology .
A challenge to me was how we could express this new algorithmic order in a column .
I started using four cylinders .
Through a lot of experimentation , these cylinders eventually evolved into this .
And these columns , they have information at very many scales .
We can begin to zoom into them .
The closer one gets , the more new features one discovers .
Some formations are almost at the threshold of human visibility .
And unlike traditional architecture , it &apos;s a single process that creates both the overall form and the microscopic surface detail .
These forms are undrawable .
An architect who &apos;s drawing them with a pen and a paper would probably take months , or it would take even a year to draw all the sections , all of the elevations , you can only create something like this through an algorithm .
The more interesting question , perhaps , is , are these forms imaginable ?
Usually , an architect can somehow envision the end state of what he is designing .
In this case , the process is deterministic .
There &apos;s no randomness involved at all , but it &apos;s not entirely predictable .
There &apos;s too many surfaces , there &apos;s too much detail , one can &apos;t see the end state .
So this leads to a new role for the architect .
One needs a new method to explore all of the possibilities that are out there .
For one thing , one can design many variants of a form , in parallel , and one can cultivate them .
And to go back to the analogy with nature , one can begin to think in terms of populations , one can talk about permutations , about generations , about crossing and breeding to come up with a design .
And the architect is really , he moves into the position of being an orchestrator of all of these processes .
But enough of the theory .
At one point I simply wanted to jump inside this image , so to say , I bought these red and blue 3D glasses , got up very close to the screen , but still that wasn &apos;t the same as being able to walk around and touch things .
So there was only one possibility -- to bring the column out of the computer .
There &apos;s been a lot of talk now about 3D printing .
For me , or for my purpose at this moment , there &apos;s still too much of an unfavorable tradeoff between scale , on the one hand , and resolution and speed , on the other .
So instead , we decided to take the column , and we decided to build it as a layered model , made out of very many slices , thinly stacked over each other .
What you &apos;re looking at here is an X-ray of the column that you just saw , viewed from the top .
Unbeknownst to me at the time , because we had only seen the outside , the surfaces were continuing to fold themselves , to grow on the inside of the column , which was quite a surprising discovery .
From this shape , we calculated a cutting line , and then we gave this cutting line to a laser cutter to produce -- and you &apos;re seeing a segment of it here -- very many thin slices , individually cut , on top of each other .
And this is a photo now , it &apos;s not a rendering , and the column that we ended up with after a lot of work , ended up looking remarkably like the one that we had designed in the computer .
Almost all of the details , almost all of the surface intricacies were preserved .
But it was very labor intensive .
There &apos;s a huge disconnect at the moment still between the virtual and the physical .
It took me several months to design the column , but ultimately it takes the computer about 30 seconds to calculate all of the 16 million faces .
The physical model , on the other hand , is 2,700 layers , one millimeter thick , it weighs 700 kilos , it &apos;s made of sheet that can cover this entire auditorium .
And the cutting path that the laser followed goes from here to the airport and back again .
But it is increasingly possible .
Machines are getting faster , it &apos;s getting less expensive , and there &apos;s some promising technological developments just on the horizon .
These are images from the Gwangju Biennale .
And in this case , I used ABS plastic to produce the columns , we used the bigger , faster machine , and they have a steel core inside , so they &apos;re structural , they can bear loads for once .
Each column is effectively a hybrid of two columns .
You can see a different column in the mirror , if there &apos;s a mirror behind the column that creates a sort of an optical illusion .
So where does this leave us ?
I think this project gives us a glimpse of the unseen objects that await us if we as architects begin to think about designing not the object , but a process to generate objects .
I &apos;ve shown one simple process that was inspired by nature ; there &apos;s countless other ones .
In short , we have no constraints .
Instead , we have processes in our hands right now that allow us to create structures at all scales that we couldn &apos;t even have dreamt up .
And , if I may add , at one point we will build them .
Thank you .
David Hoffman : Sputnik mania
Filmmaker David Hoffman shares footage from his feature-length documentary Sputnik Mania , which shows how the Soviet Union &apos;s launch of Sputnik in 1957 led to both the space race and the arms race -- and jump-started science and math education around the world .
Fifty years ago in the old Soviet Union , a team of engineers was secretly moving a large object through a desolate countryside .
With it , they were hoping to capture the minds of people everywhere by being the first to conquer outer space .
The rocket was huge .
And packed in its nose was a silver ball with two radios inside .
On October 4 , 1957 , they launched their rocket .
One of the Russian scientists wrote at the time : &quot; We are about to create a new planet that we will call Sputnik .
In the olden days , explorers like Vasco da Gama and Columbus had the good fortune to open up the terrestrial globe .
Now we have the good fortune to open up space .
And it is for those in the future to envy us our joy . &quot;
You &apos;re watching snippets from &quot; Sputnik , &quot; my fifth documentary feature , which is just about completed .
It tells the story of Sputnik , and the story of what happened to America as a result .
For days after the launch , Sputnik was a wonderful curiosity .
A man-made moon visible by ordinary citizens , it inspired awe and pride that humans had finally launched an object into space .
But just three days later , on a day they called Red Monday , the media and the politicians told us , and we believed , that Sputnik was proof that our enemy had beaten us in science and technology , and that they could now attack us with hydrogen bombs , using their Sputnik rocket as an IBM missile .
All hell broke loose .
Sputnik quickly became one of the three great shocks to hit America -- historians say the equal of Pearl Harbor or 9 / 11 .
It provoked the missile gap .
It exploded an arms race .
It began the space race .
Within a year , Congress funded huge weapons increases , and we went from 1,200 nuclear weapons to 20,000 .
And the reactions to Sputnik went far beyond weapons increases .
For example , some here will remember this day , June 1958 , the National Civil Defense Drill , where tens of millions of people in 78 cities went underground .
Or the Gallup Poll that showed that seven in 10 Americans believed that a nuclear war would happen , and that at least 50 percent of our population was going to be killed .
But Sputnik provoked wonderful changes as well .
For example , some in this room went to school on scholarship because of Sputnik .
Support for engineering , math and science -- education in general -- boomed .
And Vint Cerf points out that Sputnik led directly to ARPA , and the Internet , and , of course , NASA .
My feature documentary shows how a free society can be stampeded by those who know how to use media .
But it also shows how we can turn what appears at first to be a bad situation , into something that was overall very good for America .
&quot; Sputnik &quot; will soon be released .
In closing , I would like to take a moment to thank one of my investors : longtime TEDster , Jay Walker .
And I &apos;d like to thank you all .
Thank you , Chris .
Harish Manwani : Profit &apos;s not always the point
You might not expect the chief operating officer of a major global corporation to look too far beyond either the balance sheet or the bottom line . But Harish Manwani , COO of Unilever , makes a passionate argument that doing so to include value , purpose and sustainability in top-level decision-making is not just savvy , it &apos;s the only way to run a 21st century business responsibly .
The entire model of capitalism and the economic model that you and I did business in , and , in fact , continue to do business in , was built around what probably Milton Friedman put more succinctly .
And Adam Smith , of course , the father of modern economics actually said many , many years ago , the invisible hand , which is , &quot; If you continue to operate in your own self-interest you will do the best good for society . &quot;
Now , capitalism has done a lot of good things and I &apos;ve talked about a lot of good things that have happened , but equally , it has not been able to meet up with some of the challenges that we &apos;ve seen in society .
The model that at least I was brought up in and a lot of us doing business were brought up in was one which talked about what I call the three G &apos;s of growth : growth that is consistent , quarter on quarter ; growth that is competitive , better than the other person ; and growth that is profitable , so you continue to make more and more shareholder value .
And I &apos;m afraid this is not going to be good enough and we have to move from this 3G model to a model of what I call the fourth G : the G of growth that is responsible .
And it is this that has to become a very important part of creating value .
Of not just creating economic value but creating social value .
And companies that will thrive are those that will actually embrace the fourth G.
And the model of 4G is quite simple : Companies cannot afford to be just innocent bystanders in what &apos;s happening around in society .
They have to begin to play their role in terms of serving the communities which actually sustain them .
And we have to move to a model of an and / and model which is how do we make money and do good ?
How do we make sure that we have a great business but we also have a great environment around us ?
And that model is all about doing well and doing good .
But the question is easier said than done .
But how do we actually get that done ?
And I do believe that the answer to that is going to be leadership .
It is going to be to redefine the new business models which understand that the only license to operate is to combine these things .
And for that you need businesses that can actually define their role in society in terms of a much larger purpose than the products and brands that they sell .
And companies that actually define a true north , things that are nonnegotiable whether times are good , bad , ugly -- doesn &apos;t matter .
There are things that you stand for .
Values and purpose are going to be the two drivers of software that are going to create the companies of tomorrow .
And I &apos;m going to now shift to talking a little bit about my own experiences .
I joined Unilever in 1976 as a management trainee in India .
And on my first day of work I walked in and my boss tells me , &quot; Do you know why you &apos;re here ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m here to sell a lot of soap . &quot;
And he said , &quot; No , you &apos;re here to change lives . &quot;
You &apos;re here to change lives .
You know , I thought it was rather facetious .
We are a company that sells soap and soup .
What are we doing about changing lives ?
And it &apos;s then I realized that simple acts like selling a bar of soap can save more lives than pharmaceutical companies .
I don &apos;t know how many of you know that five million children don &apos;t reach the age of five because of simple infections that can be prevented by an act of washing their hands with soap .
We run the largest hand-washing program in the world .
We are running a program on hygiene and health that now touches half a billion people .
It &apos;s not about selling soap , there is a larger purpose out there .
And brands indeed can be at the forefront of social change .
And the reason for that is , when two billion people use your brands that &apos;s the amplifier .
Small actions can make a big difference .
Take another example , I was walking around in one of our villages in India .
Now those of you who have done this will realize that this is no walk in the park .
And we had this lady who was one of our small distributors -- beautiful , very , very modest , her home -- and she was out there , dressed nicely , her husband in the back , her mother-in-law behind and her sister-in-law behind her .
The social order was changing because this lady is part of our Project Shakti that is actually teaching women how to do small business and how to carry the message of nutrition and hygiene .
We have 60,000 such women now in India .
It &apos;s not about selling soap , it &apos;s about making sure that in the process of doing so you can change people &apos;s lives .
Small actions , big difference .
Our R &amp; amp ; D folks are not only working to give us some fantastic detergents , but they &apos;re working to make sure we use less water .
A product that we &apos;ve just launched recently , One Rinse product that allows you to save water every time you wash your clothes .
And if we can convert all our users to using this , that &apos;s 500 billion liters of water .
By the way , that &apos;s equivalent to one month of water for a whole huge continent .
So just think about it .
There are small actions that can make a big difference .
And I can go on and on .
Our food chain , our brilliant products -- and I &apos;m sorry I &apos;m giving you a word from the sponsors -- Knorr , Hellman &apos;s and all those wonderful products .
We are committed to making sure that all our agricultural raw materials are sourced from sustainable sources , 100-percent sustainable sources .
We were the first to say we are going to buy all of our palm oil from sustainable sources .
I don &apos;t know how many of you know that palm oil , and not buying it from sustainable sources , can create deforestation that is responsible for 20 percent of the greenhouse gasses in the world .
We were the first to embrace that , and it &apos;s all because we market soap and soup .
And the point I &apos;m making here is that companies like yours , companies like mine have to define a purpose which embraces responsibility and understands that we have to play our part in the communities in which we operate .
We introduced something called The Unilever Sustainable Living Plan , which said , &quot; Our purpose is to make sustainable living commonplace , and we are gong to change the lives of one billion people over 2020 . &quot;
Now the question here is , where do we go from here ?
And the answer to that is very simple : We &apos;re not going to change the world alone .
There are plenty of you and plenty of us who understand this .
The question is , we need partnerships , we need coalitions and importantly , we need that leadership that will allow us to take this from here and to be the change that we want to see around us .
Thank you very much .
Susan Cain : The power of introverts
In a culture where being social and outgoing are prized above all else , it can be difficult , even shameful , to be an introvert . But , as Susan Cain argues in this passionate talk , introverts bring extraordinary talents and abilities to the world , and should be encouraged and celebrated .
When I was nine years old I went off to summer camp for the first time .
And my mother packed me a suitcase full of books , which to me seemed like a perfectly natural thing to do .
Because in my family , reading was the primary group activity .
And this might sound antisocial to you , but for us it was really just a different way of being social .
You have the animal warmth of your family sitting right next to you , but you are also free to go roaming around the adventureland inside your own mind .
And I had this idea that camp was going to be just like this , but better .
I had a vision of 10 girls sitting in a cabin cozily reading books in their matching nightgowns .
Camp was more like a keg party without any alcohol .
And on the very first day our counselor gathered us all together and she taught us a cheer that she said we would be doing every day for the rest of the summer to instill camp spirit .
And it went like this : &quot; R-O-W-D-I-E , that &apos;s the way we spell rowdie .
Rowdie , rowdie , let &apos;s get rowdie . &quot;
Yeah .
So I couldn &apos;t figure out for the life of me why we were supposed to be so rowdy , or why we had to spell this word incorrectly .
But I recited a cheer . I recited a cheer along with everybody else .
I did my best .
And I just waited for the time that I could go off and read my books .
But the first time that I took my book out of my suitcase , the coolest girl in the bunk came up to me and she asked me , &quot; Why are you being so mellow ? &quot; -- mellow , of course , being the exact opposite of R-O-W-D-I-E .
And then the second time I tried it , the counselor came up to me with a concerned expression on her face and she repeated the point about camp spirit and said we should all work very hard to be outgoing .
And so I put my books away , back in their suitcase , and I put them under my bed , and there they stayed for the rest of the summer .
And I felt kind of guilty about this .
I felt as if the books needed me somehow , and they were calling out to me and I was forsaking them .
But I did forsake them and I didn &apos;t open that suitcase again until I was back home with my family at the end of the summer .
Now , I tell you this story about summer camp .
I could have told you 50 others just like it -- all the times that I got the message that somehow my quiet and introverted style of being was not necessarily the right way to go , that I should be trying to pass as more of an extrovert .
And I always sensed deep down that this was wrong and that introverts were pretty excellent just as they were .
But for years I denied this intuition , and so I became a Wall Street lawyer , of all things , instead of the writer that I had always longed to be -- partly because I needed to prove to myself that I could be bold and assertive too .
And I was always going off to crowded bars when I really would have preferred to just have a nice dinner with friends .
And I made these self-negating choices so reflexively , that I wasn &apos;t even aware that I was making them .
Now this is what many introverts do , and it &apos;s our loss for sure , but it is also our colleagues &apos; loss and our communities &apos; loss .
And at the risk of sounding grandiose , it is the world &apos;s loss .
Because when it comes to creativity and to leadership , we need introverts doing what they do best .
A third to a half of the population are introverts -- a third to a half .
So that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
So even if you &apos;re an extrovert yourself , I &apos;m talking about your coworkers and your spouses and your children and the person sitting next to you right now -- all of them subject to this bias that is pretty deep and real in our society .
We all internalize it from a very early age without even having a language for what we &apos;re doing .
Now to see the bias clearly you need to understand what introversion is .
It &apos;s different from being shy .
Shyness is about fear of social judgment .
Introversion is more about , how do you respond to stimulation , including social stimulation .
So extroverts really crave large amounts of stimulation , whereas introverts feel at their most alive and their most switched-on and their most capable when they &apos;re in quieter , more low-key environments .
Not all the time -- these things aren &apos;t absolute -- but a lot of the time .
So the key then to maximizing our talents is for us all to put ourselves in the zone of stimulation that is right for us .
But now here &apos;s where the bias comes in .
Our most important institutions , our schools and our workplaces , they are designed mostly for extroverts and for extroverts &apos; need for lots of stimulation .
And also we have this belief system right now that I call the new groupthink , which holds that all creativity and all productivity comes from a very oddly gregarious place .
So if you picture the typical classroom nowadays : When I was going to school , we sat in rows .
We sat in rows of desks like this , and we did most of our work pretty autonomously .
But nowadays , your typical classroom has pods of desks -- four or five or six or seven kids all facing each other .
And kids are working in countless group assignments .
Even in subjects like math and creative writing , which you think would depend on solo flights of thought , kids are now expected to act as committee members .
And for the kids who prefer to go off by themselves or just to work alone , those kids are seen as outliers often or , worse , as problem cases .
And the vast majority of teachers reports believing that the ideal student is an extrovert as opposed to an introvert , even though introverts actually get better grades and are more knowledgeable , according to research .
Okay , same thing is true in our workplaces .
Now , most of us work in open plan offices , without walls , where we are subject to the constant noise and gaze of our coworkers .
And when it comes to leadership , introverts are routinely passed over for leadership positions , even though introverts tend to be very careful , much less likely to take outsize risks -- which is something we might all favor nowadays .
And interesting research by Adam Grant at the Wharton School has found that introverted leaders often deliver better outcomes than extroverts do , because when they are managing proactive employees , they &apos;re much more likely to let those employees run with their ideas , whereas an extrovert can , quite unwittingly , get so excited about things that they &apos;re putting their own stamp on things , and other people &apos;s ideas might not as easily then bubble up to the surface .
Now in fact , some of our transformative leaders in history have been introverts .
I &apos;ll give you some examples .
Eleanor Roosevelt , Rosa Parks , Gandhi -- all these peopled described themselves as quiet and soft-spoken and even shy .
And they all took the spotlight , even though every bone in their bodies was telling them not to .
And this turns out to have a special power all its own , because people could feel that these leaders were at the helm , not because they enjoyed directing others and not out of the pleasure of being looked at ; they were there because they had no choice , because they were driven to do what they thought was right .
Now I think at this point it &apos;s important for me to say that I actually love extroverts .
I always like to say some of my best friends are extroverts , including my beloved husband .
And we all fall at different points , of course , along the introvert / extrovert spectrum .
Even Carl Jung , the psychologist who first popularized these terms , said that there &apos;s no such thing as a pure introvert or a pure extrovert .
He said that such a man would be in a lunatic asylum , if he existed at all .
And some people fall smack in the middle of the introvert / extrovert spectrum , and we call these people ambiverts .
And I often think that they have the best of all worlds .
But many of us do recognize ourselves as one type or the other .
And what I &apos;m saying is that culturally we need a much better balance .
We need more of a yin and yang between these two types .
This is especially important when it comes to creativity and to productivity , because when psychologists look at the lives of the most creative people , what they find are people who are very good at exchanging ideas and advancing ideas , but who also have a serious streak of introversion in them .
And this is because solitude is a crucial ingredient often to creativity .
So Darwin , he took long walks alone in the woods and emphatically turned down dinner party invitations .
Theodor Geisel , better known as Dr. Seuss , he dreamed up many of his amazing creations in a lonely bell tower office that he had in the back of his house in La Jolla , California .
And he was actually afraid to meet the young children who read his books for fear that they were expecting him this kind of jolly Santa Claus-like figure and would be disappointed with his more reserved persona .
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time .
And he says that he never would have become such an expert in the first place had he not been too introverted to leave the house when he was growing up .
Now of course , this does not mean that we should all stop collaborating -- and case in point , is Steve Wozniak famously coming together with Steve Jobs to start Apple Computer -- but it does mean that solitude matters and that for some people it is the air that they breathe .
And in fact , we have known for centuries about the transcendent power of solitude .
It &apos;s only recently that we &apos;ve strangely begun to forget it .
If you look at most of the world &apos;s major religions , you will find seekers -- Moses , Jesus , Buddha , Muhammad -- seekers who are going off by themselves alone to the wilderness where they then have profound epiphanies and revelations that they then bring back to the rest of the community .
So no wilderness , no revelations .
This is no surprise though if you look at the insights of contemporary psychology .
It turns out that we can &apos;t even be in a group of people without instinctively mirroring , mimicking their opinions .
Even about seemingly personal and visceral things like who you &apos;re attracted to , you will start aping the beliefs of the people around you without even realizing that that &apos;s what you &apos;re doing .
And groups famously follow the opinions of the most dominant or charismatic person in the room , even though there &apos;s zero correlation between being the best talker and having the best ideas -- I mean zero .
So ...
You might be following the person with the best ideas , but you might not .
And do you really want to leave it up to chance ?
Much better for everybody to go off by themselves , generate their own ideas freed from the distortions of group dynamics , and then come together as a team to talk them through in a well-managed environment and take it from there .
Now if all this is true , then why are we getting it so wrong ?
Why are we setting up our schools this way and our workplaces ?
And why are we making these introverts feel so guilty about wanting to just go off by themselves some of the time ?
One answer lies deep in our cultural history .
Western societies , and in particular the U.S. , have always favored the man of action over the man of contemplation and &quot; man &quot; of contemplation .
But in America &apos;s early days , we lived in what historians call a culture of character , where we still , at that point , valued people for their inner selves and their moral rectitude .
And if you look at the self-help books from this era , they all had titles with things like &quot; Character , the Grandest Thing in the World . &quot;
And they featured role models like Abraham Lincoln who was praised for being modest and unassuming .
Ralph Waldo Emerson called him &quot; A man who does not offend by superiority . &quot;
But then we hit the 20th century and we entered a new culture that historians call the culture of personality .
What happened is we had evolved an agricultural economy to a world of big business .
And so suddenly people are moving from small towns to the cities .
And instead of working alongside people they &apos;ve known all their lives , now they are having to prove themselves in a crowd of strangers .
So , quite understandably , qualities like magnetism and charisma suddenly come to seem really important .
And sure enough , the self-help books change to meet these new needs and they start to have names like &quot; How to Win Friends and Influence People . &quot;
And they feature as their role models really great salesmen .
So that &apos;s the world we &apos;re living in today .
That &apos;s our cultural inheritance .
Now none of this is to say that social skills are unimportant , and I &apos;m also not calling for the abolishing of teamwork at all .
The same religions who send their sages off to lonely mountain tops also teach us love and trust .
And the problems that we are facing today in fields like science and in economics are so vast and so complex that we are going to need armies of people coming together to solve them working together .
But I am saying that the more freedom that we give introverts to be themselves , the more likely that they are to come up with their own unique solutions to these problems .
So now I &apos;d like to share with you what &apos;s in my suitcase today .
Guess what ?
Books .
I have a suitcase full of books .
Here &apos;s Margaret Atwood , &quot; Cat &apos;s Eye . &quot;
Here &apos;s a novel by Milan Kundera .
And here &apos;s &quot; The Guide for the Perplexed &quot; by Maimonides .
But these are not exactly my books .
I brought these books with me because they were written by my grandfather &apos;s favorite authors .
My grandfather was a rabbi and he was a widower who lived alone in a small apartment in Brooklyn that was my favorite place in the world when I was growing up , partly because it was filled with his very gentle , very courtly presence and partly because it was filled with books .
I mean literally every table , every chair in this apartment had yielded its original function to now serve as a surface for swaying stacks of books .
Just like the rest of my family , my grandfather &apos;s favorite thing to do in the whole world was to read .
But he also loved his congregation , and you could feel this love in the sermons that he gave every week for the 62 years that he was a rabbi .
He would takes the fruits of each week &apos;s reading and he would weave these intricate tapestries of ancient and humanist thought .
And people would come from all over to hear him speak .
But here &apos;s the thing about my grandfather .
Underneath this ceremonial role , he was really modest and really introverted -- so much so that when he delivered these sermons , he had trouble making eye contact with the very same congregation that he had been speaking to for 62 years .
And even away from the podium , when you called him to say hello , he would often end the conversation prematurely for fear that he was taking up too much of your time .
But when he died at the age of 94 , the police had to close down the streets of his neighborhood to accommodate the crowd of people who came out to mourn him .
And so these days I try to learn from my grandfather &apos;s example in my own way .
So I just published a book about introversion , and it took me about seven years to write .
And for me , that seven years was like total bliss , because I was reading , I was writing , I was thinking , I was researching .
It was my version of my grandfather &apos;s hours of the day alone in his library .
But now all of a sudden my job is very different , and my job is to be out here talking about it , talking about introversion .
And that &apos;s a lot harder for me , because as honored as I am to be here with all of you right now , this is not my natural milieu .
So I prepared for moments like these as best I could .
I spent the last year practicing public speaking every chance I could get .
And I call this my &quot; year of speaking dangerously . &quot;
And that actually helped a lot .
But I &apos;ll tell you , what helps even more is my sense , my belief , my hope that when it comes to our attitudes to introversion and to quiet and to solitude , we truly are poised on the brink on dramatic change .
I mean , we are .
And so I am going to leave you now with three calls for action for those who share this vision .
Number one : Stop the madness for constant group work .
Just stop it .
Thank you .
And I want to be clear about what I &apos;m saying , because I deeply believe our offices should be encouraging casual , chatty cafe-style types of interactions -- you know , the kind where people come together and serendipitously have an exchange of ideas .
That is great .
It &apos;s great for introverts and it &apos;s great for extroverts .
But we need much more privacy and much more freedom and much more autonomy at work .
School , same thing .
We need to be teaching kids to work together , for sure , but we also need to be teaching them how to work on their own .
This is especially important for extroverted children too .
They need to work on their own because that is where deep thought comes from in part .
Okay , number two : Go to the wilderness .
Be like Buddha , have your own revelations .
I &apos;m not saying that we all have to now go off and build our own cabins in the woods and never talk to each other again , but I am saying that we could all stand to unplug and get inside our own heads a little more often .
Number three : Take a good look at what &apos;s inside your own suitcase and why you put it there .
So extroverts , maybe your suitcases are also full of books .
Or maybe they &apos;re full of champagne glasses or skydiving equipment .
Whatever it is , I hope you take these things out every chance you get and grace us with your energy and your joy .
But introverts , you being you , you probably have the impulse to guard very carefully what &apos;s inside your own suitcase .
And that &apos;s okay .
But occasionally , just occasionally , I hope you will open up your suitcases for other people to see , because the world needs you and it needs the things you carry .
So I wish you the best of all possible journeys and the courage to speak softly .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you .
Yves Behar : Designing objects that tell stories
Designer Yves Behar digs up his creative roots to discuss some of the iconic objects he &apos;s created . Then he turns to the witty , surprising , elegant objects he &apos;s working on now -- including the &quot; $ 100 laptop . &quot;
Being a child , and sort of crawling around the house , I remember these Turkish carpets , and there were these scenes , these battle scenes , these love scenes .
I mean , look , this animal is trying to fight back this spear from this soldier .
And my mom took these pictures actually , last week , of our carpets , and I remember this to this day .
There was another object , this sort of towering piece of furniture with creatures and gargoyles and nudity -- pretty scary stuff , when you &apos;re a little kid .
What I remember today from this is that objects tell stories , so storytelling has been a really strong influence in my work .
And then there was another influence .
I was a teenager , and at 15 or 16 , I guess like all teenagers , we want to just do what we love and what we believe in .
And so , I fused together the two things I loved the most , which was skiing and windsurfing .
Those are pretty good escapes from the drab weather in Switzerland .
So , I created this compilation of the two : I took my skis and I took a board and I put a mast foot in there , and some foot straps , and some metal fins , and here I was , going really fast on frozen lakes .
It was really a death trap . I mean , it was incredible , it worked incredibly well , but it was really dangerous .
And I realized then I had to go to design school .
I mean , look at those graphics there .
So , I went to design school , and it was the early &apos; 90s when I finished .
And I saw something extraordinary happening in Silicon Valley , so I wanted to be there , and I saw that the computer was coming into our homes , that it had to change in order to be with us in our homes .
And so I got myself a job and I was working for a consultancy , and we would get in to these meetings , and these managers would come in , and they would say , &quot; Well , what we &apos;re going to do here is really important , you know . &quot;
And they would give the projects code names , you know , mostly from &quot; Star Wars , &quot; actually : things like C3PO , Yoda , Luke .
So , in anticipation , I would be this young designer in the back of the room , and I would raise my hand , and I would ask questions .
I mean , in retrospect , probably stupid questions , but things like , &quot; What &apos;s this Caps Lock key for ? &quot;
or &quot; What &apos;s this Num Lock key for ? &quot; You know , that thing ?
&quot; You know , do people really use it ?
Do they need it ? Do they want it in their homes ? &quot;
What I realized then is , they didn &apos;t really want to change the legacy stuff ; they didn &apos;t want to change the insides .
They were really looking for us , the designers , to create the skins , to put some pretty stuff outside of the box .
And I didn &apos;t want to be a colorist .
It wasn &apos;t what I wanted to do .
I didn &apos;t want to be a stylist in this way .
And then I saw this quote : &quot; advertising is the price companies pay for being unoriginal . &quot;
So , I had to start on my own . So I moved to San Francisco , and I started a little company , fuseproject .
And what I wanted to work on is important stuff .
And I wanted to really not just work on the skins , but I wanted to work on the entire human experience .
And so the first projects were sort of humble , but they took technology and maybe made it into things that people would use in a new way , and maybe finding some new functionality .
This is a watch we made for Mini Cooper , the car company , right when it launched , and it &apos;s the first watch that has a display that switches from horizontal to vertical .
And that allows me to check my timer discretely , here , without bending my elbow .
And other projects , which were really about transformation , about matching the human need .
This is a little piece of furniture for an Italian manufacturer , and it ships completely flat , and then it folds into a coffee table and a stool and whatnot .
And something a little bit more experimental : this is a light fixture for Swarovski , and what it does is , it changes shape .
So , it goes from a circle , to a round , to a square , to a figure eight .
And just by drawing on a little computer tablet , the entire light fixture adjusts to what shape you want .
And then finally , the leaf lamp for Herman Miller .
This is a pretty involved process ; it took us about four and a half years .
But I really was looking for creating a unique experience of light , a new experience of light .
So , we had to design both the light and the light bulb .
And that &apos;s a unique opportunity , I would say , in design .
And the new experience I was looking for is giving the choice for the user to go from a warm , sort of glowing kind of mood light , all the way to a bright work light .
So , the light bulb actually does that .
It allows the person to switch , and to mix these two colorations .
And it &apos;s done in a very simple way : one just touches the base of the light , and on one side , you can mix the brightness , and on the other , the coloration of the light .
So , all of these projects have a humanistic sense to them , and I think as designers we need to really think about how we can create a different relationship between our work and the world , whether it &apos;s for business , or , as I &apos;m going to show , on some civic-type projects .
Because I think everybody agrees that as designers we bring value to business , value to the users also , but I think it &apos;s the values that we put into these projects that ultimately create the greater value .
And the values we bring can be about environmental issues , about sustainability , about lower power consumption .
You know , they can be about function and beauty ; they can be about business strategy .
But designers are really the glue that brings these things together .
So Jawbone is a project that you &apos;re familiar with , and it has a humanistic technology .
It feels your skin . It rests on your skin , and it knows when it is you &apos;re talking .
And by knowing when it is you &apos;re talking , it gets rid of the other noises that it knows about , which is the environmental noises .
But the other thing that is humanistic about Jawbone is that we really decided to take out all the techie stuff , and all the nerdy stuff out of it , and try to make it as beautiful as we can .
I mean , think about it : the care we take in selecting sunglasses , or jewelry , or accessories is really important , so if it isn &apos;t beautiful , it really doesn &apos;t belong on your face .
And this is what we &apos;re pursuing here .
But how we work on Jawbone is really unique .
I want to point at something here , on the left .
This is the board , this is one of the things that goes inside that makes this technology work .
But this is the design process : there &apos;s somebody changing the board , putting tracers on the board , changing the location of the ICs , as the designers on the other side are doing the work .
So , it &apos;s not about slapping skins , anymore , on a technology .
It &apos;s really about designing from the inside out .
And then , on the other side of the room , the designers are making small adjustments , sketching , drawing by hand , putting it in the computer .
And it &apos;s what I call being design driven .
You know , there is some push and pull , but design is really helping define the whole experience from the inside out .
And then , of course , design is never done .
And this is -- the other new way that is unique in how we work is , because it &apos;s never done , you have to do all this other stuff .
The packaging , and the website , and you need to continue to really touch the user , in many ways .
But how do you retain somebody , when it &apos;s never done ?
And Hosain Rahman , the CEO of Aliph Jawbone , you know , really understands that you need a different structure .
So , in a way , the different structure is that we &apos;re partners , it &apos;s a partnership . We can continue to work and dedicate ourselves to this project , and then we also share in the rewards .
And here &apos;s another project , another partnership-type approach .
This is called Y Water , and it &apos;s this guy from Los Angeles , Thomas Arndt , Austrian originally , who came to us , and all he wanted to do was to create a healthy drink , or an organic drink for his kids , to replace the high-sugar-content sodas that he &apos;s trying to get them away from .
So , we worked on this bottle , and it &apos;s completely symmetrical in every dimension .
And this allows the bottle to turn into a game .
The bottles connect together , and you can create different shapes , different forms .
Thank you .
And then while we were doing this , the shape of the bottle upside down reminded us of a Y , and then we thought , well these words , &quot; why &quot; and &quot; why not , &quot; are probably the most important words that kids ask .
So we called it Y Water . And so this is another place where it all comes together in the same room : the three-dimensional design , the ideas , the branding , it all becomes deeply connected .
And then the other thing about this project is , we bring intellectual property , we bring a marketing approach , we bring all this stuff , but I think , at the end of the day , what we bring is these values , and these values create a soul for the companies we work with .
And it &apos;s especially rewarding when your design work becomes a creative endeavor , when others can be creative and do more with it .
Here &apos;s another project , which I think really emulates that .
This is the One Laptop per Child , the $ 100 laptop .
This picture is incredible .
In Nigeria , people carry their most precious belongings on their heads .
This girl is going to school with a laptop on her head .
I mean , to me , it just means so much .
But when Nicholas Negroponte -- and he has spoken about this project a lot , he &apos;s the founder of OLPC -- came to us about two and a half years ago , there were some clear ideas .
He wanted to bring education and he wanted to bring technology , and those are pillars of his life , but also pillars of the mission of One Laptop per Child .
But the third pillar that he talked about was design .
And at the time , I wasn &apos;t really working on computers .
I didn &apos;t really want to , from the previous adventure .
But what he said was really significant , is that design was going to be why the kids were going to love this product , how we were going to make it low cost , robust .
And plus , he said he was going to get rid of the Caps Lock key -- -- and the Num Lock key , too .
So , I was convinced . We designed it to be iconic , to look different . To look like it &apos;s for a kid , but not like a toy .
And then the integration of all these great technologies , which you &apos;ve heard about , the Wi-Fi antennas that allow the kids to connect ; the screen , which you can read in sunlight ; the keyboard , which is made out of rubber , and it &apos;s protected from the environment .
You know , all these great technologies really happened because of the passion and the OLPC people and the engineers .
They fought the suppliers , they fought the manufacturers .
I mean , they fought like animals for this to remain they way it is .
And in a way , it is that will that makes projects like this one -- allows the process from not destroying the original idea .
And I think this is something really important .
So , now you get these pictures -- you get up in the morning , and you see the kids in Nigeria and you see them in Uruguay with their computers , and in Mongolia .
And we went away from obviously the beige .
I mean it &apos;s colorful , it &apos;s fun .
In fact , you can see each logo is a little bit different .
It &apos;s because we were able to run , during the manufacturing process , 20 colors for the X and the O , which is the name of the computer , and by mixing them on the manufacturing floor , you get 20 times 20 : you get 400 different options there .
So , the lessons from seeing the kids using them in the developing world are incredible .
But this is my nephew , Anthony , in Switzerland , and he had the laptop for an afternoon , and I had to take it back . It was hard .
And it was a prototype . And a month and a half later , I come back to Switzerland , and there he is playing with his own version .
Like paper , paper and cardboard .
So , I &apos;m going to finish with one last project , and this is a little bit more of adult play .
Some of you might have heard about the New York City condom .
It &apos;s actually just launched , actually launched on Valentine &apos;s Day , February 14 , about 10 days ago .
So , the Department of Health in New York came to us , and they needed a way to distribute 36 million condoms for free to the citizens of New York .
So a pretty big endeavor , and we worked on the dispensers .
These are the dispensers . There &apos;s this friendly shape .
It &apos;s a little bit like designing a fire hydrant , and it has to be easily serviceable : you have to know where it is and what it does .
And we also designed the condoms themselves .
And I was just in New York at the launch , and I went to see all these places where they &apos;re installed : this is at a Puerto Rican little mom-and-pop store ; at a bar in Christopher Street ; at a pool hall .
I mean , they &apos;re being installed in homeless clinics -- everywhere .
Of course , clubs and discos , too .
And here &apos;s the public service announcement for this project .
Get some .
So , this is really where design is able to create a conversation .
I was in these venues , and people were , you know , really into getting them . They were excited .
It was breaking the ice , it was getting over a stigma , and I think that &apos;s also what design can do .
So , I was going to throw some condoms in the room and whatnot , but I &apos;m not sure it &apos;s the etiquette here .
Yeah ? All right , all right . I have only a few .
So , I have more , you can always ask me for some more later .
And if anybody asks why you &apos;re carrying a condom , you can just say you like the design .
So , I &apos;ll finish with just one thought : if we all work together on creating value , but if we really keep in mind the values of the work that we do , I think we can change the work that we do .
We can change these values , can change the companies we work with , and eventually , together , maybe we can change the world .
So , thank you .
Paul Root Wolpe : It &apos;s time to question bio-engineering
Bioethicist Paul Root Wolpe describes an astonishing series of recent bio-engineering experiments , from glowing dogs to mice that grow human ears . He asks : Isn &apos;t it time to set some ground rules ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Today I want to talk about design , but not design as we usually think about it .
I want to talk about what is happening now in our scientific , biotechnological culture , where , for really the first time in history , we have the power to design bodies , to design animal bodies , to design human bodies .
In the history of our planet , there have been three great waves of evolution .
The first wave of evolution is what we think of as Darwinian evolution .
So , as you all know , species lived in particular ecological niches and particular environments , and the pressures of those environments selected which changes , through random mutation in species , were going to be preserved .
Then human beings stepped out of the Darwinian flow of evolutionary history and created the second great wave of evolution , which was we changed the environment in which we evolved .
We altered our ecological niche by creating civilization .
And that has been the second great -- couple 100,000 years , 150,000 years -- flow of our evolution .
By changing our environment , we put new pressures on our bodies to evolve .
Whether it was through settling down in agricultural communities , all the way through modern medicine , we have changed our own evolution .
Now we &apos;re entering a third great wave of evolutionary history , which has been called many things : &quot; intentional evolution , &quot; &quot; evolution by design &quot; -- very different than intelligent design -- whereby we are actually now intentionally designing and altering the physiological forms that inhabit our planet .
So I want to take you through a kind of whirlwind tour of that and then at the end talk a little bit about what some of the implications are for us and for our species , as well as our cultures , because of this change .
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
We started selectively breeding animals many , many thousands of years ago .
And if you think of dogs for example , dogs are now intentionally-designed creatures .
There isn &apos;t a dog on this earth that &apos;s a natural creature .
Dogs are the result of selectively breeding traits that we like .
But we had to do it the hard way in the old days by choosing offspring that looked a particular way and then breeding them .
We don &apos;t have to do it that way anymore .
This is a beefalo .
A beefalo is a buffalo-cattle hybrid .
And they are now making them , and someday , perhaps pretty soon , you will have beefalo patties in your local supermarket .
This is a geep , a goat-sheep hybrid .
The scientists that made this cute little creature ended up slaughtering it and eating it afterwards .
I think they said it tasted like chicken .
This is a cama .
A cama is a camel-llama hybrid , created to try to get the hardiness of a camel with some of the personality traits of a llama .
And they are now using these in certain cultures .
Then there &apos;s the liger .
This is the largest cat in the world -- the lion-tiger hybrid .
It &apos;s bigger than a tiger .
And in the case of the liger , there actually have been one or two that have been seen in the wild .
But these were created by scientists using both selective breeding and genetic technology .
And then finally , everybody &apos;s favorite , the zorse .
None of this is Photoshopped . These are real creatures .
And so one of the things we &apos;ve been doing is using genetic enhancement , or genetic manipulation , of normal selective breeding pushed a little bit through genetics .
And if that were all this was about , then it would be an interesting thing .
But something much , much more powerful is happening now .
These are normal mammalian cells genetically engineered with a bioluminescent gene taken out of deep-sea jellyfish .
We all know that some deep-sea creatures glow .
Well , they &apos;ve now taken that gene , that bioluminescent gene , and put it into mammal cells .
These are normal cells .
And what you see here is these cells glowing in the dark under certain wavelengths of light .
Once they could do that with cells , they could do it with organisms .
So they did it with mouse pups , kittens .
And by the way , the reason the kittens here are orange and these are green is because that &apos;s a bioluminescent gene from coral , while this is from jellyfish .
They did it with pigs .
They did it with puppies .
And , in fact , they did it with monkeys .
And if you can do it with monkeys -- though the great leap in trying to genetically manipulate is actually between monkeys and apes -- if they can do it in monkeys , they can probably figure out how to do it in apes , which means they can do it in human beings .
In other words , it is theoretically possible that before too long we will be biotechnologically capable of creating human beings that glow in the dark .
Be easier to find us at night .
And in fact , right now in many states , you can go out and you can buy bioluminescent pets .
These are zebra fish . They &apos;re normally black and silver .
These are zebra fish that have been genetically engineered to be yellow , green , red , and they are actually available now in certain states .
Other states have banned them .
Nobody knows what to do with these kinds of creatures .
There is no area of the government -- not the EPA or the FDA -- that controls genetically-engineered pets .
And so some states have decided to allow them , some states have decided to ban them .
Some of you may have read about the FDA &apos;s consideration right now of genetically-engineered salmon .
The salmon on top is a genetically engineered Chinook salmon , using a gene from these salmon and from one other fish that we eat , to make it grow much faster using a lot less feed .
And right now the FDA is trying to make a final decision on whether , pretty soon , you could be eating this fish -- it &apos;ll be sold in the stores .
And before you get too worried about it , here in the United States , the majority of food you buy in the supermarket already has genetically-modified components to it .
So even as we worry about it , we have allowed it to go on in this country -- much different in Europe -- without any regulation , and even without any identification on the package .
These are all the first cloned animals of their type .
So in the lower right here , you have Dolly , the first cloned sheep -- now happily stuffed in a museum in Edinburgh ; Ralph the rat , the first cloned rat ; CC the cat , for cloned cat ; Snuppy , the first cloned dog -- Snuppy for Seoul National University puppy -- created in South Korea by the very same man that some of you may remember had to end up resigning in disgrace because he claimed he had cloned a human embryo , which he had not .
He actually was the first person to clone a dog , which is a very difficult thing to do , because dog genomes are very plastic .
This is Prometea , the first cloned horse .
It &apos;s a Haflinger horse cloned in Italy , a real &quot; gold ring &quot; of cloning , because there are many horses that win important races who are geldings .
In other words , the equipment to put them out to stud has been removed .
But if you can clone that horse , you can have both the advantage of having a gelding run in the race and his identical genetic duplicate can then be put out to stud .
These were the first cloned calves , the first cloned grey wolves , and then , finally , the first cloned piglets : Alexis , Chista , Carrel , Janie and Dotcom .
In addition , we &apos;ve started to use cloning technology to try to save endangered species .
This is the use of animals now to create drugs and other things in their bodies that we want to create .
So with antithrombin in that goat -- that goat has been genetically modified so that the molecules of its milk actually include the molecule of antithrombin that GTC Genetics wants to create .
And then in addition , transgenic pigs , knockout pigs , from the National Institute of Animal Science in South Korea , to try to create all kinds of drugs and other industrial types of chemicals that they want the blood and the milk of these animals to produce for them , instead of producing them in an industrial way .
These are two creatures that were created in order to save endangered species .
The guar is an endangered Southeast Asian ungulate .
A somatic cell , a body cell , was taken from its body , gestated in the ovum of a cow , and then that cow gave birth to a guar .
Same thing happened with the mouflon , where it &apos;s an endangered species of sheep .
It was gestated in a regular sheep body , which actually raises an interesting biological problem .
We have two kinds of DNA in our bodies .
We have our nucleic DNA that everybody thinks of as our DNA , but we also have DNA in our mitochondria , which are the energy packets of the cell .
That DNA is passed down through our mothers .
So really , what you end up having here is not a guar and not a mouflon , but a guar with cow mitochondria , and therefore cow mitochondrial DNA , and a mouflon with another species of sheep &apos;s mitochondrial DNA .
These are really hybrids , not pure animals .
And it raises the question of how we &apos;re going to define animal species in the age of biotechnology -- a question that we &apos;re not really sure yet how to solve .
This lovely creature is an Asian cockroach .
And what they &apos;ve done here is they &apos;ve put electrodes in its ganglia and its brain and then a transmitter on top , and it &apos;s on a big computer tracking ball .
And now , using a joystick , they can send this creature around the lab and control whether it goes left or right , forwards or backwards .
They &apos;ve created a kind of insect bot , or bugbot .
It gets worse than that -- or perhaps better than that .
This actually is one of DARPA &apos;s very important -- DARPA is the Defense Research Agency -- one of their projects .
These goliath beetles are wired in their wings .
They have a computer chip strapped to their backs , and they can fly these creatures around the lab .
They can make them go left , right . They can make them take off .
They can &apos;t actually make them land .
They put them about one inch above the ground , and then they shut everything off and they go pfft .
But it &apos;s the closest they can get to a landing .
And in fact , this technology has gotten so developed that this creature -- this is a moth -- this is the moth in its pupa stage , and that &apos;s when they put the wires in and they put in the computer technology , so that when the moth actually emerges as a moth , it is already prewired .
The wires are already in its body , and they can just hook it up to their technology , and now they &apos;ve got these bugbots that they can send out for surveillance .
They can put little cameras on them and perhaps someday deliver other kinds of ordinance to warzones .
It &apos;s not just insects .
This is the ratbot , or the robo-rat by Sanjiv Talwar at SUNY Downstate .
Again , it &apos;s got technology -- it &apos;s got electrodes going into its left and right hemispheres ; it &apos;s got a camera on top of its head .
The scientists can make this creature go left , right .
They have it running through mazes , controlling where it &apos;s going .
They &apos;ve now created an organic robot .
The graduate students in Sanjiv Talwar &apos;s lab said , &quot; Is this ethical ?
We &apos;ve taken away the autonomy of this animal . &quot;
I &apos;ll get back to that in a minute .
There &apos;s also been work done with monkeys .
This is Miguel Nicolelis of Duke .
He took owl monkeys , wired them up so that a computer watched their brains while they moved , especially looking at the movement of their right arm .
The computer learned what the monkey brain did to move its arm in various ways .
They then hooked it up to a prosthetic arm , which you see here in the picture , put the arm in another room .
Pretty soon , the computer learned , by reading the monkey &apos;s brainwaves , to make that arm in the other room do whatever the monkey &apos;s arm did .
Then he put a video monitor in the monkey &apos;s cage that showed the monkey this prosthetic arm , and the monkey got fascinated .
The monkey recognized that whatever she did with her arm , this prosthetic arm would do .
And eventually she was moving it and moving it , and eventually stopped moving her right arm and , staring at the screen , could move the prosthetic arm in the other room only with her brainwaves -- which means that monkey became the first primate in the history of the world to have three independent functional arms .
And it &apos;s not just technology that we &apos;re putting into animals .
This is Thomas DeMarse at the University of Florida .
He took 20,000 and then 60,000 disaggregated rat neurons -- so these are just individual neurons from rats -- put them on a chip .
They self-aggregated into a network , became an integrated chip .
And he used that as the IT piece of a mechanism which ran a flight simulator .
So now we have organic computer chips made out of living , self-aggregating neurons .
Finally , Mussa-Ivaldi of Northwestern took a completely intact , independent lamprey eel brain .
This is a brain from a lamprey eel .
It is living -- fully-intact brain in a nutrient medium with these electrodes going off to the sides , attached photosensitive sensors to the brain , put it into a cart -- here &apos;s the cart , the brain is sitting there in the middle -- and using this brain as the sole processor for this cart , when you turn on a light and shine it at the cart , the cart moves toward the light ; when you turn it off , it moves away .
It &apos;s photophilic .
So now we have a complete living lamprey eel brain .
Is it thinking lamprey eel thoughts , sitting there in its nutrient medium ?
I don &apos;t know , but in fact it is a fully living brain that we have managed to keep alive to do our bidding .
So , we are now at the stage where we are creating creatures for our own purposes .
This is a mouse created by Charles Vacanti of the University of Massachusetts .
He altered this mouse so that it was genetically engineered to have skin that was less immunoreactive to human skin , put a polymer scaffolding of an ear under it and created an ear that could then be taken off the mouse and transplanted onto a human being .
Genetic engineering coupled with polymer physiotechnology coupled with xenotransplantation .
This is where we are in this process .
Finally , not that long ago , Craig Venter created the first artificial cell , where he took a cell , took a DNA synthesizer , which is a machine , created an artificial genome , put it in a different cell -- the genome was not of the cell he put it in -- and that cell then reproduced as the other cell .
In other words , that was the first creature in the history of the world that had a computer as its parent -- it did not have an organic parent .
And so , asks The Economist : &quot; The first artificial organism and its consequences . &quot;
So you may have thought that the creation of life was going to happen in something that looked like that .
But in fact , that &apos;s not what Frankenstein &apos;s lab looks like .
This is what Frankenstein &apos;s lab looks like .
This is a DNA synthesizer , and here at the bottom are just bottles of A , T , C and G -- the four chemicals that make up our DNA chain .
And so , we need to ask ourselves some questions .
For the first time in the history of this planet , we are able to directly design organisms .
We can manipulate the plasmas of life with unprecedented power , and it confers on us a responsibility .
Is everything okay ?
Is it okay to manipulate and create whatever creatures we want ?
Do we have free reign to design animals ?
Do we get to go someday to Pets &apos; R &apos; Us and say , &quot; Look , I want a dog .
I &apos;d like it to have the head of a Dachshund , the body of a retriever , maybe some pink fur , and let &apos;s make it glow in the dark &quot; ?
Does industry get to create creatures who , in their milk , in their blood , and in their saliva and other bodily fluids , create the drugs and industrial molecules we want and then warehouse them as organic manufacturing machines ?
Do we get to create organic robots , where we remove the autonomy from these animals and turn them just into our playthings ?
And then the final step of this , once we perfect these technologies in animals and we start using them in human beings , what are the ethical guidelines that we will use then ?
It &apos;s already happening . It &apos;s not science fiction .
We are not only already using these things in animals , some of them we &apos;re already beginning to use on our own bodies .
We are now taking control of our own evolution .
We are directly designing the future of the species of this planet .
It confers upon us an enormous responsibility that is not just the responsibility of the scientists and the ethicists who are thinking about it and writing about it now .
It is the responsibility of everybody because it will determine what kind of planet and what kind of bodies we will have in the future .
Thanks .
P√©ter Fankhauser : Meet Rezero , the dancing ballbot
Engineering student P√©ter Fankhauser demonstrates Rezero , a robot that balances on a ball . Designed and built by students , Rezero is the first ballbot made to move quickly and gracefully -- and even dance .
Let me introduce to you Rezero .
This little fellow was developed by a group of 10 undergraduate students at the Autonomous Systems Laboratory at ETH-Zurich .
Our robot belongs to a family of robots called Ballbots .
Instead of wheels , a Ballbot is balancing and moving on one single ball .
The main characteristics of such a system is that there &apos;s one sole contact point to the ground .
This means that the robot is inherently unstable .
It &apos;s like when I am trying to stand on one foot .
You might ask yourself , what &apos;s the usefulness of a robot that &apos;s unstable ?
Now we &apos;ll explain that in a second .
Let me first explain how Rezero actually keeps his balance .
Rezero keeps his balance by constantly measuring his pitch angle with a sensor .
He then counteracts and avoids toppling over by turning the motors appropriately .
This happens 160 times per second , and if anything fails in this process , Rezero would immediately fall to the ground .
Now to move and to balance , Rezero needs to turn the ball .
The ball is driven by three special wheels that allow Rezero to move into any direction and also move around his own axis at the same time .
Due to his instability , Rezero is always in motion . Now here &apos;s the trick .
It &apos;s indeed exactly this instability that allows a robot to move very &#91; dynamically &#93; .
Let &apos;s play a little .
You may have wondered what happens if I give the robot a little push .
In this mode , he &apos;s trying to maintain his position .
For the next demo , I &apos;d like you to introduce to my colleagues Michael , on the computer , and Thomas who &apos;s helping me onstage .
In the next mode , Rezero is passive , and we can move him around .
With almost no force I can control his position and his velocity .
I can also make him spin .
In the next mode , we can get Rezero to follow a person .
He &apos;s now keeping a constant distance to Thomas .
This works with a laser sensor that &apos;s mounted on top of Rezero .
With the same method , we can also get him to circle a person .
We call this the orbiting mode .
All right , thank you , Thomas .
Now , what &apos;s the use of this technology ?
For now , it &apos;s an experiment , but let me show you some possible future applications .
Rezero could be used in exhibitions or parks .
With a screen it could inform people or show them around in a fun and entertaining way .
In a hospital , this device could be used to carry around medical equipment .
Due to the Ballbot system , it has a very small footprint and it &apos;s also easy to move around .
And of course , who wouldn &apos;t like to take a ride on one of these .
And these are more practical applications .
But there &apos;s also a certain beauty within this technology .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Deborah Rhodes : A test that finds 3x more breast tumors , and why it &apos;s not available to you
Working with a team of physicists , Dr. Deborah Rhodes developed a new tool for tumor detection that &apos;s 3 times as effective as traditional mammograms for women with dense breast tissue . The life-saving implications are stunning . So why haven &apos;t we heard of it ? Rhodes shares the story behind the tool &apos;s creation , and the web of politics and economics that keep it from mainstream use .
There are two groups of women when it comes to screening mammography -- women in whom mammography works very well and has saved thousands of lives and women in whom it doesn &apos;t work well at all .
Do you know which group you &apos;re in ?
If you don &apos;t , you &apos;re not alone .
Because the breast has become are very political organ .
The truth has become lost in all the rhetoric coming from the press , politicians , radiologists and medical imaging companies .
I will do my best this morning to tell you what I think is the truth .
But first , my disclosures .
I am not a breast cancer survivor .
I &apos;m not a radiologist .
I don &apos;t have any patents , and I &apos;ve never received any money from a medical imaging company , and I am not seeking your vote .
What I am is a doctor of internal medicine who became passionately interested in this topic about 10 years ago when a patient asked me a question .
She came to see me after discovering a breast lump .
Her sister had been diagnosed with breast cancer in her 40s .
She and I were both very pregnant at that time , and my heart just ached for her , imagining how afraid she must be .
Fortunately , her lump proved to be benign .
But she asked me a question : how confident was I that I would find a tumor early on her mammogram if she developed one ?
So I studied her mammogram , and I reviewed the radiology literature , and I was shocked to discover that , in her case , our chances of finding a tumor early on the mammogram were less than the toss of a coin .
You may recall a year ago when a firestorm erupted after the United States Preventive Services Task Force reviewed the world &apos;s mammography screening literature and issued a guideline recommending against screening mammograms in women in their 40s .
Now everybody rushed to criticize the Task Force , even though most of them weren &apos;t in anyway familiar with the mammography studies .
It took the Senate just 17 days to ban the use of the guidelines in determining insurance coverage .
Radiologists were outraged by the guidelines .
The pre-eminent mammographer in the United States issued the following quote to the Washington Post .
The radiologists were , in turn , criticized for protecting their own financial self-interest .
But in my view , the radiologists are heroes .
There &apos;s a shortage of radiologists qualified to read mammograms , and that &apos;s because mammograms are one of the most complex of all radiology studies to interpret , and because radiologists are sued more often over missed breast cancer than any other cause .
But that very fact is telling .
Where there is this much legal smoke , there is likely to be some fire .
The factor most responsible for that fire is breast density .
Breast density refers to the relative amount of fat -- pictured here in yellow -- versus connective and epithelial tissues -- pictured in pink .
And that proportion is primarily genetically determined .
Two-thirds of women in their 40s have dense breast tissue , which is why mammography doesn &apos;t work as well in them .
And although breast density generally declines with age , up to a third of women retain dense breast tissue for years after menopause .
So how do you know if your breasts are dense ?
Well , you need to read the details of your mammography report .
Radiologists classify breast density into four categories based on the appearance of the tissue on a mammogram .
If the breast is less than 25 percent dense , that &apos;s called fatty-replaced .
The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities , followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense .
And breasts that fall into these two categories are considered dense .
The problem with breast density is that it &apos;s truly the wolf in sheep &apos;s clothing .
Both tumors and dense breast tissue appear white on a mammogram , and the X-ray often can &apos;t distinguish between the two .
So it &apos;s easy to see this tumor in the upper part of this fatty breast .
But imagine how difficult it would be to find that tumor in this dense breast .
That &apos;s why mammograms find over 80 percent of tumors in fatty breasts , but as few as 40 percent in extremely dense breasts .
Now it &apos;s bad enough that breast density makes it hard to find a cancer , but it turns out that it &apos;s also a powerful predictor of your risk for breast cancer .
It &apos;s a stronger risk factor than having a mother or a sister with breast cancer .
At the time my patient posed this question to me , breast density was an obscure topic in the radiology literature , and very few women having mammograms , or the physicians ordering them , knew about this .
But what else could I offer her ?
Mammograms have been around since the 1960 &apos;s , and it &apos;s changed very little .
There have been surprisingly few innovations , until digital mammography was approved in 2000 .
Digital mammography is still an X-ray of the breast , but the images can be stored and manipulated digitally , just like we can with a digital camera .
The U.S. has invested four billion dollars converting to digital mammography equipment , and what have we gained from that investment ?
In a study funded by over 25 million taxpayer dollars , digital mammography was found to be no better over all than traditional mammography , and in fact , it was worse in older women .
But it was better in one group , and that was women under 50 who were pre-menopausal and had dense breasts , and in those women , digital mammography found twice as many cancers , but it still only found 60 percent .
So digital mammography has been a giant leap forward for manufacturers of digital mammography equipment , but it &apos;s been a very small step forward for womankind .
What about ultrasound ?
Ultrasound generates more biopsies that are unnecessary relative to other technologies , so it &apos;s not widely used .
And MRI is exquisitely sensitive for finding tumors , but it &apos;s also very expensive .
If we think about disruptive technology , we see an almost ubiquitous pattern of the technology getting smaller and less expensive .
Think about iPods compared to stereos .
But it &apos;s the exact opposite in health care .
The machines get ever bigger and ever more expensive .
Screening the average young woman with an MRI is kind of like driving to the grocery store in a Hummer .
It &apos;s just way too much equipment .
One MRI scan costs 10 times what a digital mammogram costs .
And sooner or later , we &apos;re going to have to accept the fact that health care innovation can &apos;t always come at a much higher price .
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker on innovation , and he made the case that scientific discoveries are rarely the product of one individual &apos;s genius .
Rather , big ideas can be orchestrated , if you can simply gather people with different perspectives in a room and get them to talk about things that they don &apos;t ordinarily talk about .
It &apos;s like the essence of TED .
He quotes one innovator who says , &quot; The only time a physician and a physicist get together is when the physicist gets sick . &quot;
This makes no sense , because physicians have all kinds of problems that they don &apos;t realize have solutions .
And physicists have all kinds of solutions for things that they don &apos;t realize are problems .
Now , take a look at this cartoon that accompanied Gladwell &apos;s article , and tell me if you see something disturbing about this depiction of innovative thinkers .
So if you will allow me a little creative license , I will tell you the story of the serendipitous collision of my patient &apos;s problem with a physicist &apos;s solution .
Shortly after her visit , I was introduced to a nuclear physicist at Mayo named Michael O &apos;Conner , who was a specialist in cardiac imaging , something I had nothing to do with .
And he happened to tell me about a conference he &apos;d just returned from in Israel , where they were talking about a new type of gamma detector .
Now gamma imaging has been around for a long time to image the heart , and it had even been tried to image the breast .
But the problem was that the gamma detectors were these huge , bulky tubes , and they were filled with these scintillating crystals , and you just couldn &apos;t get them close enough around the breast to find small tumors .
But the potential advantage was that gamma rays , unlike X-rays , are not influenced by breast density .
But this technology could not find tumors when they &apos;re small , and finding a small tumor is critical for survival .
If you can find a tumor when it &apos;s less than a centimeter , survival exceeds 90 percent , but drops off rapidly as tumor size increases .
But Michael told me about a new type of gamma detector that he &apos;d seen , and this is it .
It &apos;s made not of a bulky tube , but of a thin layer of a semiconductor material that serves as the gamma detector .
And I started talking to him about this problem with breast density , and we realized that we might be able to get this detector close enough around the breast to actually find small tumors .
So after putting together a grid of these cubes with tape -- -- Michael hacked off the X-ray plate of a mammography machine that was about to be thrown out , and we attached the new detector , and we decided to call this machine Molecular Breast Imaging , or MBI .
This is an image from our first patient .
And you can see , using the old gamma technology , that it just looked like noise .
But using our new detector , we could begin to see the outline of a tumor .
So here we were , a nuclear physicist , an internist , soon joined by Carrie Hruska , a biomedical engineer , and two radiologists , and we were trying to take on the entrenched world of mammography with a machine that was held together by duct tape .
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement , but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system .
This is our current detector .
And you can see that it looks a lot different .
The duct tape is gone , and we added a second detector on top of the breast , which has further improved our tumor detection .
So how does this work ?
The patient receives an injection of a radio tracer that &apos;s taken up by rapidly proliferating tumor cells , but not by normal cells , and this is the key difference from mammography .
Mammography relies on differences in the appearance of the tumor from the background tissue , and we &apos;ve seen that those differences can be obscured in a dense breast .
But MBI exploits the different molecular behavior of tumors , and therefore , it &apos;s impervious to breast density .
After the injection , the patient &apos;s breast is placed between the detectors .
And if you &apos;ve ever had a mammogram -- if you &apos;re old enough to have had a mammogram -- you know what comes next : pain .
You may be surprised to know that mammography is the only radiologic study that &apos;s regulated by federal law , and the law requires that the equivalent of a 40-pound car battery come down on your breast during this study .
But with MBI , we use just light , pain-free compression .
And the detector then transmits the image to the computer .
So here &apos;s an example .
You can see , on the right , a mammogram showing a faint tumor , the edges of which are blurred by the dense tissue .
But the MBI image shows that tumor much more clearly , as well as a second tumor , which profoundly influence that patient &apos;s surgical options .
In this example , although the mammogram found one tumor , we were able to demonstrate three discrete tumors -- one is small as three millimeters .
Our big break came in 2004 .
After we had demonstrated that we could find small tumors , we used these images to submit a grant to the Susan G. Komen Foundation .
And we were elated when they took a chance on a team of completely unknown investigators and funded us to study 1,000 women with dense breasts , comparing a screening mammogram to an MBI .
Of the tumors that we found , mammography found only 25 percent of those tumors .
MBI found 83 percent .
Here &apos;s an example from that screening study .
The digital mammogram was read as normal and shows lots of dense tissue , but the MBI shows an area of intense uptake , which correlated with a two-centimeter tumor .
In this case , a one-centimeter tumor .
And in this case , a 45-year-old medical secretary at Mayo , who had lost her mother to breast cancer when she was very young , wanted to enroll in our study .
And her mammogram showed an area of very dense tissue , but her MBI showed an area of worrisome uptake , which we can also see on a color image .
And this corresponded to a tumor the size of a golf ball .
But fortunately it was removed before it had spread to her lymph nodes .
So now that we knew that this technology could find three times more tumors in a dense breast , we had to solve one very important problem .
We had to figure out how to lower the radiation dose , and we have spent the last three years making modifications to every aspect of the imaging system to allow this .
And I &apos;m very happy to report that we &apos;re now using a dose of radiation that is equivalent to the effective dose from one digital mammogram .
And at this low dose , we &apos;re continuing this screening study , and this image from three weeks ago in a 67-year-old woman shows a normal digital mammogram , but an MBI image showing an uptake that proved to be a large cancer .
So this is not just young women that it &apos;s benefiting .
It &apos;s also older women with dense tissue .
And we &apos;re now routinely using one-fifth the radiation dose that &apos;s used in any other type of gamma technology .
MBI generates four images per breast .
MRI generates over a thousand .
It takes a radiologist years of specialty training to become expert in differentiating the normal anatomic detail from the worrisome finding .
But I suspect even the non-radiologists in the room can find the tumor on the MBI image .
But this is why MBI is so potentially disruptive -- it &apos;s as accurate as MRI , and it &apos;s a fraction of the cost .
But you can understand why there may be forces in the breast-imaging world who prefer the status quo .
After achieving what we felt were remarkable results , our manuscript was rejected by four journals .
After the fourth rejection , we requested reconsideration of the manuscript , because we strongly suspected that one of the reviewers who had rejected it had a financial conflict of interest in a competing technology .
Our manuscript was then accepted and will be published later this month in the journal Radiology .
We still need to complete the screening study using the low dose , and then our findings will need to be replicated at other institutions , and this could take five or more years .
If this technology is widely adopted , I will not benefit financially in any way , and that is very important to me , because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth .
But I recognize -- I recognize that the adoption of this technology will depend as much on economic and political forces as it will on the soundness of the science .
The MBI unit has now been FDA approved , but it &apos;s not yet widely available .
So until something is available for women with dense breasts , there are things that you should know to protect yourself .
First , know your density .
Ninety percent of women don &apos;t , and 95 percent of women don &apos;t know that it increases your breast cancer risk .
The State of Connecticut became the first and only state to mandate that women receive notification of their breast density after a mammogram .
I was at a conference of 60,000 people in breast-imaging last week in Chicago , and I was stunned that there was a heated debate as to whether we should be telling women what their breast density is .
Of course we should .
And if you don &apos;t know , please ask your doctor or read the details of your mammography report .
Second , if you &apos;re pre-menopausal , try to schedule your mammogram in the first two weeks of your menstrual cycle , when breast density is relatively lower .
Third , if you notice a persistent change in your breast , insist on additional imaging .
And fourth and most important , the mammography debate will rage on , but I do believe that all women 40 and older should have an annual mammogram .
Mammography isn &apos;t perfect , but it &apos;s the only test that &apos;s been proven to reduce mortality from breast cancer .
But this mortality banner is the very sword which mammography &apos;s most ardent advocates use to deter innovation .
Some women who develop breast cancer die from it many years later , and most women , thankfully , survive .
So it takes 10 or more years for any screening method to demonstrate a reduction in mortality from breast cancer .
Mammography &apos;s the only one that &apos;s been around long enough to have a chance of making that claim .
It is time for us to accept both the extraordinary successes of mammography and the limitations .
We need to individualize screening based on density .
For women without dense breasts , mammography is the best choice .
But for women with dense breasts ; we shouldn &apos;t abandon screening altogether , we need to offer them something better .
The babies that we were carrying when my patient first asked me this question are now both in middle school , and the answer has been so slow to come .
She &apos;s given me her blessing to share this story with you .
After undergoing biopsies that further increased her risk for cancer and losing her sister to cancer , she made the difficult decision to have a prophylactic mastectomy .
We can and must do better , not just in time for her granddaughters and my daughters , but in time for you .
Thank you .
Pranav Mistry : The thrilling potential of SixthSense technology
At TEDIndia , Pranav Mistry demos several tools that help the physical world interact with the world of data -- including a deep look at his SixthSense device and a new , paradigm-shifting paper &quot; laptop . &quot; In an onstage Q &amp; amp ; A , Mistry says he &apos;ll open-source the software behind SixthSense , to open its possibilities to all .
We grew up interacting with the physical objects around us .
There are an enormous number of them that we use every day .
Unlike most of our computing devices , these objects are much more fun to use .
When you talk about objects , one other thing automatically comes attached to that thing , and that is gestures : how we manipulate these objects , how we use these objects in everyday life .
We use gestures not only to interact with these objects , but we also use them to interact with each other .
A gesture of &quot; Namaste ! &quot; , maybe , to respect someone , or maybe -- in India I don &apos;t need to teach a kid that this means &quot; four runs &quot; in cricket .
It comes as a part of our everyday learning .
So , I am very interested , from the beginning , that how -- how our knowledge about everyday objects and gestures , and how we use these objects , can be leveraged to our interactions with the digital world .
Rather than using a keyboard and mouse , why can I not use my computer in the same way that I interact in the physical world ?
So , I started this exploration around eight years back , and it literally started with a mouse on my desk .
Rather than using it for my computer , I actually opened it .
Most of you might be aware that , in those days , the mouse used to come with a ball inside , and there were two rollers that actually guide the computer where the ball is moving , and , accordingly , where the mouse is moving .
So , I was interested in these two rollers , and I actually wanted more , so I borrowed another mouse from a friend -- never returned to him -- and I now had four rollers .
Interestingly , what I did with these rollers is , basically , I took them off of these mouses and then put them in one line .
It had some strings and pulleys and some springs .
What I got is basically a gesture interface device that actually acts as a motion-sensing device made for two dollars .
So , here , whatever movement I do in my physical world is actually replicated inside the digital world just using this small device that I made , around eight years back , in 2000 .
Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds , I thought of sticky notes .
I thought , &quot; Why can I not connect the normal interface of a physical sticky note to the digital world ? &quot;
A message written on a sticky note to my mom on paper can come to an SMS , or maybe a meeting reminder automatically syncs with my digital calendar -- a to-do list that automatically syncs with you .
But you can also search in the digital world , or maybe you can write a query , saying , &quot; What is Dr. Smith &apos;s address ? &quot;
and this small system actually prints it out -- so it actually acts like a paper input-output system , just made out of paper .
In another exploration , I thought of making a pen that can draw in three dimensions .
So , I implemented this pen that can help designers and architects not only think in three dimensions , but they can actually draw so that it &apos;s more intuitive to use that way .
Then I thought , &quot; Why not make a Google Map , but in the physical world ? &quot;
Rather than typing a keyword to find something , I put my objects on top of it .
If I put a boarding pass , it will show me where the flight gate is .
A coffee cup will show where you can find more coffee , or where you can trash the cup .
So , these were some of the earlier explorations I did because the goal was to connect these two worlds seamlessly .
Among all these experiments , there was one thing in common : I was trying to bring a part of the physical world to the digital world .
I was taking some part of the objects , or any of the intuitiveness of real life , and bringing them to the digital world , because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive .
But then I realized that we humans are not actually interested in computing .
What we are interested in is information .
We want to know about things .
We want to know about dynamic things going around .
So I thought , around last year -- in the beginning of the last year -- I started thinking , &quot; Why can I not take this approach in the reverse way ? &quot;
Maybe , &quot; How about I take my digital world and paint the physical world with that digital information ? &quot;
Because pixels are actually , right now , confined in these rectangular devices that fit in our pockets .
Why can I not remove this confine and take that to my everyday objects , everyday life so that I don &apos;t need to learn the new language for interacting with those pixels ?
So , in order to realize this dream , I actually thought of putting a big-size projector on my head .
I think that &apos;s why this is called a head-mounted projector , isn &apos;t it ?
I took it very literally , and took my bike helmet , put a little cut over there so that the projector actually fits nicely .
So now , what I can do -- I can augment the world around me with this digital information .
But later , I realized that I actually wanted to interact with those digital pixels , also .
So I put a small camera over there , that acts as a digital eye .
Later , we moved to a much better , consumer-oriented pendant version of that , that many of you now know as the SixthSense device .
But the most interesting thing about this particular technology is that you can carry your digital world with you wherever you go .
You can start using any surface , any wall around you , as an interface .
The camera is actually tracking all your gestures .
Whatever you &apos;re doing with your hands , it &apos;s understanding that gesture .
And , actually , if you see , there are some color markers that in the beginning version we are using with it .
You can start painting on any wall .
You stop by a wall , and start painting on that wall .
But we are not only tracking one finger , here .
We are giving you the freedom of using all of both of your hands , of a map just by pinching all present .
The camera is actually doing -- just , getting all the images -- is doing the edge recognition and also the color recognition and so many other small algorithms are going on inside .
So , technically , it &apos;s a little bit complex , but it gives you an output which is more intuitive to use , in some sense .
But I &apos;m more excited that you can actually take it outside .
Rather than getting your camera out of your pocket , you can just do the gesture of taking a photo and it takes a photo for you .
Thank you .
And later I can find a wall , anywhere , and start browsing those photos or maybe , &quot; OK , I want to modify this photo a little bit and send it as an email to a friend . &quot;
So , we are looking for an era where computing will actually merge with the physical world .
And , of course , if you don &apos;t have any surface , you can start using your palm for simple operations .
Here , I &apos;m dialing a phone number just using my hand .
The camera is actually not only understanding your hand movements , but , interestingly , is also able to understand what objects you are holding in your hand .
What we &apos;re doing here is actually -- for example , in this case , the book cover is matched with so many thousands , or maybe millions of books online , and checking out which book it is .
Once it has that information , it finds out more reviews about that , or maybe New York Times has a sound overview on that , so you can actually hear , on a physical book , a review as sound .
This was Obama &apos;s visit last week to MIT .
So , I was seeing the live &#91; video &#93; of his talk , outside , on just a newspaper .
Your newspaper will show you live weather information rather than having it updated -- like , you have to check your computer in order to do that , right ?
When I &apos;m going back , I can just use my boarding pass to check how much my flight has been delayed , because at that particular time , I &apos;m not feeling like opening my iPhone , and checking out a particular icon .
And I think this technology will not only change the way -- yes .
It will change the way we interact with people , also , not only the physical world .
The fun part is , I &apos;m going to the Boston metro , and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground , right ?
And I think the imagination is the only limit of what you can think of when this kind of technology merges with real life .
But many of you argue , actually , that all of our work is not only about physical objects .
We actually do lots of accounting and paper editing and all those kinds of things ; what about that ?
And many of you are excited about the next generation tablet computers to come out in the market .
So , rather than waiting for that , I actually made my own , just using a piece of paper .
So , what I did here is remove the camera -- All the webcam cameras have a microphone inside the camera .
I removed the microphone from that , and then just pinched that -- like I just made a clip out of the microphone -- and clipped that to a piece of paper , any paper that you found around .
So now the sound of the touch is getting me when exactly I &apos;m touching the paper .
But the camera is actually tracking where my fingers are moving .
You can of course watch movies .
and I am a Wilderness Explorer in Tribe 54 . &quot; ) And you can of course play games .
Here , the camera is actually understanding how you &apos;re holding the paper and playing a car-racing game .
Many of you already must have thought , OK , you can browse .
Yeah . Of course you can browse to any websites or you can do all sorts of computing on a piece of paper wherever you need it .
So , more interestingly , I &apos;m interested in how we can take that in a more dynamic way .
When I come back to my desk I can just pinch that information back to my desktop so I can use my full-size computer .
And why only computers ? We can just play with papers .
Paper world is interesting to play with .
Here , I &apos;m taking a part of a document and putting over here a second part from a second place -- and I &apos;m actually modifying the information that I have over there .
Yeah . And I say , &quot; OK , this looks nice , let me print it out , that thing . &quot;
So I now have a print-out of that thing , and now -- the workflow is more intuitive the way we used to do it maybe 20 years back , rather than now switching between these two worlds .
So , as a last thought , I think that integrating information to everyday objects will not only help us to get rid of the digital divide , the gap between these two worlds , but will also help us , in some way , to stay human , to be more connected to our physical world .
And it will actually help us not end up being machines sitting in front of other machines .
That &apos;s all . Thank you .
Thank you .
So , Pranav , first of all , you &apos;re a genius .
This is incredible , really .
What are you doing with this ? Is there a company being planned ?
Or is this research forever , or what ?
Pranav Mistry : So , there are lots of companies -- actually sponsor companies of Media Lab -- interested in taking this ahead in one or another way .
Companies like mobile phone operators want to take this in a different way than the NGOs in India , &#91; who &#93; are thinking , &quot; Why can we only have &apos; Sixth Sense &apos; ?
We should have a &apos; Fifth Sense &apos; for missing-sense people who cannot speak .
This technology can be used for them to speak out in a different way with maybe a speaker system . &quot;
What are your own plans ? Are you staying at MIT , or are you going to do something with this ?
PM : I &apos;m trying to make this more available to people so that anyone can develop their own SixthSense device , because the hardware is actually not that hard to manufacture or hard to make your own .
We will provide all the open source software for them , maybe starting next month .
Open source ? Wow .
Are you going to come back to India with some of this , at some point ?
PM : Yeah . Yes , yes , of course .
What are your plans ? MIT ?
India ? How are you going to split your time going forward ?
PM : There is a lot of energy here . Lots of learning .
All of this work that you have seen is all about my learning in India .
And now , if you see , it &apos;s more about the cost-effectiveness : this system costs you $ 300 compared to the $ 20,000 surface tables , or anything like that .
Or maybe even the $ 2 mouse gesture system at that time was costing around $ 5,000 ?
So , we actually -- I showed that , at a conference , to President Abdul Kalam , at that time , and then he said , &quot; OK , we should use this in Bhabha Atomic Research Centre for some use of that . &quot;
So I &apos;m excited about how I can bring the technology to the masses rather than just keeping that technology in the lab environment .
Based on the people we &apos;ve seen at TED , I would say you &apos;re truly one of the two or three best inventors in the world right now .
It &apos;s an honor to have you at TED .
Thank you so much .
That &apos;s fantastic .
Kevin Stone : The bio-future of joint replacement
Arthritis and injury grind down millions of joints , but few get the best remedy -- real biological tissue . Kevin Stone shows a treatment that could sidestep the high costs and donor shortfall of human-to-human transplants with a novel use of animal tissue .
So let me just start with my story .
So I tore my knee joint meniscus cartilage playing soccer in college .
Then I went on to tear my ACL , the ligament in my knee , and then developed an arthritic knee .
And I &apos;m sure that many of you in this audience have that same story , and , by the way , I married a woman who has exactly the same story .
So this motivated me to become an orthopedic surgeon and to see if I couldn &apos;t focus on solutions for those problems that would keep me playing sports and not limit me .
So with that , let me just show you a quick video to get you in the mood of what we &apos;re trying to explain .
We are all aware of the risk of cancer , but there &apos;s another disease that &apos;s destined to affect even more of us : arthritis .
Cancer may kill you , but when you look at the numbers , arthritis ruins more lives .
Assuming you live a long life , there &apos;s a 50 percent chance you &apos;ll develop arthritis .
And it &apos;s not just aging that causes arthritis .
Common injuries can lead to decades of pain , until our joints quite literally grind to a halt .
Desperate for a solution , we &apos;ve turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts , but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body , shouldn &apos;t we stop and ask if there &apos;s a better , more natural way ?
Let &apos;s consider an alternative path .
What if all the replacements our bodies need already exist in nature , or within our own stem cells ?
This is the field of biologic replacements , where we replace worn-out parts with new , natural ones .
Kevin Stone : And so , the mission is : how do I treat these things biologically ?
And let &apos;s talk about both what I did for my wife , and what I &apos;ve done for hundreds of other patients .
First thing for my wife , and the most common thing I hear from my patients , particularly in the 40- to 80-year-old age group , 70-year-old age group , is they come in and say , &quot; Hey , Doc , isn &apos;t there just a shock absorber you can put in my knee ?
I &apos;m not ready for joint replacement . &quot;
And so for her , I put in a human meniscus allograft donor right into that &#91; knee &#93; joint space .
And &#91; the allograft &#93; replaces &#91; the missing meniscus &#93; .
And then for that unstable ligament , we put in a human donor ligament to stabilize the knee .
And then for the damaged arthritis on the surface , we did a stem cell paste graft , which we designed in 1991 , to regrow that articular cartilage surface and give it back a smooth surface there .
So here &apos;s my wife &apos;s bad knee on the left , and her just hiking now four months later in Aspen , and doing well .
And it works , not just for my wife , but certainly for other patients .
The girl on the video , Jen Hudak , just won the Superpipe in Aspen just nine months after having destroyed her knee , as you see in the other image -- and having a paste graft to that knee .
And so we can regrow these surfaces biologically .
So with all this success , why isn &apos;t that good enough , you might ask .
Well the reason is because there &apos;s not enough donor cycles .
There &apos;s not enough young , healthy people falling off their motorcycle and donating that tissue to us .
And the tissue &apos;s very expensive .
And so that &apos;s not going to be a solution that &apos;s going to get us global with biologic tissue .
But the solution is animal tissue because it &apos;s plentiful , it &apos;s cheap , you can get it from young , healthy tissues , but the barrier is immunology .
And the specific barrier is a specific epitope called the galactosyl , or gal epitope .
So if we &apos;re going to transplant animal tissues to people , we have to figure out a way to get rid of that epitope .
So my story in working with animal tissues starts in 1984 .
And I started first with cow Achilles tendon , where we would take the cow Achilles tendon , which is type-I collagen , strip it of its antigens by degrading it with an acid and detergent wash and forming it into a regeneration template .
We would then take that regeneration template and insert it into the missing meniscus cartilage to regrow that in a patient &apos;s knee .
We &apos;ve now done that procedure , and it &apos;s been done worldwide in over 4,000 cases , so it &apos;s an FDA-approved and worldwide-accepted way to regrow the meniscus .
And that &apos;s great when I can degrade the tissue .
But what happens for your ligament when I need an intact ligament ?
I can &apos;t grind it up in a blender .
So in that case , I have to design -- and we designed with Uri Galili and Tom Turek -- an enzyme wash to wash away , or strip , those galactosyl epitopes with a specific enzyme .
And we call that a &quot; gal stripping &quot; technique .
What we do is humanize the tissue .
It &apos;s by gal stripping that tissue we humanize it , and then we can put it back into a patient &apos;s knee .
And we &apos;ve done that . Now we &apos;ve taken pig ligament -- young , healthy , big tissue , put it into 10 patients in an FDA-approved trial -- and then one of our patients went on to have three Canadian Masters Downhill championships -- on his &quot; pig-lig , &quot; as he calls it . So we know it can work .
And there &apos;s a wide clinical trial of this tissue now pending .
So what about the next step ?
What about getting to a total biologic knee replacement , not just the parts ?
How are we going to revolutionize artificial joint replacement ?
Well here &apos;s how we &apos;re going to do it .
So what we &apos;re going to do is take an articular cartilage from a young , healthy pig , strip it of its antigens , load it with your stem cells , then put it back on to that arthritic surface in your knee , tack it on there , have you heal that surface and then create a new biologic surface for your knee .
So that &apos;s our biologic approach right now .
We &apos;re going to rebuild your knee with the parts .
We &apos;re going to resurface it with a completely new surface .
But we have other advantages from the animal kingdom .
There &apos;s a benefit of 400 million years of ambulation .
We can harness those benefits .
We can use thicker , younger , better tissues than you might have injured in your knee , or that you might have when you &apos;re 40 , 50 or 60 .
We can do it as an outpatient procedure .
We can strip that tissue very economically , and so this is how we can get biologic knee replacement to go global .
And so welcome to super biologics .
It &apos;s not hardware .
It &apos;s not software .
It &apos;s bioware .
It &apos;s version 2.0 of you .
And so with that , coming to a -- coming to an operating theater near you soon , I believe .
Thank you very much .
Marcel Dicke : Why not eat insects ?
Marcel Dicke makes an appetizing case for adding insects to everyone &apos;s diet . His message to squeamish chefs and foodies : delicacies like locusts and caterpillars compete with meat in flavor , nutrition and eco-friendliness .
Okay , I &apos;m going to show you again something about our diets .
And I would like to know what the audience is , and so who of you ever ate insects ?
That &apos;s quite a lot .
But still , you &apos;re not representing the overall population of the Earth .
Because there &apos;s 80 percent out there that really eats insects .
But this is quite good .
Why not eat insects ? Well first , what are insects ?
Insects are animals that walk around on six legs .
And here you see just a selection .
There &apos;s six million species of insects on this planet , six million species .
There &apos;s a few hundreds of mammals -- six million species of insects .
In fact , if we count all the individual organisms , we would come at much larger numbers .
In fact , of all animals on Earth , of all animal species , 80 percent walks on six legs .
But if we would count all the individuals , and we take an average weight of them , it would amount to something like 200 to 2,000 kilograms for each of you and me on Earth .
That means that in terms of biomass , insects are more abundant than we are , and we &apos;re not on a planet of men , but we &apos;re on a planet of insects .
Insects are not only there in nature , but they also are involved in our economy , usually without us knowing .
There was an estimation , a conservative estimation , a couple of years ago that the U.S. economy benefited by 57 billion dollars per year .
It &apos;s a number -- very large -- a contribution to the economy of the United States for free .
And so I looked up what the economy was paying for the war in Iraq in the same year .
It was 80 billion U.S. dollars .
Well we know that that was not a cheap war .
So insects , just for free , contribute to the economy of the United States with about the same order of magnitude , just for free , without everyone knowing .
And not only in the States , but in any country , in any economy .
What do they do ?
They remove dung , they pollinate our crops .
A third of all the fruits that we eat are all a result of insects taking care of the reproduction of plants .
They control pests , and they &apos;re food for animals .
They &apos;re at the start of food chains .
Small animals eat insects .
Even larger animals eat insects .
But the small animals that eat insects are being eaten by larger animals , still larger animals .
And at the end of the food chain , we are eating them as well .
There &apos;s quite a lot of people that are eating insects .
And here you see me in a small , provincial town in China , Lijiang -- about two million inhabitants .
If you go out for dinner , like in a fish restaurant , where you can select which fish you want to eat , you can select which insects you would like to eat .
And they prepare it in a wonderful way .
And here you see me enjoying a meal with caterpillars , locusts , bee pupae -- delicacies .
And you can eat something new everyday .
There &apos;s more than 1,000 species of insects that are being eaten all around the globe .
That &apos;s quite a bit more than just a few mammals that we &apos;re eating , like a cow or a pig or a sheep .
More than 1,000 species -- an enormous variety .
And now you may think , okay , in this provincial town in China they &apos;re doing that , but not us .
Well we &apos;ve seen already that quite some of you already ate insects maybe occasionally , but I can tell you that every one of you is eating insects , without any exception .
You &apos;re eating at least 500 grams per year .
What are you eating ?
Tomato soup , peanut butter , chocolate , noodles -- any processed food that you &apos;re eating contains insects , because insects are here all around us , and when they &apos;re out there in nature they &apos;re also in our crops .
Some fruits get some insect damage .
Those are the fruits , if they &apos;re tomato , that go to the tomato soup .
If they don &apos;t have any damage , they go to the grocery .
And that &apos;s your view of a tomato .
But there &apos;s tomatoes that end up in a soup , and as long as they meet the requirements of the food agency , there can be all kinds of things in there , no problem .
In fact , why would we put these balls in the soup , there &apos;s meat in there anyway ?
In fact , all our processed foods contain more proteins than we would be aware of .
So anything is a good protein source already .
Now you may say , &quot; Okay , so we &apos;re eating 500 grams just by accident . &quot;
We &apos;re even doing this on purpose .
In a lot of food items that we have -- I have only two items here on the slide -- pink cookies or surimi sticks or , if you like , Campari -- a lot of our food products that are of a red color are dyed with a natural dye .
The surimi sticks &#91; of &#93; crabmeat , or is being sold as crab meat , is white fish that &apos;s being dyed with cochineal .
Cochineal is a product of an insect that lives off these cacti .
It &apos;s being produced in large amounts , 150 to 180 metric tons per year in the Canary Islands in Peru , and it &apos;s big business .
One gram of cochineal costs about 30 euros .
One gram of gold is 30 euros .
So it &apos;s a very precious thing that we &apos;re using to dye our foods .
Now the situation in the world is going to change for you and me , for everyone on this Earth .
The human population is growing very rapidly and is growing exponentially .
Where , at the moment , we have something between six and seven billion people , it will grow to about nine billion in 2050 .
That means that we have a lot more mouths to feed , and this is something that worries more and more people .
There was an FAO conference last October that was completely devoted to this .
How are we going to feed this world ?
And if you look at the figures up there , it says that we have a third more mouths to feed , but we need an agricultural production increase of 70 percent .
And that &apos;s especially because this world population is increasing , and it &apos;s increasing , not only in numbers , but we &apos;re also getting wealthier , and anyone that gets wealthier starts to eat more and also starts to eat more meat .
And meat , in fact , is something that costs a lot of our agricultural production .
Our diet consists , &#91; in &#93; some part , of animal proteins , and at the moment , most of us here get it from livestock , from fish , from game .
And we eat quite a lot of it .
In the developed world it &apos;s on average 80 kilograms per person per year , which goes up to 120 in the United States and a bit lower in some other countries , but on average 80 kilograms per person per year .
In the developing world it &apos;s much lower .
It &apos;s 25 kilograms per person per year .
But it &apos;s increasing enormously .
In China in the last 20 years , it increased from 20 to 50 , and it &apos;s still increasing .
So if a third of the world population is going to increase its meat consumption from 25 to 80 on average , and a third of the world population is living in China and in India , we &apos;re having an enormous demand on meat .
And of course , we are not there to say that &apos;s only for us , it &apos;s not for them .
They have the same share that we have .
Now to start with , I should say that we are eating way too much meat in the Western world .
We could do with much , much less -- and I know , I &apos;ve been a vegetarian for a long time , and you can easily do without anything .
You &apos;ll get proteins in any kind of food anyway .
But then there &apos;s a lot of problems that come with meat production , and we &apos;re being faced with that more and more often .
The first problem that we &apos;re facing is human health .
Pigs are quite like us .
They &apos;re even models in medicine , and we can even transplant organs from a pig to a human .
That means that pigs also share diseases with us .
And a pig disease , a pig virus , and a human virus can both proliferate , and because of their kind of reproduction , they can combine and produce a new virus .
This has happened in the Netherlands in the 1990s during the classical swine fever outbreak .
You get a new disease that can be deadly .
We eat insects -- they &apos;re so distantly related from us that this doesn &apos;t happen .
So that &apos;s one point for insects .
And there &apos;s the conversion factor .
You take 10 kilograms of feed , you can get one kilogram of beef , but you can get nine kilograms of locust meat .
So if you would be an entrepreneur , what would you do ?
With 10 kilograms of input , you can get either one or nine kg. of output .
So far we &apos;re taking the one , or up to five kilograms of output .
We &apos;re not taking the bonus yet .
We &apos;re not taking the nine kilograms of output yet .
So that &apos;s two points for insects .
And there &apos;s the environment .
If we take 10 kilograms of food -- and it results in one kilogram of beef , the other nine kilograms are waste , and a lot of that is manure .
If you produce insects , you have less manure per kilogram of meat that you produce .
So less waste .
Furthermore , per kilogram of manure , you have much , much less ammonia and fewer greenhouse gases when you have insect manure So you have less waste , and the waste that you have is not as environmental malign as it is with cow dung .
So that &apos;s three points for insects .
Now there &apos;s a big &quot; if , &quot; of course , and it is if insects produce meat that is of good quality .
Well there have been all kinds of analyses and in terms of protein , or fat , or vitamins , it &apos;s very good .
In fact , it &apos;s comparable to anything we eat as meat at the moment .
And even in terms of calories , it is very good .
One kilogram of grasshoppers has the same amount of calories as 10 hot dogs , or six Big Macs .
So that &apos;s four points for insects .
I can go on , and I could make many more points for insects , but time doesn &apos;t allow this .
So the question is , why not eat insects ?
I gave you at least four arguments in favor .
We &apos;ll have to .
Even if you don &apos;t like it , you &apos;ll have to get used to this because at the moment , 70 percent of all our agricultural land is being used to produce livestock .
That &apos;s not only the land where the livestock is walking and feeding , but it &apos;s also other areas where the feed is being produced and being transported .
We can increase it a bit at the expense of rainforests , but there &apos;s a limitation very soon .
And if you remember that we need to increase agricultural production by 70 percent , we &apos;re not going to make it that way .
We could much better change from meat , from beef , to insects .
And then 80 percent of the world already eats insects , so we are just a minority -- in a country like the U.K. , the USA , the Netherlands , anywhere .
On the left-hand side , you see a market in Laos where they have abundantly present all kinds of insects that you choose for dinner for the night .
On the right-hand side you see a grasshopper .
So people there are eating them , not because they &apos;re hungry , but because they think it &apos;s a delicacy .
It &apos;s just very good food .
You can vary enormously .
It has many benefits .
In fact , we have delicacy that &apos;s very much like this grasshopper : shrimps , a delicacy being sold at a high price .
Who wouldn &apos;t like to eat a shrimp ?
There are a few people who don &apos;t like shrimp , but shrimp , or crabs , or crayfish , are very closely related .
They are delicacies .
In fact , a locust is a &quot; shrimp &quot; of the land , and it would make very good into our diet .
So why are we not eating insects yet ?
Well that &apos;s just a matter of mindset .
We &apos;re not used to it , and we see insects as these organisms that are very different from us .
That &apos;s why we &apos;re changing the perception of insects .
And I &apos;m working very hard with my colleague , Arnold van Huis , in telling people what insects are , what magnificent things they are , what magnificent jobs they do in nature .
And in fact , without insects , we would not be here in this room , because if the insects die out , we will soon die out as well .
If we die out , the insects will continue very happily .
So we have to get used to the idea of eating insects .
And some might think , well they &apos;re not yet available .
Well they are .
There are entrepreneurs in the Netherlands that produce them , and one of them is here in the audience , Marian Peeters , who &apos;s in the picture .
I predict that later this year , you &apos;ll get them in the supermarkets -- not visible , but as animal protein in the food .
And maybe by 2020 , you &apos;ll buy them just knowing that this is an insect that you &apos;re going to eat .
And they &apos;re being made in the most wonderful ways .
A Dutch chocolate maker .
So there &apos;s even a lot of design to it .
Well in the Netherlands , we have an innovative Minister of Agriculture , and she puts the insects on the menu in her restaurant in her ministry .
And when she got all the Ministers of Agriculture of the E.U.
over to the Hague recently , she went to a high-class restaurant , and they ate insects all together .
It &apos;s not something that is a hobby of mine .
It &apos;s really taken off the ground .
So why not eat insects ?
You should try it yourself .
A couple of years ago , we had 1,750 people all together in a square in Wageningen town , and they ate insects at the same moment , and this was still big , big news .
I think soon it will not be big news anymore when we all eat insects , because it &apos;s just a normal way of doing .
So you can try it yourself today , and I would say , enjoy .
And I &apos;m going to show to Bruno some first tries , and he can have the first bite .
Look at them first . Look at them first .
Marcel Dicke : It &apos;s all protein .
That &apos;s exactly the same &#91; one &#93; you saw in the video actually .
And it looks delicious .
They just make it &#91; with &#93; nuts or something .
MD : Thank you .
Cameron Sinclair : The refugees of boom-and-bust
At TEDGlobal U , Cameron Sinclair shows the unreported cost of real estate megaprojects gone bust : thousands of migrant construction laborers left stranded and penniless . To his fellow architects , he says there is only one ethical response .
A few years ago , my eyes were opened to the dark side of the construction industry .
In 2006 , young Qatari students took me to go and see the migrant worker camps .
And since then I &apos;ve followed the unfolding issue of worker rights .
In the last six months , more than 300 skyscrapers in the UAE have been put on hold or canceled .
Behind the headlines that lay behind these buildings is the fate of the often-indentured construction worker .
1.1 million of them .
Mainly Indian , Pakistani , Sri Lankan and Nepalese , these laborers risk everything to make money for their families back home .
They pay a middle-man thousands of dollars to be there .
And when they arrive , they find themselves in labor camps with no water , no air conditioning , and their passports taken away .
While it &apos;s easy to point the finger at local officials and higher authorities , 99 percent of these people are hired by the private sector , and so therefore we &apos;re equally , if not more , accountable .
Groups like Buildsafe UAE have emerged , but the numbers are simply overwhelming .
In August 2008 , UAE public officials noted that 40 percent of the country &apos;s 1,098 labor camps had violated minimum health and fire safety regulations .
And last summer , more than 10,000 workers protested for the non-payment of wages , for the poor quality of food , and inadequate housing .
And then the financial collapse happened .
When the contractors have gone bust , as they &apos;ve been overleveraged like everyone else , the difference is everything goes missing , documentation , passports , and tickets home for these workers .
Currently , right now , thousands of workers are abandoned .
There is no way back home .
And there is no way , and no proof of arrival .
These are the boom-and-bust refugees .
The question is , as a building professional , as an architect , an engineer , as a developer , if you know this is going on , as we go to the sights every single week , are you complacent or complicit in the human rights violations ?
So let &apos;s forget your environmental footprint .
Let &apos;s think about your ethical footprint .
What good is it to build a zero-carbon , energy efficient complex , when the labor producing this architectural gem is unethical at best ?
Now , recently I &apos;ve been told I &apos;ve been taking the high road .
But , quite frankly , on this issue , there is no other road .
So let &apos;s not forget who is really paying the price of this financial collapse .
And that as we worry about our next job in the office , the next design that we can get , to keep our workers .
Let &apos;s not forget these men , who are truly dying to work .

Kevin Surace suggests we rethink basic construction materials -- such as the familiar wallboard -- to reduce the huge carbon footprint generated by the manufacturing and construction of our buildings . He introduces EcoRock , a clean , recyclable and energy-efficient drywall created by his team at Serious Materials .
What &apos;s happening to the climate ?
It is unbelievably bad .
This is , obviously , that famous view now of the Arctic , which is likely to be gone at this point in the next three or four or five years . Very , very , very scary .
So we all look at what we can do .
And when you look at the worldwide sources of CO2 , 52 percent are tied to buildings .
Only nine percent is passenger cars , interestingly enough .
So we ran off to a sushi bar .
And at that sushi bar we came up with a great idea .
And it was something called EcoRock .
And we said we could redesign the 115-year-old gypsum drywall process that generates 20 billion pounds of CO2 a year .
So it was a big idea . We wanted to reduce that by 80 percent , which is exactly what we &apos;ve done .
We started R &amp; amp ; D in 2006 .
Decided to use recycled content from cement and steel manufacturing .
There is the inside of our lab . We haven &apos;t shown this before .
But our people had to do some 5,000 different mixes to get this right , to hit our targets .
And they worked absolutely very , very , very hard .
So then we went forward and built our production line in China .
We don &apos;t build this production equipment any longer in the U.S. , unfortunately .
We did the line install over the summer .
We started right there , with absolutely nothing .
You &apos;re seeing for the first time , a brand new drywall production line , not made using gypsum at all .
That &apos;s the finished production line there .
We got our first panel out on December third .
That is the slurry being poured onto paper , basically . That &apos;s the line running .
The exciting thing is , look at the faces of the people .
These are people who worked this project for two to three years .
And they are so excited . That &apos;s the first board off the line .
Our Vice President of Operation kissing the board . Obviously very , very excited .
But this has a huge , huge impact on the environment .
We signed the first panel just a few weeks after that , had a great signing ceremony , leading to people hopefully using these products across the world .
And we &apos;ve got Cradle-to-Cradle Gold on this thing .
We happened to win , just recently , the Green Product of the Year for &quot; The Re-Invention of Drywall , &quot; from Popular Science .
Thank you . Thank you .
So here is what we learned : 8,000 gallons of gas equivalent to build one house .
You probably had no idea . It &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
We must change everything .
Look around the room : chairs , wood , everything around us has to change or we &apos;re not going to lick this problem .
Don &apos;t listen to the people who say you can &apos;t do this , because anyone can .
And these job losses , we can fix them with green-collar jobs .
We &apos;ve got four plants . We &apos;re building this stuff around the country .
We &apos;re going as fast as we can .
Two and a half million cars worth of gypsum , you know , CO2 generated . Right ?
So what will you do ? I &apos;ll tell you what I did and why I did it . And I know my time &apos;s up .
Those are my kids , Natalie and David .
When they have their kids , 2050 , they &apos;d better look back at Grandpa and say , &quot; Hey , you gave it a good shot . You did the best you could with the team that you had . &quot;
So my hope is that when you leave TED , you will look at reducing your carbon footprint in however you can do it .
And if you don &apos;t know how , please find me -- I will help you .
Last but not least , Bill Gates , I know you invented Windows .
Wait till you see , maybe next year , what kind of windows we &apos;ve invented .
Thank you so much .
Shigeru Ban : Emergency shelters made from paper
Long before sustainability was a buzzword , Pritzker Prize-winning architect Shigeru Ban had begun his experiments with ecologically sound building materials such as cardboard tubes . His remarkable structures are often intended as temporary housing for disaster-struck nations such as Haiti , Rwanda , Japan . Yet often the buildings remain a beloved part of the landscape long after they have served their intended purpose .
Hi . I am an architect .
I am the only architect in the world making buildings out of paper like this cardboard tube , and this exhibition is the first one I did using paper tubes .
1986 , much , much longer before people started talking about ecological issues and environmental issues , I just started testing the paper tube in order to use this as a building structure .
It &apos;s very complicated to test the new material for the building , but this is much stronger than I expected , and also it &apos;s very easy to waterproof , and also , because it &apos;s industrial material , it &apos;s also possible to fireproof .
Then I built the temporary structure , 1990 .
This is the first temporary building made out of paper .
There are 330 tubes , diameter 55 &#91; centimeters &#93; , there are only 12 tubes with a diameter of 120 centimeters , or four feet , wide .
As you see it in the photo , inside is the toilet .
In case you &apos;re finished with toilet paper , you can tear off the inside of the wall .
So it &apos;s very useful .
Year 2000 , there was a big expo in Germany .
I was asked to design the building , because the theme of the expo was environmental issues .
So I was chosen to build the pavilion out of paper tubes , recyclable paper .
My goal of the design is not when it &apos;s completed .
My goal was when the building was demolished , because each country makes a lot of pavilions but after half a year , we create a lot of industrial waste , so my building has to be reused or recycled .
After , the building was recycled .
So that was the goal of my design .
Then I was very lucky to win the competition to build the second Pompidou Center in France in the city of Metz .
Because I was so poor , I wanted to rent an office in Paris , but I couldn &apos;t afford it , so I decided to bring my students to Paris to build our office on top of the Pompidou Center in Paris by ourselves .
So we brought the paper tubes and the wooden joints to complete the 35-meter-long office .
We stayed there for six years without paying any rent .
Thank you . I had one big problem .
Because we were part of the exhibition , even if my friend wanted to see me , they had to buy a ticket to see me .
That was the problem .
Then I completed the Pompidou Center in Metz .
It &apos;s a very popular museum now , and I created a big monument for the government .
But then I was very disappointed at my profession as an architect , because we are not helping , we are not working for society , but we are working for privileged people , rich people , government , developers .
They have money and power .
Those are invisible .
So they hire us to visualize their power and money by making monumental architecture .
That is our profession , even historically it &apos;s the same , even now we are doing the same .
So I was very disappointed that we are not working for society , even though there are so many people who lost their houses by natural disasters .
But I must say they are no longer natural disasters .
For example , earthquakes never kill people , but collapse of the buildings kill people .
That &apos;s the responsibility of architects .
Then people need some temporary housing , but there are no architects working there because we are too busy working for privileged people .
So I thought , even as architects , we can be involved in the reconstruction of temporary housing .
We can make it better .
So that is why I started working in disaster areas .
1994 , there was a big disaster in Rwanda , Africa .
Two tribes , Hutu and Tutsi , fought each other .
Over two million people became refugees .
But I was so surprised to see the shelter , refugee camp organized by the U.N.
They &apos;re so poor , and they are freezing with blankets during the rainy season , In the shelters built by the U.N. , they were just providing a plastic sheet , and the refugees had to cut the trees , and just like this .
But over two million people cut trees .
It just became big , heavy deforestation and an environmental problem .
That is why they started providing aluminum pipes , aluminum barracks .
Very expensive , they throw them out for money , then cutting trees again .
So I proposed my idea to improve the situation using these recycled paper tubes because this is so cheap and also so strong , but my budget is only 50 U.S. dollars per unit .
We built 50 units to do that as a monitoring test for the durability and moisture and termites , so on .
And then , year afterward , 1995 , in Kobe , Japan , we had a big earthquake .
Nearly 7,000 people were killed , and the city like this Nagata district , all the city was burned in a fire after the earthquake .
And also I found out there &apos;s many Vietnamese refugees suffering and gathering at a Catholic church -- all the building was totally destroyed .
So I went there and also I proposed to the priests , &quot; Why don &apos;t we rebuild the church out of paper tubes ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Oh God , are you crazy ?
After a fire , what are you proposing ? &quot;
So he never trusted me , but I didn &apos;t give up .
I started commuting to Kobe , and I met the society of Vietnamese people .
They were living like this with very poor plastic sheets in the park .
So I proposed to rebuild . I raised -- did fundraising .
I made a paper tube shelter for them , and in order to make it easy to be built by students and also easy to demolish , I used beer crates as a foundation .
I asked the Kirin beer company to propose , because at that time , the Asahi beer company made their plastic beer crates red , which doesn &apos;t go with the color of the paper tubes .
The color coordination is very important .
And also I still remember , we were expecting to have a beer inside the plastic beer crate , but it came empty .
So I remember it was so disappointing .
So during the summer with my students , we built over 50 units of the shelters .
Finally the priest , finally he trusted me to rebuild .
He said , &quot; As long as you collect money by yourself , bring your students to build , you can do it . &quot;
So we spent five weeks rebuilding the church .
It was meant to stay there for three years , but actually it stayed there 10 years because people loved it .
Then , in Taiwan , they had a big earthquake , and we proposed to donate this church , so we dismantled them , we sent them over to be built by volunteer people .
It stayed there in Taiwan as a permanent church even now .
So this building became a permanent building .
Then I wonder , what is a permanent and what is a temporary building ?
Even a building made in paper can be permanent as long as people love it .
Even a concrete building can be very temporary if that is made to make money .
In 1999 , in Turkey , the big earthquake , I went there to use the local material to build a shelter .
2001 , in West India , I built also a shelter .
In 2004 , in Sri Lanka , after the Sumatra earthquake and tsunami , I rebuilt Islamic fishermen &apos;s villages .
And in 2008 , in Chengdu , Sichuan area in China , nearly 70,000 people were killed , and also especially many of the schools were destroyed because of the corruption between the authority and the contractor .
I was asked to rebuild the temporary church .
I brought my Japanese students to work with the Chinese students .
In one month , we completed nine classrooms , over 500 square meters .
It &apos;s still used , even after the current earthquake in China .
In 2009 , in Italy , L &apos;Aquila , also they had a big earthquake .
And this is a very interesting photo : former Prime Minister Berlusconi and Japanese former former former former Prime Minister Mr. Aso -- you know , because we have to change the prime minister ever year .
And they are very kind , affording my model .
I proposed a big rebuilding , a temporary music hall , because L &apos;Aquila is very famous for music and all the concert halls were destroyed , so musicians were moving out .
So I proposed to the mayor , I &apos;d like to rebuild the temporary auditorium .
He said , &quot; As long as you bring your money , you can do it . &quot;
And I was very lucky .
Mr. Berlusconi brought G8 summit , and our former prime minister came , so they helped us to collect money , and I got half a million euros from the Japanese government to rebuild this temporary auditorium .
Year 2010 in Haiti , there was a big earthquake , but it &apos;s impossible to fly over , so I went to Santo Domingo , next-door country , to drive six hours to get to Haiti with the local students in Santo Domingo to build 50 units of shelter out of local paper tubes .
This is what happened in Japan two years ago , in northern Japan .
After the earthquake and tsunami , people had to be evacuated in a big room like a gymnasium .
But look at this . There &apos;s no privacy .
People suffer mentally and physically .
So we went there to build partitions with all the student volunteers with paper tubes , just a very simple shelter out of the tube frame and the curtain .
However , some of the facility authority doesn &apos;t want us to do it , because , they said , simply , it &apos;s become more difficult to control them .
But it &apos;s really necessary to do it .
They don &apos;t have enough flat area to build standard government single-story housing like this one .
Look at this . Even civil government is doing such poor construction of the temporary housing , so dense and so messy because there is no storage , nothing , water is leaking , so I thought , we have to make multi-story building because there &apos;s no land and also it &apos;s not very comfortable .
So I proposed to the mayor while I was making partitions .
Finally I met a very nice mayor in Onagawa village in Miyagi .
He asked me to build three-story housing on baseball &#91; fields &#93; .
I used the shipping container and also the students helped us to make all the building furniture to make them comfortable , within the budget of the government but also the area of the house is exactly the same , but much more comfortable .
Many of the people want to stay here forever .
I was very happy to hear that .
Now I am working in New Zealand , Christchurch .
About 20 days before the Japanese earthquake happened , also they had a big earthquake , and many Japanese students were also killed , and the most important cathedral of the city , the symbol of Christchurch , was totally destroyed .
And I was asked to come to rebuild the temporary cathedral .
So this is under construction .
And I &apos;d like to keep building monuments that are beloved by people .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
Neil Burgess : How your brain tells you where you are
How do you remember where you parked your car ? How do you know if you &apos;re moving in the right direction ? Neuroscientist Neil Burgess studies the neural mechanisms that map the space around us , and how they link to memory and imagination .
When we park in a big parking lot , how do we remember where we parked our car ?
Here &apos;s the problem facing Homer .
And we &apos;re going to try to understand what &apos;s happening in his brain .
So we &apos;ll start with the hippocampus , shown in yellow , which is the organ of memory .
If you have damage there , like in Alzheimer &apos;s , you can &apos;t remember things including where you parked your car .
It &apos;s named after Latin for &quot; seahorse , &quot; which it resembles .
And like the rest of the brain , it &apos;s made of neurons .
So the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it .
And the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other .
The hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells , which are very densely interconnected .
And scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food .
So we &apos;re going to imagine we &apos;re recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here .
And when it fires a little spike of electricity , there &apos;s going to be a red dot and a click .
So what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment .
And it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike .
So we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal &apos;s location .
And if we record from lots of different neurons , we &apos;ll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment , like in this square box shown here .
So together they form a map for the rest of the brain , telling the brain continually , &quot; Where am I now within my environment ? &quot;
Place cells are also being recorded in humans .
So epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring .
And some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town .
And place cells in their hippocampi would fire , become active , start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town .
So how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment ?
Well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important .
So the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat &apos;s in .
And when you expand the box , the firing location expands .
The one below likes to fire whenever there &apos;s a wall close by to the south .
And if you put another wall inside the box , then the cell fires in both place wherever there &apos;s a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box .
So this predicts that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus .
And indeed , on the inputs to the hippocampus , cells are found which project into the hippocampus , which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it &apos;s exploring around .
So the cell on the left , you can see , it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east , whether it &apos;s the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table , which the animals are running around .
And the cell on the right there fires whenever there &apos;s a boundary to the south , whether it &apos;s the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart .
So that &apos;s one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it &apos;s exploring around .
We can also test where we think objects are , like this goal flag , in simple environments -- or indeed , where your car would be .
So we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember .
And then , if we put them back in the environment , generally they &apos;re quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was .
But on some trials , we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell .
In that case , we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment .
And what you see , for example , if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment , and then if you ask people where it was , but you &apos;ve made the environment bigger , where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out .
It &apos;s as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location , and then you can get back to that location by moving around so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern .
That guides you back to the location that you want to remember .
But we also know where we are through movement .
So if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements , which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back .
And place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell .
Now grid cells are found , again , on the inputs to the hippocampus , and they &apos;re a bit like place cells .
But now as the rat explores around , each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid .
And if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment , and each cell &apos;s grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells .
So the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one .
So together , it &apos;s as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you &apos;d find on a map , but using triangles .
And as it moves around , the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is , so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment .
Do people have grid cells ?
Well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry , the same orientations of grid , shown in orange here , it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we &apos;re running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between .
So we can put people in an MRI scanner and have them do a little video game like the one I showed you and look for this signal .
And indeed , you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex , which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats .
So back to Homer .
He &apos;s probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked .
And that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells .
He &apos;s also remembering the path he took out of the car park , which would be represented in the firing of grid cells .
Now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire .
And he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car .
And that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car &apos;s actually there .
Maybe it &apos;s been towed .
But he knows where it was , so he knows to go and get it .
So beyond spatial memory , if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain , we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks , like remembering the last time you went to a wedding , for example .
So it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene , at least , of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them .
So if this was happening , your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint .
And grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space .
Another kind of cell , head direction cells , which I didn &apos;t mention yet , they fire like a compass according to which way you &apos;re facing .
They could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery , so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding , for example .
So this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we &apos;re beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains .
Thank you very much .
Nigel Marsh : How to make work-life balance work
Work-life balance , says Nigel Marsh , is too important to be left in the hands of your employer . Marsh lays out an ideal day balanced between family time , personal time and productivity -- and offers some stirring encouragement to make it happen .
What I thought I would do is I would start with a simple request .
I &apos;d like all of you to pause for a moment , you wretched weaklings , and take stock of your miserable existence .
Now that was the advice that St. Benedict gave his rather startled followers in the fifth century .
It was the advice that I decided to follow myself when I turned 40 .
Up until that moment , I had been that classic corporate warrior -- I was eating too much , I was drinking too much , I was working too hard and I was neglecting the family .
And I decided that I would try and turn my life around .
In particular , I decided I would try to address the thorny issue of work-life balance .
So I stepped back from the workforce , and I spent a year at home with my wife and four young children .
But all I learned about work-life balance from that year was that I found it quite easy to balance work and life when I didn &apos;t have any work .
Not a very useful skill , especially when the money runs out .
So I went back to work , and I &apos;ve spent these seven years since struggling with , studying and writing about work-life balance .
And I have four observations I &apos;d like to share with you today .
The first is : if society &apos;s to make any progress on this issue , we need an honest debate .
But the trouble is so many people talk so much rubbish about work-life balance .
All the discussions about flexi-time or dress-down Fridays or paternity leave only serve to mask the core issue , which is that certain job and career choices are fundamentally incompatible with being meaningfully engaged on a day-to-day basis with a young family .
Now the first step in solving any problem is acknowledging the reality of the situation you &apos;re in .
And the reality of the society that we &apos;re in is there are thousands and thousands of people out there leading lives of quiet , screaming desperation , where they work long , hard hours at jobs they hate to enable them to buy things they don &apos;t need to impress people they don &apos;t like .
It &apos;s my contention that going to work on Friday in jeans and &#91; a &#93; T-shirt isn &apos;t really getting to the nub of the issue .
The second observation I &apos;d like to make is we need to face the truth that governments and corporations aren &apos;t going to solve this issue for us .
We should stop looking outside .
It &apos;s up to us as individuals to take control and responsibility for the type of lives that we want to lead .
If you don &apos;t design your life , someone else will design it for you , and you may just not like their idea of balance .
It &apos;s particularly important -- this isn &apos;t on the World Wide Web , is it ? I &apos;m about to get fired -- it &apos;s particularly important that you never put the quality of your life in the hands of a commercial corporation .
Now I &apos;m not talking here just about the bad companies -- the &quot; abattoirs of the human soul , &quot; as I call them .
I &apos;m talking about all companies .
Because commercial companies are inherently designed to get as much out of you &#91; as &#93; they can get away with .
It &apos;s in their nature ; it &apos;s in their DNA ; it &apos;s what they do -- even the good , well-intentioned companies .
On the one hand , putting childcare facilities in the workplace is wonderful and enlightened .
On the other hand , it &apos;s a nightmare -- it just means you spend more time at the bloody office .
We have to be responsible for setting and enforcing the boundaries that we want in our life .
The third observation is we have to be careful with the time frame that we choose upon which to judge our balance .
Before I went back to work after my year at home , I sat down and I wrote out a detailed , step-by-step description of the ideal balanced day that I aspired to .
And it went like this : wake up well rested after a good night &apos;s sleep .
Have sex .
Walk the dog .
Have breakfast with my wife and children .
Have sex again .
Drive the kids to school on the way to the office .
Do three hours &apos; work .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
Do another three hours &apos; work .
Meet some mates in the pub for an early evening drink .
Drive home for dinner with my wife and kids .
Meditate for half an hour .
Have sex .
Walk the dog . Have sex again .
Go to bed .
How often do you think I have that day ?
We need to be realistic .
You can &apos;t do it all in one day .
We need to elongate the time frame upon which we judge the balance in our life , but we need to elongate it without falling into the trap of the &quot; I &apos;ll have a life when I retire , when my kids have left home , when my wife has divorced me , my health is failing , I &apos;ve got no mates or interests left . &quot;
A day is too short ; &quot; after I retire &quot; is too long .
There &apos;s got to be a middle way .
A fourth observation : We need to approach balance in a balanced way .
A friend came to see me last year -- and she doesn &apos;t mind me telling this story -- a friend came to see me last year and said , &quot; Nigel , I &apos;ve read your book .
And I realize that my life is completely out of balance .
It &apos;s totally dominated by work .
I work 10 hours a day ; I commute two hours a day .
All of my relationships have failed .
There &apos;s nothing in my life apart from my work .
So I &apos;ve decided to get a grip and sort it out .
So I joined a gym . &quot;
Now I don &apos;t mean to mock , but being a fit 10-hour-a-day office rat isn &apos;t more balanced ; it &apos;s more fit .
Lovely though physical exercise may be , there are other parts to life -- there &apos;s the intellectual side ; there &apos;s the emotional side ; there &apos;s the spiritual side .
And to be balanced , I believe we have to attend to all of those areas -- not just do 50 stomach crunches .
Now that can be daunting .
Because people say , &quot; Bloody hell mate , I haven &apos;t got time to get fit .
You want me to go to church and call my mother . &quot;
And I understand .
I truly understand how that can be daunting .
But an incident that happened a couple of years ago gave me a new perspective .
My wife , who is somewhere in the audience today , called me up at the office and said , &quot; Nigel , you need to pick our youngest son &quot; -- Harry -- &quot; up from school . &quot;
Because she had to be somewhere else with the other three children for that evening .
So I left work an hour early that afternoon and picked Harry up at the school gates .
We walked down to the local park , messed around on the swings , played some silly games .
I then walked him up the hill to the local cafe , and we shared a pizza for two , then walked down the hill to our home , and I gave him his bath and put him in his Batman pajamas .
I then read him a chapter of Roald Dahl &apos;s &quot; James and the Giant Peach . &quot;
I then put him to bed , tucked him in , gave him a kiss on his forehead and said , &quot; Goodnight , mate , &quot; and walked out of his bedroom .
As I was walking out of his bedroom , he said , &quot; Dad ? &quot; I went , &quot; Yes , mate ? &quot;
He went , &quot; Dad , this has been the best day of my life , ever . &quot;
I hadn &apos;t done anything , hadn &apos;t taken him to Disney World or bought him a Playstation .
Now my point is the small things matter .
Being more balanced doesn &apos;t mean dramatic upheaval in your life .
With the smallest investment in the right places , you can radically transform the quality of your relationships and the quality of your life .
Moreover , I think , it can transform society .
Because if enough people do it , we can change society &apos;s definition of success away from the moronically simplistic notion that the person with the most money when he dies wins , to a more thoughtful and balanced definition of what a life well lived looks like .
And that , I think , is an idea worth spreading .
Sam Harris : Science can answer moral questions
Questions of good and evil , right and wrong are commonly thought unanswerable by science . But Sam Harris argues that science can -- and should -- be an authority on moral issues , shaping human values and setting out what constitutes a good life .
I &apos;m going to speak today about the relationship between science and human values .
Now , it &apos;s generally understood that questions of morality -- questions of good and evil and right and wrong -- are questions about which science officially has no opinion .
It &apos;s thought that science can help us get what we value , but it can never tell us what we ought to value .
And , consequently , most people -- I think most people probably here -- think that science will never answer the most important questions in human life : questions like , &quot; What is worth living for ? &quot;
&quot; What is worth dying for ? &quot;
&quot; What constitutes a good life ? &quot;
So , I &apos;m going to argue that this is an illusion -- that the separation between science and human values is an illusion -- and actually quite a dangerous one at this point in human history .
Now , it &apos;s often said that science cannot give us a foundation for morality and human values , because science deals with facts , and facts and values seem to belong to different spheres .
It &apos;s often thought that there &apos;s no description of the way the world is that can tell us how the world ought to be .
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
Values are a certain kind of fact .
They are facts about the well-being of conscious creatures .
Why is it that we don &apos;t have ethical obligations toward rocks ?
Why don &apos;t we feel compassion for rocks ?
It &apos;s because we don &apos;t think rocks can suffer . And if we &apos;re more concerned about our fellow primates than we are about insects , as indeed we are , it &apos;s because we think they &apos;re exposed to a greater range of potential happiness and suffering .
Now , the crucial thing to notice here is that this is a factual claim : This is something that we could be right or wrong about . And if we have misconstrued the relationship between biological complexity and the possibilities of experience well then we could be wrong about the inner lives of insects .
And there &apos;s no notion , no version of human morality and human values that I &apos;ve ever come across that is not at some point reducible to a concern about conscious experience and its possible changes .
Even if you get your values from religion , even if you think that good and evil ultimately relate to conditions after death -- either to an eternity of happiness with God or an eternity of suffering in hell -- you are still concerned about consciousness and its changes .
And to say that such changes can persist after death is itself a factual claim , which , of course , may or may not be true .
Now , to speak about the conditions of well-being in this life , for human beings , we know that there is a continuum of such facts .
We know that it &apos;s possible to live in a failed state , where everything that can go wrong does go wrong -- where mothers cannot feed their children , where strangers cannot find the basis for peaceful collaboration , where people are murdered indiscriminately .
And we know that it &apos;s possible to move along this continuum towards something quite a bit more idyllic , to a place where a conference like this is even conceivable .
And we know -- we know -- that there are right and wrong answers to how to move in this space .
Would adding cholera to the water be a good idea ?
Probably not .
Would it be a good idea for everyone to believe in the evil eye , so that when bad things happened to them they immediately blame their neighbors ? Probably not .
There are truths to be known about how human communities flourish , whether or not we understand these truths .
And morality relates to these truths .
So , in talking about values we are talking about facts .
Now , of course our situation in the world can be understood at many levels -- from the level of the genome on up to the level of economic systems and political arrangements .
But if we &apos;re going to talk about human well-being we are , of necessity , talking about the human brain .
Because we know that our experience of the world and of ourselves within it is realized in the brain -- whatever happens after death .
Even if the suicide bomber does get 72 virgins in the afterlife , in this life , his personality -- his rather unfortunate personality -- is the product of his brain .
So the contributions of culture -- if culture changes us , as indeed it does , it changes us by changing our brains .
And so therefore whatever cultural variation there is in how human beings flourish can , at least in principle , be understood in the context of a maturing science of the mind -- neuroscience , psychology , etc .
So , what I &apos;m arguing is that value &apos;s reduced to facts -- to facts about the conscious experience of conscious beings .
And we can therefore visualize a space of possible changes in the experience of these beings .
And I think of this as kind of a moral landscape , with peaks and valleys that correspond to differences in the well-being of conscious creatures , both personal and collective .
And one thing to notice is that perhaps there are states of human well-being that we rarely access , that few people access .
And these await our discovery .
Perhaps some of these states can be appropriately called mystical or spiritual .
Perhaps there are other states that we can &apos;t access because of how our minds are structured but other minds possibly could access them .
Now , let me be clear about what I &apos;m not saying . I &apos;m not saying that science is guaranteed to map this space , or that we will have scientific answers to every conceivable moral question .
I don &apos;t think , for instance , that you will one day consult a supercomputer to learn whether you should have a second child , or whether we should bomb Iran &apos;s nuclear facilities , or whether you can deduct the full cost of TED as a business expense .
But if questions affect human well-being then they do have answers , whether or not we can find them .
And just admitting this -- just admitting that there are right and wrong answers to the question of how humans flourish -- will change the way we talk about morality , and will change our expectations of human cooperation in the future .
For instance , there are 21 states in our country where corporal punishment in the classroom is legal , where it is legal for a teacher to beat a child with a wooden board , hard , and raising large bruises and blisters and even breaking the skin .
And hundreds of thousands of children , incidentally , are subjected to this every year .
The locations of these enlightened districts , I think , will fail to surprise you .
We &apos;re not talking about Connecticut .
And the rationale for this behavior is explicitly religious .
The creator of the universe himself has told us not to spare the rod , lest we spoil the child -- this is in Proverbs 13 and 20 , and I believe , 23 .
But we can ask the obvious question : Is it a good idea , generally speaking , to subject children to pain and violence and public humiliation as a way of encouraging healthy emotional development and good behavior ?
Is there any doubt that this question has an answer , and that it matters ?
Now , many of you might worry that the notion of well-being is truly undefined , and seemingly perpetually open to be re-construed .
And so , how therefore can there be an objective notion of well-being ?
Well , consider by analogy , the concept of physical health .
The concept of physical health is undefined .
As we just heard from Michael Specter , it has changed over the years .
When this statue was carved the average life expectancy was probably 30 .
It &apos;s now around 80 in the developed world .
There may come a time when we meddle with our genomes in such a way that not being able to run a marathon at age 200 will be considered a profound disability .
People will send you donations when you &apos;re in that condition .
Notice that the fact that the concept of health is open , genuinely open for revision , does not make it vacuous .
The distinction between a healthy person and a dead one is about as clear and consequential as any we make in science .
Another thing to notice is there may be many peaks on the moral landscape : There may be equivalent ways to thrive ; there may be equivalent ways to organize a human society so as to maximize human flourishing .
Now , why wouldn &apos;t this undermine an objective morality ?
Well think of how we talk about food : I would never be tempted to argue to you that there must be one right food to eat .
There is clearly a range of materials that constitute healthy food .
But there &apos;s nevertheless a clear distinction between food and poison .
The fact that there are many right answers to the question , &quot; What is food ? &quot;
does not tempt us to say that there are no truths to be known about human nutrition .
Many people worry that a universal morality would require moral precepts that admit of no exceptions .
So , for instance , if it &apos;s really wrong to lie , it must always be wrong to lie , and if you can find an exception , well then there &apos;s no such thing as moral truth .
Why would we think this ?
Consider , by analogy , the game of chess .
Now , if you &apos;re going to play good chess , a principle like , &quot; Don &apos;t lose your Queen , &quot; is very good to follow .
But it clearly admits some exceptions .
There are moments when losing your Queen is a brilliant thing to do .
There are moments when it is the only good thing you can do .
And yet , chess is a domain of perfect objectivity .
The fact that there are exceptions here does not change that at all .
Now , this brings us to the sorts of moves that people are apt to make in the moral sphere .
Consider the great problem of women &apos;s bodies : What to do about them ?
Well this is one thing you can do about them : You can cover them up .
Now , it is the position , generally speaking , of our intellectual community that while we may not like this , we might think of this as &quot; wrong &quot; in Boston or Palo Alto , who are we to say that the proud denizens of an ancient culture are wrong to force their wives and daughters to live in cloth bags ?
And who are we to say , even , that they &apos;re wrong to beat them with lengths of steel cable , or throw battery acid in their faces if they decline the privilege of being smothered in this way ?
Well , who are we not to say this ?
Who are we to pretend that we know so little about human well-being that we have to be non-judgmental about a practice like this ?
I &apos;m not talking about voluntary wearing of a veil -- women should be able to wear whatever they want , as far as I &apos;m concerned .
But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
Just let that fact detonate in your brain for a minute : Your daughter gets raped , and what you want to do is kill her .
What are the chances that represents a peak of human flourishing ?
Now , to say this is not to say that we have got the perfect solution in our own society .
For instance , this is what it &apos;s like to go to a newsstand almost anywhere in the civilized world .
Now , granted , for many men it may require a degree in philosophy to see something wrong with these images .
But if we are in a reflective mood , we can ask , &quot; Is this the perfect expression of psychological balance with respect to variables like youth and beauty and women &apos;s bodies ? &quot;
I mean , is this the optimal environment in which to raise our children ?
Probably not . OK , so perhaps there &apos;s some place on the spectrum between these two extremes that represents a place of better balance .
Perhaps there are many such places -- again , given other changes in human culture there may be many peaks on the moral landscape .
But the thing to notice is that there will be many more ways not to be on a peak .
Now the irony , from my perspective , is that the only people who seem to generally agree with me and who think that there are right and wrong answers to moral questions are religious demagogues of one form or another .
And of course they think they have right answers to moral questions because they got these answers from a voice in a whirlwind , not because they made an intelligent analysis of the causes and condition of human and animal well-being .
In fact , the endurance of religion as a lens through which most people view moral questions has separated most moral talk from real questions of human and animal suffering .
This is why we spend our time talking about things like gay marriage and not about genocide or nuclear proliferation or poverty or any other hugely consequential issue .
But the demagogues are right about one thing : We need a universal conception of human values .
Now , what stands in the way of this ?
Well , one thing to notice is that we do something different when talking about morality -- especially secular , academic , scientist types .
When talking about morality we value differences of opinion in a way that we don &apos;t in any other area of our lives .
So , for instance the Dalai Lama gets up every morning meditating on compassion , and he thinks that helping other human beings is an integral component of human happiness .
On the other hand , we have someone like Ted Bundy ; Ted Bundy was very fond of abducting and raping and torturing and killing young women .
So , we appear to have a genuine difference of opinion about how to profitably use one &apos;s time .
Most Western intellectuals look at this situation and say , &quot; Well , there &apos;s nothing for the Dalai Lama or for Ted Bundy to be really wrong about that admits of a real argument that potentially falls within the purview of science .
He likes chocolate , he likes vanilla .
There &apos;s nothing that one should be able to say to the other that should persuade the other . &quot;
Notice that we don &apos;t do this in science .
On the left you have Edward Witten .
He &apos;s a string theorist .
If you ask the smartest physicists around who is the smartest physicist around , in my experience half of them will say Ed Witten .
The other half will tell you they don &apos;t like the question .
So , what would happen if I showed up at a physics conference and said , &quot; String theory is bogus .
It doesn &apos;t resonate with me . It &apos;s not how I chose to view the universe at a small scale .
I &apos;m not a fan . &quot;
Well , nothing would happen because I &apos;m not a physicist ; I don &apos;t understand string theory .
I &apos;m the Ted Bundy of string theory .
I wouldn &apos;t want to belong to any string theory club that would have me as a member .
But this is just the point .
Whenever we are talking about facts certain opinions must be excluded .
That is what it is to have a domain of expertise .
That is what it is for knowledge to count .
How have we convinced ourselves that in the moral sphere there is no such thing as moral expertise , or moral talent , or moral genius even ?
How have we convinced ourselves that every opinion has to count ?
How have we convinced ourselves that every culture has a point of view on these subjects worth considering ?
Does the Taliban have a point of view on physics that is worth considering ? No .
How is their ignorance any less obvious on the subject of human well-being ?
So , this , I think , is what the world needs now .
It needs people like ourselves to admit that there are right and wrong answers to questions of human flourishing , and morality relates to that domain of facts .
It is possible for individuals , and even for whole cultures , to care about the wrong things , which is to say that it &apos;s possible for them to have beliefs and desires that reliably lead to needless human suffering .
Just admitting this will transform our discourse about morality .
We live in a world in which the boundaries between nations mean less and less , and they will one day mean nothing .
We live in a world filled with destructive technology , and this technology cannot be uninvented ; it will always be easier to break things than to fix them .
It seems to me , therefore , patently obvious that we can no more respect and tolerate vast differences in notions of human well-being than we can respect or tolerate vast differences in the notions about how disease spreads , or in the safety standards of buildings and airplanes .
We simply must converge on the answers we give to the most important questions in human life .
And to do that , we have to admit that these questions have answers .
Thank you very much .
So , some combustible material there .
Whether in this audience or people elsewhere in the world , hearing some of this , may well be doing the screaming-with-rage thing , after as well , some of them .
Language seems to be really important here .
When you &apos;re talking about the veil , you &apos;re talking about women dressed in cloth bags .
I &apos;ve lived in the Muslim world , spoken with a lot of Muslim women .
And some of them would say something else . They would say , &quot; No , you know , this is a celebration of female specialness , it helps build that and it &apos;s a result of the fact that &quot; -- and this is arguably a sophisticated psychological view -- &quot; that male lust is not to be trusted . &quot;
I mean , can you engage in a conversation with that kind of woman without seeming kind of cultural imperialist ?
Sam Harris : Yeah , well I think I tried to broach this in a sentence , watching the clock ticking , but the question is : What is voluntary in a context where men have certain expectations , and you &apos;re guaranteed to be treated in a certain way if you don &apos;t veil yourself ?
And so , if anyone in this room wanted to wear a veil , or a very funny hat , or tattoo their face -- I think we should be free to voluntarily do whatever we want , but we have to be honest about the constraints that these women are placed under .
And so I think we shouldn &apos;t be so eager to always take their word for it , especially when it &apos;s 120 degrees out and you &apos;re wearing a full burqa .
A lot of people want to believe in this concept of moral progress .
But can you reconcile that ?
I think I understood you to say that you could reconcile that with a world that doesn &apos;t become one dimensional , where we all have to think the same .
Paint your picture of what rolling the clock 50 years forward , 100 years forward , how you would like to think of the world , balancing moral progress with richness .
SH : Well , I think once you admit that we are on the path toward understanding our minds at the level of the brain in some important detail , then you have to admit that we are going to understand all of the positive and negative qualities of ourselves in much greater detail .
So , we &apos;re going to understand positive social emotion like empathy and compassion , and we &apos;re going to understand the factors that encourage it -- whether they &apos;re genetic , whether they &apos;re how people talk to one another , whether they &apos;re economic systems , and insofar as we begin to shine light on that we are inevitably going to converge on that fact space .
So , everything is not going to be up for grabs .
It &apos;s not going to be like veiling my daughter from birth is just as good as teaching her to be confident and well-educated in the context of men who do desire women .
I mean I don &apos;t think we need an NSF grant to know that compulsory veiling is a bad idea -- but at a certain point we &apos;re going to be able to scan the brains of everyone involved and actually interrogate them .
Do people love their daughters just as much in these systems ?
And I think there are clearly right answers to that .
And if the results come out that actually they do , are you prepared to shift your instinctive current judgment on some of these issues ?
SH : Well yeah , modulo one obvious fact , that you can love someone in the context of a truly delusional belief system .
So , you can say like , &quot; Because I knew my gay son was going to go to hell if he found a boyfriend , I chopped his head off . And that was the most compassionate thing I could do . &quot;
If you get all those parts aligned , yes I think you could probably be feeling the emotion of love .
But again , then we have to talk about well-being in a larger context .
It &apos;s all of us in this together , not one man feeling ecstasy and then blowing himself up on a bus .
Sam , this is a conversation I would actually love to continue for hours .
We don &apos;t have that , but maybe another time . Thank you for coming to TED .
SH : Really an honor . Thank you .
Kathryn Schulz : On being wrong
Most of us will do anything to avoid being wrong . But what if we &apos;re wrong about that ? &quot; Wrongologist &quot; Kathryn Schulz makes a compelling case for not just admitting but embracing our fallibility .
So it &apos;s 1995 , I &apos;m in college , and a friend and I go on a road trip from Providence , Rhode Island to Portland , Oregon .
And you know , we &apos;re young and unemployed , so we do the whole thing on back roads through state parks and national forests -- basically the longest route we can possibly take .
And somewhere in the middle of South Dakota , I turn to my friend and I ask her a question that &apos;s been bothering me for 2,000 miles .
&quot; What &apos;s up with the Chinese character I keep seeing by the side of the road ? &quot;
My friend looks at me totally blankly .
There &apos;s actually a gentleman in the front row who &apos;s doing a perfect imitation of her look .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; You know , all the signs we keep seeing with the Chinese character on them . &quot;
She just stares at me for a few moments , and then she cracks up , because she figures out what I &apos;m talking about .
And what I &apos;m talking about is this .
Right , the famous Chinese character for picnic area .
I &apos;ve spent the last five years of my life thinking about situations exactly like this -- why we sometimes misunderstand the signs around us , and how we behave when that happens , and what all of this can tell us about human nature .
In other words , as you heard Chris say , I &apos;ve spent the last five years thinking about being wrong .
This might strike you as a strange career move , but it actually has one great advantage : no job competition .
In fact , most of us do everything we can to avoid thinking about being wrong , or at least to avoid thinking about the possibility that we ourselves are wrong .
We get it in the abstract .
We all know everybody in this room makes mistakes .
The human species , in general , is fallible -- okay fine .
But when it comes down to me , right now , to all the beliefs I hold , here in the present tense , suddenly all of this abstract appreciation of fallibility goes out the window -- and I can &apos;t actually think of anything I &apos;m wrong about .
And the thing is , the present tense is where we live .
We go to meetings in the present tense ; we go on family vacations in the present tense ; we go to the polls and vote in the present tense .
So effectively , we all kind of wind up traveling through life , trapped in this little bubble of feeling very right about everything .
I think this is a problem .
I think it &apos;s a problem for each of us as individuals , in our personal and professional lives , and I think it &apos;s a problem for all of us collectively as a culture .
So what I want to do today is , first of all , talk about why we get stuck inside this feeling of being right .
And second , why it &apos;s such a problem .
And finally , I want to convince you that it is possible to step outside of that feeling and that if you can do so , it is the single greatest moral , intellectual and creative leap you can make .
So why do we get stuck in this feeling of being right ?
One reason , actually , has to do with a feeling of being wrong .
So let me ask you guys something -- or actually , let me ask you guys something , because you &apos;re right here : How does it feel -- emotionally -- how does it feel to be wrong ?
Dreadful . Thumbs down .
Embarrassing . Okay , wonderful , great .
Dreadful , thumbs down , embarrassing -- thank you , these are great answers , but they &apos;re answers to a different question .
You guys are answering the question : How does it feel to realize you &apos;re wrong ?
Realizing you &apos;re wrong can feel like all of that and a lot of other things , right ?
I mean it can be devastating , it can be revelatory , it can actually be quite funny , like my stupid Chinese character mistake .
But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
I &apos;ll give you an analogy .
Do you remember that Loony Tunes cartoon where there &apos;s this pathetic coyote who &apos;s always chasing and never catching a roadrunner ?
In pretty much every episode of this cartoon , there &apos;s a moment where the coyote is chasing the roadrunner and the roadrunner runs off a cliff , which is fine -- he &apos;s a bird , he can fly .
But the thing is , the coyote runs off the cliff right after him .
And what &apos;s funny -- at least if you &apos;re six years old -- is that the coyote &apos;s totally fine too .
He just keeps running -- right up until the moment that he looks down and realizes that he &apos;s in mid-air .
That &apos;s when he falls .
When we &apos;re wrong about something -- not when we realize it , but before that -- we &apos;re like that coyote after he &apos;s gone off the cliff and before he looks down .
You know , we &apos;re already wrong , we &apos;re already in trouble , but we feel like we &apos;re on solid ground .
So I should actually correct something I said a moment ago .
It does feel like something to be wrong ; it feels like being right .
So this is one reason , a structural reason , why we get stuck inside this feeling of rightness .
I call this error blindness .
Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .
But there &apos;s a second reason that we get stuck inside this feeling as well -- and this one is cultural .
Think back for a moment to elementary school .
You &apos;re sitting there in class , and your teacher is handing back quiz papers , and one of them looks like this .
This is not mine , by the way .
So there you are in grade school , and you know exactly what to think about the kid who got this paper .
It &apos;s the dumb kid , the troublemaker , the one who never does his homework .
So by the time you are nine years old , you &apos;ve already learned , first of all , that people who get stuff wrong are lazy , irresponsible dimwits -- and second of all , that the way to succeed in life is to never make any mistakes .
We learn these really bad lessons really well .
And a lot of us -- and I suspect , especially a lot of us in this room -- deal with them by just becoming perfect little A students , perfectionists , over-achievers .
Right , Mr. CFO , astrophysicist , ultra-marathoner ?
You &apos;re all CFO , astrophysicists , ultra-marathoners , it turns out .
Okay , so fine .
Except that then we freak out at the possibility that we &apos;ve gotten something wrong .
Because according to this , getting something wrong means there &apos;s something wrong with us .
So we just insist that we &apos;re right , because it makes us feel smart and responsible and virtuous and safe .
So let me tell you a story .
A couple of years ago , a woman comes into Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for a surgery .
Beth Israel &apos;s in Boston .
It &apos;s the teaching hospital for Harvard -- one of the best hospitals in the country .
So this woman comes in and she &apos;s taken into the operating room .
She &apos;s anesthetized , the surgeon does his thing -- stitches her back up , sends her out to the recovery room .
Everything seems to have gone fine .
And she wakes up , and she looks down at herself , and she says , &quot; Why is the wrong side of my body in bandages ? &quot;
Well the wrong side of her body is in bandages because the surgeon has performed a major operation on her left leg instead of her right one .
When the vice president for health care quality at Beth Israel spoke about this incident , he said something very interesting .
He said , &quot; For whatever reason , the surgeon simply felt that he was on the correct side of the patient . &quot;
The point of this story is that trusting too much in the feeling of being on the correct side of anything can be very dangerous .
This internal sense of rightness that we all experience so often is not a reliable guide to what is actually going on in the external world .
And when we act like it is , and we stop entertaining the possibility that we could be wrong , well that &apos;s when we end up doing things like dumping 200 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , or torpedoing the global economy .
So this is a huge practical problem .
But it &apos;s also a huge social problem .
Think for a moment about what it means to feel right .
It means that you think that your beliefs just perfectly reflect reality .
And when you feel that way , you &apos;ve got a problem to solve , which is , how are you going to explain all of those people who disagree with you ?
It turns out , most of us explain those people the same way , by resorting to a series of unfortunate assumptions .
The first thing we usually do when someone disagrees with us is we just assume they &apos;re ignorant .
They don &apos;t have access to the same information that we do , and when we generously share that information with them , they &apos;re going to see the light and come on over to our team .
When that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out those people have all the same facts that we do and they still disagree with us , then we move on to a second assumption , which is that they &apos;re idiots .
They have all the right pieces of the puzzle , and they are too moronic to put them together correctly .
And when that doesn &apos;t work , when it turns out that people who disagree with us have all the same facts we do and are actually pretty smart , then we move on to a third assumption : they know the truth , and they are deliberately distorting it for their own malevolent purposes .
So this is a catastrophe .
This attachment to our own rightness keeps us from preventing mistakes when we absolutely need to and causes us to treat each other terribly .
But to me , what &apos;s most baffling and most tragic about this is that it misses the whole point of being human .
It &apos;s like we want to imagine that our minds are just these perfectly translucent windows and we just gaze out of them and describe the world as it unfolds .
And we want everybody else to gaze out of the same window and see the exact same thing .
That is not true , and if it were , life would be incredibly boring .
The miracle of your mind isn &apos;t that you can see the world as it is .
It &apos;s that you can see the world as it isn &apos;t .
We can remember the past , and we can think about the future , and we can imagine what it &apos;s like to be some other person in some other place .
And we all do this a little differently , which is why we can all look up at the same night sky and see this and also this and also this .
And yeah , it is also why we get things wrong .
1,200 years before Descartes said his famous thing about &quot; I think therefore I am , &quot; this guy , St. Augustine , sat down and wrote &quot; Fallor ergo sum &quot; -- &quot; I err therefore I am . &quot;
Augustine understood that our capacity to screw up , it &apos;s not some kind of embarrassing defect in the human system , something we can eradicate or overcome .
It &apos;s totally fundamental to who we are .
Because , unlike God , we don &apos;t really know what &apos;s going on out there .
And unlike all of the other animals , we are obsessed with trying to figure it out .
To me , this obsession is the source and root of all of our productivity and creativity .
Last year , for various reasons , I found myself listening to a lot of episodes of the Public Radio show This American Life .
And so I &apos;m listening and I &apos;m listening , and at some point , I start feeling like all the stories are about being wrong .
And my first thought was , &quot; I &apos;ve lost it .
I &apos;ve become the crazy wrongness lady .
I just imagined it everywhere , &quot; which has happened .
But a couple of months later , I actually had a chance to interview Ira Glass , who &apos;s the host of the show .
And I mentioned this to him , and he was like , &quot; No actually , that &apos;s true .
In fact , &quot; he says , &quot; as a staff , we joke that every single episode of our show has the same crypto-theme .
And the crypto-theme is : &apos; I thought this one thing was going to happen and something else happened instead . &apos; And the thing is , &quot; says Ira Glass , &quot; we need this .
We need these moments of surprise and reversal and wrongness to make these stories work . &quot;
And for the rest of us , audience members , as listeners , as readers , we eat this stuff up .
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
When it comes to our stories , we love being wrong .
But , you know , our stories are like this because our lives are like this .
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
George Bush thought he was going to invade Iraq , find a bunch of weapons of mass destruction , liberate the people and bring democracy to the Middle East .
And something else happened instead .
And Hosni Mubarak thought he was going to be the dictator of Egypt for the rest of his life , until he got too old or too sick and could pass the reigns of power onto his son .
And something else happened instead .
And maybe you thought you were going to grow up and marry your high school sweetheart and move back to your hometown and raise a bunch of kids together .
And something else happened instead .
And I have to tell you that I thought I was writing an incredibly nerdy book about a subject everybody hates for an audience that would never materialize .
And something else happened instead .
I mean , this is life .
For good and for ill , we generate these incredible stories about the world around us , and then the world turns around and astonishes us .
No offense , but this entire conference is an unbelievable monument to our capacity to get stuff wrong .
We just spent an entire week talking about innovations and advancements and improvements , but you know why we need all of those innovations and advancements and improvements ?
Because half the stuff that &apos;s the most mind-boggling and world-altering -- TED 1998 -- eh .
Didn &apos;t really work out that way , did it ?
Where &apos;s my jet pack , Chris ?
So here we are again .
And that &apos;s how it goes .
We come up with another idea .
We tell another story .
We hold another conference .
The theme of this one , as you guys have now heard seven million times , is the rediscovery of wonder .
And to me , if you really want to rediscover wonder , you need to step outside of that tiny , terrified space of rightness and look around at each other and look out at the vastness and complexity and mystery of the universe and be able to say , &quot; Wow , I don &apos;t know .
Maybe I &apos;m wrong . &quot;
Thank you .
Thank you guys .
Neil MacGregor : 2600 years of history in one object
A clay cylinder covered in Akkadian cuneiform script , damaged and broken , the Cyrus Cylinder is a powerful symbol of religious tolerance and multi-culturalism . In this enthralling talk Neil MacGregor , Director of the British Museum , traces 2600 years of Middle Eastern history through this single object .
The things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us .
We perish , they survive ; we have one life , they have many lives , and in each life they can mean different things .
Which means that , while we all have one biography , they have many .
I want this morning to talk about the story , the biography -- or rather the biographies -- of one particular object , one remarkable thing .
It doesn &apos;t , I agree , look very much .
It &apos;s about the size of a rugby ball .
It &apos;s made of clay , and it &apos;s been fashioned into a cylinder shape , covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun .
And as you can see , it &apos;s been knocked about a bit , which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879 .
But today , this thing is , I believe , a major player in the politics of the Middle East .
And it &apos;s an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet .
The story begins in the Iran-Iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of Iraq by foreign forces , the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change .
And I want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with , Belshazzar &apos;s feast -- because we &apos;re talking about the Iran-Iraq war of 539 BC .
And the parallels between the events of 539 BC and 2003 and in between are startling .
What you &apos;re looking at is Rembrandt &apos;s painting , now in the National Gallery in London , illustrating the text from the prophet Daniel in the Hebrew scriptures .
And you all know roughly the story .
Belshazzar , the son of Nebuchadnezzar , Nebuchadnezzar who &apos;d conquered Israel , sacked Jerusalem and captured the people and taken the Jews back to Babylon .
Not only the Jews , he &apos;d taken the temple vessels .
He &apos;d ransacked , desecrated the temple .
And the great gold vessels of the temple in Jerusalem had been taken to Babylon .
Belshazzar , his son , decides to have a feast .
And in order to make it even more exciting , he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun , and he brings out the temple vessels .
He &apos;s already at war with the Iranians , with the king of Persia .
And that night , Daniel tells us , at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall , &quot; You are weighed in the balance and found wanting , and your kingdom is handed over to the Medes and the Persians . &quot;
And that very night Cyrus , king of the Persians , entered Babylon and the whole regime of Belshazzar fell .
It is , of course , a great moment in the history of the Jewish people .
It &apos;s a great story . It &apos;s story we all know .
&quot; The writing on the wall &quot; is part of our everyday language .
What happened next was remarkable , and it &apos;s where our cylinder enters the story .
Cyrus , king of the Persians , has entered Babylon without a fight -- the great empire of Babylon , which ran from central southern Iraq to the Mediterranean , falls to Cyrus .
And Cyrus makes a declaration .
And that is what this cylinder is , the declaration made by the ruler guided by God who had toppled the Iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people .
In ringing Babylonian -- it was written in Babylonian -- he says , &quot; I am Cyrus , king of all the universe , the great king , the powerful king , king of Babylon , king of the four quarters of the world . &quot;
They &apos;re not shy of hyperbole as you can see .
This is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we &apos;ve got .
And it &apos;s written , as we &apos;ll see in due course , by very skilled P.R. consultants .
So the hyperbole is not actually surprising .
And what is the great king , the powerful king , the king of the four quarters of the world going to do ?
He goes on to say that , having conquered Babylon , he will at once let all the peoples that the Babylonians -- Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar -- have captured and enslaved go free .
He &apos;ll let them return to their countries .
And more important , he will let them all recover the gods , the statues , the temple vessels that had been confiscated .
All the peoples that the Babylonians had repressed and removed will go home , and they &apos;ll take with them their gods .
And they &apos;ll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way , in their own place .
This is the decree , this object is the evidence for the fact that the Jews , after the exile in Babylon , the years they &apos;d spent sitting by the waters of Babylon , weeping when they remembered Jerusalem , those Jews were allowed to go home .
They were allowed to return to Jerusalem and to rebuild the temple .
It &apos;s a central document in Jewish history .
And the Book of Chronicles , the Book of Ezra in the Hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms .
This is the Jewish version of the same story .
&quot; Thus said Cyrus , king of Persia , &apos; All the kingdoms of the earth have the Lord God of heaven given thee , and he has charged me to build him a house in Jerusalem .
Who is there among you of his people ?
The Lord God be with him , and let him go up . &apos; &quot; &quot; Go up &quot; -- aaleh .
The central element , still , of the notion of return , a central part of the life of Judaism .
As you all know , that return from exile , the second temple , reshaped Judaism .
And that change , that great historic moment , was made possible by Cyrus , the king of Persia , reported for us in Hebrew in scripture and in Babylonian in clay .
Two great texts , what about the politics ?
What was going on was the fundamental shift in Middle Eastern history .
The empire of Iran , the Medes and the Persians , united under Cyrus , became the first great world empire .
Cyrus begins in the 530s BC .
And by the time of his son Darius , the whole of the eastern Mediterranean is under Persian control .
This empire is , in fact , the Middle East as we now know it , and it &apos;s what shapes the Middle East as we now know it .
It was the largest empire the world had known until then .
Much more important , it was the first multicultural , multifaith state on a huge scale .
And it had to be run in a quite new way .
It had to be run in different languages .
The fact that this decree is in Babylonian says one thing .
And it had to recognize their different habits , different peoples , different religions , different faiths .
All of those are respected by Cyrus .
Cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational , multifaith , multicultural society .
And the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen , and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by Alexander .
It left a dream of the Middle East as a unit , and a unit where people of different faiths could live together .
The Greek invasions ended that .
And of course , Alexander couldn &apos;t sustain a government and it fragmented .
But what Cyrus represented remained absolutely central .
The Greek historian Xenophon wrote his book &quot; Cyropaedia &quot; promoting Cyrus as the great ruler .
And throughout European culture afterward , Cyrus remained the model .
This is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was .
And Xenophon &apos;s book on Cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the Founding Fathers of the American Revolution .
Jefferson was a great admirer -- the ideals of Cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state .
Meanwhile , back in Babylon , things had not been going well .
After Alexander , the other empires , Babylon declines , falls into ruins , and all the traces of the great Babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a British Museum exhibition digging in Babylon .
And it enters now another story .
It enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century : Are the scriptures reliable ? Can we trust them ?
We only knew about the return of the Jews and the decree of Cyrus from the Hebrew scriptures .
No other evidence .
Suddenly , this appeared .
And great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution , by geology , here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true .
It &apos;s a great 19th century moment .
But -- and this , of course , is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true , hurrah for archeology , but the interpretation was rather more complicated .
Because the cylinder account and the Hebrew Bible account differ in one key respect .
The Babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of Bablyon , Marduk .
And , not surprisingly , they tell you that all this was done by Marduk .
&quot; Marduk , we hold , called Cyrus by his name . &quot;
Marduk takes Cyrus by the hand , calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of Babylon .
Marduk tells Cyrus that he will do these great , generous things of setting the people free .
And this is why we should all be grateful to and worship Marduk .
The Hebrew writers in the Old Testament , you will not be surprised to learn , take a rather different view of this .
For them , of course , it can &apos;t possibly by Marduk that made all this happen .
It can only be Jehovah .
And so in Isaiah , we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this , not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name , also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people .
It &apos;s a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event , two different religious takeovers of a political fact .
God , we know , is usually on the side of the big battalions .
The question is , which god was it ?
And the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the Hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion .
And it &apos;s quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of Isaiah , and yet , Jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by Marduk .
And there &apos;s a slight sense that Isaiah knows this , because he says , this is God speaking , of course , &quot; I have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me . &quot;
I think it &apos;s recognized that Cyrus doesn &apos;t realize that he &apos;s acting under orders from Jehovah .
And equally , he &apos;d have been surprised that he was acting under orders from Marduk .
Because interestingly , of course , Cyrus is a good Iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts .
That &apos;s 1879 .
40 years on and we &apos;re in 1917 , and the cylinder enters a different world .
This time , the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the Balfour Declaration , the year when the new imperial power in the Middle East , Britain , decides that it will declare a Jewish national home , it will allow the Jews to return .
And the response to this by the Jewish population in Eastern Europe is rhapsodic .
And across Eastern Europe , Jews display pictures of Cyrus and of George V side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to Jerusalem .
And the Cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan .
You all know what happened .
The state of Israel is setup , and 50 years later , in the late 60s , it &apos;s clear that Britain &apos;s role as the imperial power is over .
And another story of the cylinder begins .
The region , the U.K. and the U.S. decide , has to be kept safe from communism , and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran , the Shah .
And so the Shah invents an Iranian history , or a return to Iranian history , that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the Cyrus cylinder .
When he has his great celebrations in Persepolis , he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the British Museum , goes to Tehran , and is part of those great celebrations of the Pahlavi dynasty .
Cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the Shah .
10 years later , another story : Iranian Revolution , 1979 .
Islamic revolution , no more Cyrus ; we &apos;re not interested in that history , we &apos;re interested in Islamic Iran -- until Iraq , the new superpower that we &apos;ve all decided should be in the region , attacks .
Then another Iran-Iraq war .
And it becomes critical for the Iranians to remember their great past , their great past when they fought Iraq and won .
It becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all Iranians -- Muslims and non-Muslims , Christians , Zoroastrians , Jews living in Iran , people who are devout , not devout .
And the obvious emblem is Cyrus .
So when the British Museum and Tehran National Musuem cooperate and work together , as we &apos;ve been doing , the Iranians ask for one thing only as a loan .
It &apos;s the only object they want .
They want to borrow the Cyrus cylinder .
And last year , the Cyrus cylinder went to Tehran for the second time .
It &apos;s shown being presented here , put into its case by the director of the National Museum of Tehran , one of the many women in Iran in very senior positions , Mrs. Ardakani .
It was a huge event .
This is the other side of that same picture .
It &apos;s seen in Tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months .
This is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the West .
And it &apos;s the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means , what Cyrus means , but above all , Cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- Cyrus as the defender of the homeland , the champion , of course , of Iranian identity and of the Iranian peoples , tolerant of all faiths .
And in the current Iran , Zoroastrians and Christians have guaranteed places in the Iranian parliament , something to be very , very proud of .
To see this object in Tehran , thousands of Jews living in Iran came to Tehran to see it .
It became a great emblem , a great subject of debate about what Iran is at home and abroad .
Is Iran still to be the defender of the oppressed ?
Will Iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated ?
This is heady national rhetoric , and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return .
Here you see this out-sized Cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from Iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of Iran .
It was a narrative presented by the president himself .
And for me , to take this object to Iran , to be allowed to take this object to Iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what Iran is , what different Irans there are and how the different histories of Iran might shape the world today .
It &apos;s a debate that &apos;s still continuing , and it will continue to rumble , because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration .
It stands with the American constitution .
It certainly says far more about real freedoms than Magna Carta .
It is a document that can mean so many things , for Iran and for the region .
A replica of this is at the United Nations .
In New York this autumn , it will be present when the great debates about the future of the Middle East take place .
And I want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures .
It will appear , certainly , in many more Middle Eastern stories .
And what story of the Middle East , what story of the world , do you want to see reflecting what is said , what is expressed in this cylinder ?
The right of peoples to live together in the same state , worshiping differently , freely -- a Middle East , a world , in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate .
In the world of the Middle East at the moment , the debates are , as you know , shrill .
But I think it &apos;s possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing , the Cyrus cylinder .
Thank you .
Joshua Klein : A thought experiment on the intelligence of crows
Hacker and writer Joshua Klein is fascinated by crows . After a long amateur study of corvid behavior , he &apos;s come up with an elegant thought experiment : a machine that could form a new bond between animal and human .
How many of you have seen the Alfred Hitchcock film &quot; The Birds &quot; ?
Any of you get really freaked out by that ?
You might want to leave now .
So , this is a vending machine for crows .
And over the past few days , many of you have been asking me , &quot; How did you come to this ? How did you get started doing this ? &quot;
And it started , as with many great ideas , or many ideas you can &apos;t get rid of anyway , at a cocktail party .
About 10 years ago , I was at a cocktail party with a friend of mine , and we &apos;re sitting there , and he was complaining about the crows that he had seen that were all over his yard and making a big mess .
And he was telling me that really , we ought to try and eradicate these things .
We gotta kill them because they &apos;re making a mess .
I said that was stupid , you know , maybe we should just train them to do something useful .
And he said that was impossible .
And I &apos;m sure I &apos;m in good company in finding that tremendously annoying -- when someone tells you it &apos;s impossible .
So , I spent the next 10 years reading about crows in my spare time .
And after 10 years of this , my wife eventually said , &quot; Look , you know , you gotta do this thing you &apos;ve been talking about , and build the vending machine . &quot;
So I did .
But part of the reason that I found this interesting is that I started noticing that we are very aware of all the species that are going extinct on the planet as a result of human habitation expansion , and no one seems to be paying attention to all the species that are actually living -- that are surviving .
And I &apos;m talking specifically about synanthropic species , which are species that have adapted specifically for human ecologies , species like rats and cockroaches and crows .
And as I started looking at them , I was finding that they had hyper-adapted .
They &apos;d become extremely adept at living with us .
And in return , we just tried to kill them all the time .
And in doing so , we were breeding them for parasitism .
We were giving them all sorts of reasons to adapt new ways .
So , for example , rats are incredibly responsive breeders .
And cockroaches , as anyone who &apos;s tried to get rid of them knows , have become really immune to the poisons that we &apos;re using .
So , I thought , let &apos;s build something that &apos;s mutually beneficial .
Well , then let &apos;s build something that we can both benefit from , and find some way to make a new relationship with these species .
And so I built the vending machine .
But the story of the vending machine is a little more interesting if you know more about crows .
It turns out that crows aren &apos;t just surviving with human beings -- they &apos;re actually really thriving .
They &apos;re found everywhere on the planet except for the Arctic and the southern tip of South America .
And in all that area , they &apos;re only rarely found breeding more than five kilometers away from human beings .
So we may not think about them , but they &apos;re always around .
And not surprisingly , given the human population growth , more than half of the human population is living in cities now .
And out of those , nine-tenths of the human growth population is occurring in cities .
We &apos;re seeing a population boom with crows .
So bird counts are indicating that we might be seeing up to exponential growth in their numbers .
So that &apos;s no great surprise .
But what was really interesting to me was to find out that the birds were adapting in a pretty unusual way .
And I &apos;ll give you an example of that .
So this is Betty . She &apos;s a New Caledonian crow .
And these crows use sticks in the wild to get insects and whatnot out of pieces of wood .
Here , she &apos;s trying to get a piece of meat out of a tube .
But the researchers had a problem .
They messed up and left just a stick of wire in there .
And she hadn &apos;t had the opportunity to do this before .
You see , it wasn &apos;t working very well .
So she adapted .
Now this is completely unprompted . She had never seen this done before .
No one taught her to bend this into a hook , had shown her how it could happen .
But she did it all on her own .
So keep in mind that she &apos;s never seen this done .
Right .
Yeah . All right .
That &apos;s the part where the researchers freak out .
So , it turns out we &apos;ve been finding more and more that crows are really , really intelligent .
Their brains are proportionate , in the same proportion as chimpanzee brains are .
There are all kinds of anecdotes for different kinds of intelligence they have .
For example , in Sweden , crows will wait for fishermen to drop lines through holes in the ice .
And when the fishermen move off , the crows fly down , reel up the lines , and eat the fish or the bait .
It &apos;s pretty annoying for the fishermen .
On an entirely different tack , at University of Washington , they , a few years ago , were doing an experiment where they captured some crows on campus .
Some students went out and netted some crows , brought them in , and were -- weighed them , and measured them and whatnot , and then let them back out again .
And were entertained to discover that for the rest of the week , these crows , whenever these particular students walked around campus , these crows would caw at them , and run around and make their life kind of miserable .
They were significantly less entertained when this went on for the next week .
And the next month . And after summer break .
Until they finally graduated and left campus , and -- glad to get away , I &apos;m sure -- came back sometime later , and found the crows still remembered them .
So -- the moral being , don &apos;t piss off crows .
So now , students at the University of Washington that are studying these crows do so with a giant wig and a big mask .
It &apos;s fairly interesting .
So we know that these crows are really smart , but the more I dug into this , the more I found that they actually have an even more significant adaptation .
Crows have become highly skilled at making a living in these new urban environments .
In this Japanese city , they have devised a way of eating a food that normally they can &apos;t manage : drop it among the traffic .
The problem now is collecting the bits , without getting run over .
Wait for the light to stop the traffic .
Then , collect your cracked nut in safety .
Joshua Klein : Yeah , yeah . Pretty interesting .
So what &apos;s significant about this isn &apos;t that crows are using cars to crack nuts .
In fact , that &apos;s old hat for crows .
This happened about 10 years ago in a place called Sendai City , at a driving school in the suburbs of Tokyo .
And since that time , all of the crows in the neighborhood are picking up this behavior .
And now , every crow within five kilometers is standing by a sidewalk , waiting to collect its lunch .
So , they &apos;re learning from each other . And research bears this out .
Parents seem to be teaching their young .
They &apos;ve learned from their peers . They &apos;ve learned from their enemies .
If I have a little extra time , I &apos;ll tell you about a case of crow infidelity that illustrates that nicely .
The point being that they &apos;ve developed cultural adaptation .
And as we heard yesterday , that &apos;s the Pandora &apos;s box that &apos;s getting human beings in trouble , and we &apos;re starting to see it with them .
They &apos;re able to very quickly and very flexibly adapt to new challenges and new resources in their environment , which is really useful if you live in a city .
So we know that there &apos;s lots of crows .
We found out they &apos;re really smart , and we found out that they can teach each other .
And when all this became clear to me , I realized the only obvious thing to do is build a vending machine .
So that &apos;s what we did .
This is a vending machine for crows .
And it uses Skinnerian training to shape their behavior over four stages .
It &apos;s pretty simple .
Basically , what happens is that we put this out in a field , or someplace where there &apos;s lots of crows , and we put coins and peanuts all around the base of the machine .
And crows eventually come by , and eat the peanuts and get used to the machine being there .
And eventually , they eat up all the peanuts .
And then they see that there are peanuts here on the feeder tray , and they hop up and help themselves .
And then they leave , and the machine spits up more coins and peanuts , and life is really dandy , if you &apos;re a crow .
Then you can come back anytime and get yourself a peanut .
So , when they get really used to that , we move on to the crows coming back .
Now , they &apos;re used to the sound of the machine , and they keep coming back , and digging out these peanuts from amongst the pile of coins that &apos;s there .
And when they get really happy about this , we go ahead and stymie them .
And we move to the third stage , where we only give them a coin .
Now , like most of us who have gotten used to a good thing , this really pisses them off .
So , they do what they do in nature when they &apos;re looking for something -- they sweep things out of the way with their beak .
And they do that here , and that knocks the coins down the slot , and when that happens , they get a peanut .
And so this goes on for some time .
The crows learn that all they have to do is show up , wait for the coin to come out , put the coin in the slot , and then they get their peanut .
And when they &apos;re really good and comfortable with that , we move to the final stage , in which they show up and nothing happens .
And this is where we see the difference between crows and other animals .
Squirrels , for example , would show up , look for the peanut , go away .
Come back , look for the peanut , go away .
They do this maybe half a dozen times before they get bored , and then they go off and play in traffic .
Crows , on the other hand , show up , and they try and figure it out .
They know that this machine &apos;s been messing with them , through three different stages of behavior .
They figure it &apos;s gotta have more to it .
So , they poke at it and peck at it and whatnot .
And eventually some crow gets a bright idea that , &quot; Hey , there &apos;s lots of coins lying around from the first stage , lying around on the ground , &quot; hops down , picks it up , drops it in the slot .
And then , we &apos;re off to the races .
That crow enjoys a temporary monopoly on peanuts , until his friends figure out how to do it , and then there we go .
So , what &apos;s significant about this to me isn &apos;t that we can train crows to pick up peanuts .
Mind you , there &apos;s 216 million dollars &apos; worth of change lost every year , but I &apos;m not sure I can depend on that ROI from crows .
Instead , I think we should look a little bit larger .
I think that crows can be trained to do other things .
For example , why not train them to pick up garbage after stadium events ?
Or find expensive components from discarded electronics ?
Or maybe do search and rescue ?
The main thing , the main point of all this for me is that we can find mutually beneficial systems for these species .
We can find ways to interact with these other species that doesn &apos;t involve exterminating them , but involves finding an equilibrium with them that &apos;s a useful balance .
Thanks very much .
David Logan : Tribal leadership
David Logan talks about the five kinds of tribes that humans naturally form -- in schools , workplaces , even the driver &apos;s license bureau . By understanding our shared tribal tendencies , we can help lead each other to become better individuals .
What we &apos;re really here to talk about is the &quot; how . &quot;
Okay , so how exactly do we create this world-shattering , if you will , innovation ?
Now , I want to tell you a quick story .
We &apos;ll go back a little more than a year .
In fact , the date -- I &apos;m curious to know if any of you know what happened on this momentous date ?
It was February 3rd , 2008 .
Anyone remember what happened , February 3rd , 2008 ?
Super Bowl . I heard it over here . It was the date of the Super Bowl .
And the reason that this date was so momentous is that what my colleagues , John King and Halee Fischer-Wright , and I noticed as we began to debrief various Super Bowl parties , is that it seemed to us that across the United States , if you will , tribal councils had convened .
And they had discussed things of great national importance .
Like , &quot; Do we like the Budweiser commercial ? &quot;
and , &quot; Do we like the nachos ? &quot; and , &quot; Who is going to win ? &quot;
But they also talked about which candidate they were going to support .
And if you go back in time to February 3rd , it looked like Hilary Clinton was going to get the Democratic nomination .
And there were even some polls that were saying she was going to go all the way .
But when we talked to people , it appeared that a funnel effect had happened in these tribes all across the United States .
Now what is a tribe ? A tribe is a group of about 20 -- so kind of more than a team -- 20 to about 150 people .
And it &apos;s within these tribes that all of our work gets done .
But not just work . It &apos;s within these tribes that societies get built , that important things happen .
And so as we surveyed the , if you will , representatives from various tribal councils that met , also known as Super Bowl parties , we sent the following email off to 40 newspaper editors the following day .
February 4th , we posted it on our website . This was before Super Tuesday .
We said , &quot; The tribes that we &apos;re in are saying it &apos;s going to be Obama . &quot;
Now , the reason we knew that was because we spent the previous 10 years studying tribes , studying these naturally occurring groups .
All of you are members of tribes .
In walking around at the break , many of you had met members of your tribe . And you were talking to them .
And many of you were doing what great , if you will , tribal leaders do , which is to find someone who is a member of a tribe , and to find someone else who is another member of a different tribe , and make introductions .
That is in fact what great tribal leaders do .
So here is the bottom line .
If you focus in on a group like this -- this happens to be a USC game -- and you zoom in with one of those super satellite cameras and do magnification factors so you could see individual people , you would in fact see not a single crowd , just like there is not a single crowd here , but you would see these tribes that are then coming together .
And from a distance it appears that it &apos;s a single group .
And so people form tribes .
They always have . They always will .
Just as fish swim and birds fly , people form tribes . It &apos;s just what we do .
But here &apos;s the rub .
Not all tribes are the same , and what makes the difference is the culture .
Now here is the net out of this .
You &apos;re all a member of tribes .
If you can find a way to take the tribes that you &apos;re in and nudge them forward , along these tribal stages to what we call Stage Five , which is the top of the mountain .
But we &apos;re going to start with what we call Stage One .
Now , this is the lowest of the stages .
You don &apos;t want this . Okay ?
This is a bit of a difficult image to put up on the screen .
But it &apos;s one that I think we need to learn from .
Stage One produces people who do horrible things .
This is the kid who shot up Virginia Tech .
Stage One is a group where people systematically sever relationships from functional tribes , and then pool together with people who think like they do .
Stage One is literally the culture of gangs and it is the culture of prisons .
Now , again , we don &apos;t often deal with Stage One .
And I want to make the point that as members of society , we need to .
It &apos;s not enough to simply write people off .
But let &apos;s move on to Stage Two .
Now , Stage One , you &apos;ll notice , says , in effect , &quot; Life Sucks . &quot;
So , this other book that Steve mentioned , that just came out , called &quot; The Three Laws of Performance , &quot; my colleague , Steve Zaffron and I , argue that as people see the world , so they behave .
Well , if people see the world in such a way that life sucks , then their behavior will follow automatically from that .
It will be despairing hostility .
They &apos;ll do whatever it takes to survive , even if that means undermining other people .
Now , my birthday is coming up shortly , and my driver &apos;s license expires .
And the reason that that &apos;s relevant is that very soon I will be walking into what we call a Stage Two tribe , which looks like this .
Now , am I saying that in every Department of Motor Vehicles across the land , you find a Stage Two culture ?
No . But in the one near me , where I have to go in just a few days , what I will say when I &apos;m standing in line is , &quot; How can people be so dumb , and yet live ? &quot;
Now , am I saying that there are dumb people working here ?
Actually , no , I &apos;m not .
But I &apos;m saying the culture makes people dumb .
So in a Stage Two culture -- and we find these in all sorts of different places -- you find them , in fact , in the best organizations in the world .
You find them in all places in society .
I &apos;ve come across them at the organizations that everybody raves about as being best in class .
But here is the point . If you believe and you say to people in your tribe , in effect , &quot; My life sucks .
I mean , if I got to go to TEDx USC my life wouldn &apos;t suck . But I don &apos;t . So it does . &quot;
If that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
What kind of innovation would get done ?
The amount of world-changing behavior that would happen ?
In fact it would be basically nil .
Now when we go on to Stage Three : this is the one that hits closest to home for many of us .
Because it is in Stage Three that many of us move .
And we park . And we stay .
Stage Three says , &quot; I &apos;m great . And you &apos;re not . &quot;
I &apos;m great and you &apos;re not .
Now imagine having a whole room of people saying , in effect , &quot; I &apos;m great and you &apos;re not . &quot;
Or , &quot; I &apos;m going to find some way to compete with you and come out on top as a result of that . &quot;
A whole group of people communicating that way , talking that way .
I know this sounds like a joke . Three doctors walk into a bar .
But , in this case , three doctors walk into an elevator .
I happened to be in the elevator collecting data for this book .
And one doctor said to the others , &quot; Did you see my article in the New England Journal of Medicine ? &quot;
And the other said , &quot; No . That &apos;s great . Congratulations ! &quot;
The next one got kind of a wry smile on his face and said , &quot; Well while you were , you know , doing your research , &quot; -- notice the condescending tone -- &quot; While you were off doing your research , I was off doing more surgeries than anyone else in the department of surgery at this institution . &quot;
And the third one got the same wry smile and said , &quot; Well , while you were off doing your research , and you were off doing your monkey meatball surgery , that eventually we &apos;ll train monkeys to do , or cells or robots , or maybe not even need to do it at all , I was off running the future of the residency program , which is really the future of medicine . &quot;
And they all kind of laughed and they patted him on the back .
And the elevator door opened , and they all walked out .
That is a meeting of a Stage Three tribe .
Now , we find these in places where really smart , successful people show up .
Like , oh , I don &apos;t know , TEDx USC .
Here is the greatest challenge we face in innovation .
It is moving from Stage Three to Stage Four .
Let &apos;s take a look at a quick video snippet .
This is from a company called Zappos , located outside Las Vegas .
And my question on the other side is just going to be , &quot; What do you think they value ? &quot;
It was not Christmas time . There was a Christmas tree .
This is their lobby .
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
Notice it looks like something out of a Peanuts cartoon .
Okay , we &apos;re going through the hallway here at Zappos .
This is a call center . Notice how it &apos;s decorated .
Notice people are applauding for us .
They don &apos;t know who we are and they don &apos;t care . And if they did they probably wouldn &apos;t applaud .
But you &apos;ll notice the level of excitement .
Notice , again , how they decorate their office .
Now , what &apos;s important to people at Zappos , these may not be the things that are important to you .
But they value things like fun . And they value creativity .
One of their stated values is , &quot; Be a little bit weird . &quot;
And you &apos;ll notice they are a little bit weird .
So when individuals come together and find something that unites them that &apos;s greater than their individual competence , then something very important happens .
The group gels . And it changes from a group of highly motivated but fairly individually-centric people into something larger , into a tribe that becomes aware of its own existence .
Stage Four tribes can do remarkable things .
But you &apos;ll notice we &apos;re not at the top of the mountain yet .
There is , in fact , another stage .
Now , some of you may not recognize the scene that &apos;s up here .
And if you take a look at the headline of Stage Five , which is &quot; Life is Great , &quot; this may seem a little incongruous .
This is a scene or snippet from the Truth and Reconciliation process in South Africa for which Desmond Tutu won the Nobel Prize .
Now think about that . South Africa , terrible atrocities had happened in the society .
And people came together focused only on those two values : truth and reconciliation .
There was no road map . No one had ever done anything like this before .
And in this atmosphere , where the only guidance was people &apos;s values and their noble cause , what this group accomplished was historic .
And people , at the time , feared that South Africa would end up going the way that Rwanda has gone , descending into one skirmish after another in a civil war that seems to have no end .
In fact , South Africa has not gone down that road .
Largely because people like Desmond Tutu set up a Stage Five process to involve the thousands and perhaps millions of tribes in the country , to bring everyone together .
So , people hear this and they conclude the following , as did we in doing the study .
Okay , got it . I don &apos;t want to talk Stage One .
That &apos;s like , you know , &quot; Life sucks . &quot; Who wants to talk that way ?
I don &apos;t want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that &apos;s close to where Dave lives .
I really don &apos;t want to just say &quot; I &apos;m great , &quot; because that kind of sounds narcissistic , and then I won &apos;t have any friends .
Saying , &quot; We &apos;re great &quot; -- that sounds pretty good .
But I should really talk Stage Five , right ? &quot; Life is great . &quot;
Well , in fact , there are three somewhat counter-intuitive findings that come out of all this .
The first one , if you look at the Declaration of Independence and actually read it , the phrase that sticks in many of our minds is things about inalienable rights .
I mean , that &apos;s Stage Five , right ? Life is great , oriented only by our values , no other guidance .
In fact , most of the document is written at Stage Two .
&quot; My life sucks because I live under a tyrant , also known as King George .
We &apos;re great ! Who is not great ? England ! &quot;
Sorry .
Well , what about other great leaders ? What about Gandhi ?
What about Martin Luther King ?
I mean , surely these were just people who preached , &quot; Life is great , &quot; right ?
Just one little bit of happiness and joy after another .
In fact , Martin Luther King &apos;s most famous line was at Stage Three .
He didn &apos;t say &quot; We have a dream . &quot; He said , &quot; I have a dream . &quot;
Why did he do that ? Because most people are not at Stage Five .
Two percent are at Stage One .
About 25 percent are at Stage Two , saying , in effect , &quot; My life sucks . &quot;
48 percent of working tribes say , these are employed tribes , say , &quot; I &apos;m great and you &apos;re not . &quot;
And we have to duke it out every day , so we resort to politics .
Only about 22 percent of tribes are at Stage Four , oriented by our values , saying &quot; We &apos;re great .
And our values are beginning to unite us . &quot;
Only two percent , only two percent of tribes get to Stage Five .
And those are the ones that change the world .
So the first little finding from this is that leaders need to be able to talk all the levels so that you can touch every person in society .
But you don &apos;t leave them where you found them . Okay ?
Tribes can only hear one level above and below where they are .
So we have to have the ability to talk all the levels , to go to where they are .
And then leaders nudge people within their tribes to the next level .
I &apos;d like to show you some examples of this .
One of the people we interviewed was Frank Jordan , former Mayor of San Francisco . Before that he was Chief of Police in San Francisco .
And he grew up essentially in Stage One .
And you know what changed his life ? It was walking into one of these , a Boys and Girls Club .
Now here is what happened to this person who eventually became Mayor of San Francisco .
He went from being alive and passionate at Stage One -- remember , &quot; Life sucks , despairing hostility , I will do whatever it takes to survive &quot; -- to walking into a Boys and Girls Club , folding his arms , sitting down in a chair , and saying , &quot; Wow . My life really sucks .
I don &apos;t know anybody .
I mean , if I was into boxing , like they were , then my life wouldn &apos;t suck . But I don &apos;t . So it does .
So I &apos;m going to sit here in my chair and not do anything . &quot;
In fact , that &apos;s progress .
We move people from Stage One to Stage Two by getting them in a new tribe and then , over time , getting them connected .
So , what about moving from Stage Three to Stage Four ?
I want to argue that we &apos;re doing that right here .
TED represents a set of values , and as we unite around these values , something really interesting begins to emerge .
If you want this experience to live on as something historic , then at the reception tonight I &apos;d like to encourage you to do something beyond what people normally do and call networking .
Which is not just to meet new people and extend your reach , extend your influence , but instead , find someone you don &apos;t know , and find someone else you don &apos;t know , and introduce them .
That &apos;s called a triadic relationship .
See , people who build world-changing tribes do that .
They extend the reach of their tribes by connecting them , not just to myself , so that my following is greater , but I connect people who don &apos;t know each other to something greater than themselves .
And ultimately that adds to their values .
But we &apos;re not done yet . Because then how do we go from Stage Four , which is great , to Stage Five ?
The story that I like to end with is this . It comes out of a place called the Gallup Organization .
You know they do polls , right ?
So it &apos;s Stage Four . We &apos;re great . Who is not great ?
Pretty much everybody else who does polls .
If Gallup releases a poll on the same day that NBC releases a poll , people will pay attention to the Gallup poll . Okay , we understand that .
So , they were bored .
They wanted to change the world . So here is the question someone asked .
&quot; How could we , instead of just polling what Asia thinks or what the United States thinks , or who thinks what about Obama versus McCain or something like that , what does the entire world think ? &quot;
And they found a way to do the first-ever world poll .
They had people involved who were Nobel laureates in economics , who reported being bored .
And suddenly they pulled out sheets of paper and were trying to figure out , &quot; How do we survey the population of Sub-Saharan Africa ?
How do we survey populations that don &apos;t have access to technology , and speak languages we don &apos;t speak , and we don &apos;t know anyone who speaks those languages . Because in order to achieve on this great mission , we have to be able to do it .
Incidentally , they did pull it off .
And they released the first-ever world poll .
So I &apos;d like to leave you with these thoughts .
First of all : we all form tribes , all of us .
You &apos;re in tribes here . Hopefully you &apos;re extending the reach of the tribes that you have .
But the question on the table is this : What kind of an impact are the tribes that you are in making ?
You &apos;re hearing one presentation after another , often representing a group of people , a tribe , about how they have changed the world .
If you do what we &apos;ve talked about , you listen for how people actually communicate in the tribes that you &apos;re in .
And you don &apos;t leave them where they are . You nudge them forward .
You remember to talk all five culture stages .
Because we &apos;ve got people in all five , around us .
And the question that I &apos;d like to leave you with is this : Will your tribes change the world ?
Thank you very much .
Frederick Balagadde : Bio-lab on a microchip
Drugs alone can &apos;t stop disease in sub-Saharan Africa : We need diagnostic tools to match . TED Senior Fellow Frederick Balagadde shows how we can multiply the power and availability of an unwieldy , expensive diagnostic lab -- by miniaturizing it to the size of a chip .
The greatest irony in global health is that the poorest countries carry the largest disease burden .
If we resize the countries of the globe in proportion to the subject of interest , we see that Sub-Saharan Africa is the worst hit region by HIV / AIDS .
This is the most devastating epidemic of our time .
We also see that this region has the least capability in terms of dealing with the disease .
There are very few doctors and , quite frankly , these countries do not have the resources that are needed to cope with such epidemics .
So what the Western countries , developed countries , have generously done is they have proposed to provide free drugs to all people in Third World countries who actually can &apos;t afford these medications .
And this has already saved millions of lives , and it has prevented entire economies from capsizing in Sub-Saharan Africa .
But there is a fundamental problem that is killing the efforts in fighting this disease , because if you keep throwing drugs out at people who don &apos;t have diagnostic services , you end up creating a problem of drug resistance .
This is already beginning to happen in Sub-Saharan Africa .
The problem is that , what begins as a tragedy in the Third World could easily become a global problem .
And the last thing we want to see is drug-resistant strains of HIV popping up all over the world , because it will make treatment more expensive and it could also restore the pre-ARV carnage of HIV / AIDS .
I experienced this firsthand as a high school student in Uganda .
This was in the 90s during the peak of the HIV epidemic , before there were any ARVs in Sub-Saharan Africa .
And during that time , I actually lost more relatives , as well as the teachers who taught me , to HIV / AIDS .
So this became one of the driving passions of my life , to help find real solutions that could address these kinds of problems .
We all know about the miracle of miniaturization .
Back in the day , computers used to fill this entire room , and people actually used to work inside the computers .
But what electronic miniaturization has done is that it has allowed people to shrink technology into a cell phone .
And I &apos;m sure everyone here enjoys cell phones that can actually be used in the remote areas of the world , in the Third World countries .
The good news is that the same technology that allowed miniaturization of electronics is now allowing us to miniaturize biological laboratories .
So , right now , we can actually miniaturize biological and chemistry laboratories onto microfluidic chips .
I was very lucky to come to the US right after high school , and was able to work on this technology and develop some devices .
This is a microfluidic chip that I developed .
A close look at how the technology works : These are channels that are about the size of a human hair -- so you have integrated valves , pumps , mixers and injectors -- so you can fit entire diagnostic experiments onto a microfluidic system .
So what I plan to do with this technology is to actually take the current state of the technology and build an HIV kit in a microfluidic system .
So , with one microfluidic chip , which is the size of an iPhone , you can actually diagnose 100 patients at the same time .
For each patient , we will be able to do up to 100 different viral loads per patient .
And this is only done in four hours , 50 times faster than the current state of the art , at a cost that will be five to 500 times cheaper than the current options .
So this will allow us to create personalized medicines in the Third World at a cost that is actually achievable and make the world a safer place .
I invite your interest as well as your involvement in driving this vision to a point of practical reality .
Thank you very much .
Jonathan Drori : The beautiful tricks of flowers
In this visually dazzling talk , Jonathan Drori shows the extraordinary ways flowering plants -- over a quarter million species -- have evolved to attract insects to spread their pollen : growing &apos; landing-strips &apos; to guide the insects in , shining in ultraviolet , building elaborate traps , and even mimicking other insects in heat .
Do you know how many species of flowering plants there are ?
There are a quarter of a million -- at least those are the ones we know about -- a quarter of a million species of flowering plants .
And flowers are a real bugger .
They &apos;re really difficult for plants to produce .
They take an enormous amount of energy and a lot of resources .
Why would they go to that bother ?
And the answer of course , like so many things in the world , is sex .
I know what &apos;s on your mind when you &apos;re looking at these pictures .
And the reason that sexual reproduction is so important -- there are lots of other things that plants can do to reproduce .
You can take cuttings ; they can sort of have sex with themselves ; they can pollinate themselves .
But they really need to spread their genes to mix with other genes so that they can adapt to environmental niches .
Evolution works that way .
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen .
Some of you may have seen some of these pictures before .
As I say , every home should have a scanning electron microscope to be able to see these .
And there is as many different kinds of pollen as there are flowering plants .
And that &apos;s actually rather useful for forensics and so on .
Most pollen that causes hay fever for us is from plants that use the wind to disseminate the pollen , and that &apos;s a very inefficient process , which is why it gets up our noses so much .
Because you have to chuck out masses and masses of it , hoping that your sex cells , your male sex cells , which are held within the pollen , will somehow reach another flower just by chance .
So all the grasses , which means all of the cereal crops , and most of the trees have wind-borne pollen .
But most species actually use insects to do their bidding , and that &apos;s more intelligent in a way , because the pollen , they don &apos;t need so much of it .
The insects and other species can take the pollen , transfer it directly to where it &apos;s required .
So we &apos;re aware , obviously , of the relationship between insects and plants .
There &apos;s a symbiotic relationship there , whether it &apos;s flies or birds or bees , they &apos;re getting something in return , and that something in return is generally nectar .
Sometimes that symbiosis has led to wonderful adaptations -- the hummingbird hawk-moth is beautiful in its adaptation .
The plant gets something , and the hawk-moth spreads the pollen somewhere else .
Plants have evolved to create little landing strips here and there for bees that might have lost their way .
There are markings on many plants that look like other insects .
These are the anthers of a lily , cleverly done so that when the unsuspecting insect lands on it , the anther flips up and whops it on the back with a great load of pollen that it then goes to another plant with .
And there &apos;s an orchid that might look to you as if it &apos;s got jaws , and in a way , it has ; it forces the insect to crawl out , getting covered in pollen that it takes somewhere else .
Orchids : there are 20,000 , at least , species of orchids -- amazingly , amazingly diverse .
And they get up to all sorts of tricks .
They have to try and attract pollinators to do their bidding .
This orchid , known as Darwin &apos;s orchid , because it &apos;s one that he studied and made a wonderful prediction when he saw it -- you can see that there &apos;s a very long nectar tube that descends down from the orchid .
And basically what the insect has to do -- we &apos;re in the middle of the flower -- it has to stick its little proboscis right into the middle of that and all the way down that nectar tube to get to the nectar .
And Darwin said , looking at this flower , &quot; I guess something has coevolved with this . &quot;
And sure enough , there &apos;s the insect .
And I mean , normally it kind of rolls it away , but in its erect form , that &apos;s what it looks like .
Now you can imagine that if nectar is such a valuable thing and expensive for the plant to produce and it attracts lots of pollinators , then , just as in human sex , people might start to deceive .
They might say , &quot; I &apos;ve got a bit of nectar . Do you want to come and get it ? &quot;
Now this is a plant .
This is a plant here that insects in South Africa just love , and they &apos;ve evolved with a long proboscis to get the nectar at the bottom .
And this is the mimic .
So this is a plant that is mimicking the first plant .
And here is the long-probosced fly that has not gotten any nectar from the mimic , because the mimic doesn &apos;t give it any nectar . It thought it would get some .
So not only has the fly not got the nectar from the mimic plant , it &apos;s also -- if you look very closely just at the head end , you can see that it &apos;s got a bit of pollen that it would be transmitting to another plant , if only some botanist hadn &apos;t come along and stuck it to a blue piece of card .
Now deceit carries on through the plant kingdom .
This flower with its black dots : they might look like black dots to us , but if I tell you , to a male insect of the right species , that looks like two females who are really , really hot to trot .
And when the insect gets there and lands on it , dousing itself in pollen , of course , that it &apos;s going to take to another plant , if you look at the every-home-should-have-one scanning electron microscope picture , you can see that there are actually some patterning there , which is three-dimensional .
So it probably even feels good for the insect , as well as looking good .
And these electron microscope pictures -- here &apos;s one of an orchid mimicking an insect -- you can see that different parts of the structure have different colors and different textures to our eye , have very , very different textures to what an insect might perceive .
And this one is evolved to mimic a glossy metallic surface you see on some beetles .
And under the scanning electron microscope , you can see the surface there -- really quite different from the other surfaces we looked at .
Sometimes the whole plant mimics an insect , even to us .
I mean , I think that looks like some sort of flying animal or beast .
It &apos;s a wonderful , amazing thing .
This one &apos;s clever . It &apos;s called obsidian .
I think of it as insidium sometimes .
To the right species of bee , this looks like another very aggressive bee , and it goes and bonks it on the head lots and lots of times to try and drive it away , and , of course , covers itself with pollen .
The other thing it does is that this plant mimics another orchid that has a wonderful store of food for insects .
And this one doesn &apos;t have anything for them .
So it &apos;s deceiving on two levels -- fabulous .
Here we see ylang ylang , the component of many perfumes .
I actually smelt someone with some on earlier .
And the flowers don &apos;t really have to be that gaudy .
They &apos;re sending out a fantastic array of scent to any insect that &apos;ll have it .
This one doesn &apos;t smell so good .
This is a flower that really , really smells pretty nasty and is designed , again , evolved , to look like carrion .
So flies love this .
They fly in and they pollinate .
This , which is helicodiceros , is also known as dead horse arum .
I don &apos;t know what a dead horse actually smells like , but this one probably smells pretty much like it .
It &apos;s really horrible .
And blowflies just can &apos;t help themselves .
They fly into this thing , and they fly all the way down it .
They lay their eggs in it , thinking it &apos;s a nice bit of carrion , and not realizing that there &apos;s no food for the eggs , that the eggs are going to die , but the plant , meanwhile , has benefited , because the bristles release and the flies disappear to pollinate the next flower -- fantastic .
Here &apos;s arum , arum maculatum , &quot; lords and ladies , &quot; or &quot; cuckoo-pint &quot; in this country .
I photographed this thing last week in Dorset .
This thing heats up by about 15 degrees above ambient temperature -- amazing .
And if you look down into it , there &apos;s this sort of dam past the spadix , flies get attracted by the heat -- which is boiling off volatile chemicals , little midges -- and they get trapped underneath in this container .
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they &apos;re all a bit sticky .
At night they get covered in pollen , which showers down over them , and then the bristles that we saw above , they sort of wilt and allow all these midges out , covered in pollen -- fabulous thing .
Now if you think that &apos;s fabulous , this is one of my great favorites .
This is the philodendron selloum .
For anyone here from Brazil , you &apos;ll know about this plant .
This is the most amazing thing .
That sort of phallic bit there is about a foot long .
And it does something that no other plant that I know of does , and that is that when it flowers -- that &apos;s the spadix in the middle there -- for a period of about two days , it metabolizes in a way which is rather similar to mammals .
So instead of having starch , which is the food of plants , it takes something rather similar to brown fat and burns it at such a rate that it &apos;s burning fat , metabolizing , about the rate of a small cat .
And that &apos;s twice the energy output , weight for weight , than a hummingbird -- absolutely astonishing .
This thing does something else which is unusual .
Not only will it raise itself to 115 Fahrenheit , 43 or 44 degrees Centigrade , for two days , but it keeps constant temperature .
There &apos;s a thermoregulation mechanism in there that keeps constant temperature .
&quot; Now why does it do this , &quot; I hear you ask .
Now wouldn &apos;t you know it , there &apos;s some beetles that just love to make love at that temperature .
And they get inside , and they get it all on .
And the plant showers them with pollen , and off they go and pollinate .
And what a wonderful thing it is .
Now most pollinators that we think about are insects , but actually in the tropics , many birds and butterflies pollinate .
And many of the tropical flowers are red , and that &apos;s because butterflies and birds see similarly to us , we think , and can see the color red very well .
But if you look at the spectrum , birds and us , we see red , green and blue and see that spectrum .
Insects see green , blue and ultraviolet , and they see various shades of ultraviolet .
So there &apos;s something that goes on off the end there .
&quot; And wouldn &apos;t it be great if we could somehow see what that is , &quot; I hear you ask .
Well yes we can .
So what is an insect seeing ?
Last week I took these pictures of rock rose , helianthemum , in Dorset .
These are little yellow flowers like we all see , little yellow flowers all over the place .
And this is what it looks like with visible light .
This is what it looks like if you take out the red .
Most bees don &apos;t perceive red .
And then I put some ultraviolet filters on my camera and took a very , very long exposure with the particular frequencies of ultraviolet light and this is what I got .
And that &apos;s a real fantastic bull &apos;s eye .
Now we don &apos;t know exactly what a bee sees , any more than you know what I &apos;m seeing when I call this red .
We can &apos;t know what &apos;s going on in -- let alone an insect &apos;s -- another human being &apos;s mind .
But the contrast will look something like that , so standing out a lot from the background .
Here &apos;s another little flower -- different range of ultraviolet frequencies , different filters to match the pollinators .
And that &apos;s the sort of thing that it would be seeing .
Just in case you think that all yellow flowers have this property -- no flower was damaged in the process of this shot ; it was just attached to the tripod , not killed -- then under ultraviolet light , look at that .
And that could be the basis of a sunscreen because sunscreens work by absorbing ultraviolet light .
So maybe the chemical in that would be useful .
Finally , there &apos;s one of evening primrose that Bjorn Rorslett from Norway sent me -- fantastic hidden pattern .
And I love the idea of something hidden .
I think there &apos;s something poetic here , that these pictures taken with ultraviolet filter , the main use of that filter is for astronomers to take pictures of Venus -- actually the clouds of Venus .
That &apos;s the main use of that filter .
Venus , of course , is the god of love and fertility , which is the flower story .
And just as flowers spend a lot of effort trying to get pollinators to do their bidding , they &apos;ve also somehow managed to persuade us to plant great fields full of them and give them to each other at times of birth and death , and particularly at marriage , which , when you think of it , is the moment that encapsulates the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another .
Thank you very much .
Srdja Popovic : How to topple a dictator
2011 was a year of people-powered resistance , starting with Arab Spring and spreading across the world . How did it work ? Srdja Popovic lays out the plans , skills and tools each movement needs -- from nonviolent tactics to a sense of humor . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Good afternoon . I am proud to be here at TEDxKrakow .
I &apos;ll try to speak a little bit today about a phenomenon which can and is actually changing the world , and whose name is people power .
I &apos;ll start with the anecdote , or for those of you who are Monty Python lovers , a Monty Python type of sketch .
Here it is . It is December 15 , 2010 .
Somebody gives you a bet . You will look at a crystal ball and you will see the future . The future will be accurate .
But you need to share it with the world . Okay ?
Curiosity killed the cat . You take the bet .
You look at the crystal ball . One hour later , you are sitting in a building on the national TV in a talkshow , and you tell the story .
&quot; Before the end of 2011 , Ben Ali and Mubarak and Gaddafi will be down and prosecuted .
Saleh of Yemen and Assad of Syria would be either challenged or already on their knees .
Osama bin Laden will be dead , and Ratko Mladic will be in the Hague . &quot;
Now , the anchor watches you with a strange gaze on his face , and then on the top of it you add , &quot; And thousands of the young people from Athens , Madrid and New York will demonstrate for social justice , claiming that they are inspired with Arabs . &quot;
Next thing you know , two guys in white appear .
They give you the strange t-shirt , take you to the nearest mental institution .
So I would like to speak a little bit about the phenomenon which is behind what already seems to be the very bad year for bad guys , and this phenomenon is called people power .
Well , people power has been there for a while .
It helped Gandhi kick the Brits from India .
It helped Martin Luther King win a historic racial struggle .
It helped local Lech Walesa to kick out one million Soviet troops from Poland and beginning the end of the Soviet Union as we know it .
So what &apos;s new in it ? What seems to be very new , which is the idea I would like to share with you today , that there is a set of rules and skills which can be learned and taught in order to perform successful nonviolent struggle .
If this is true , we can help these movements .
Well , first one , analytic skills .
I &apos;ll try where it all started in the Middle East , and for so many years we were living with completely the wrong perception of the Middle East .
It was looking like the frozen region , literally a refrigerator , and there are only two types of meals there : steak , which stands for a Mubarak , Ben Ali-type of military police dictatorship , or a potato , which stands for Tehran types of theocracies .
And everybody was amazed when the refrigerator opened and millions of young , mainly secular people step out to do the change . Guess what ? They didn &apos;t watch the demographics .
What is the average age of Egyptians ? 24 .
How long was Mubarak in power ? 31 .
So this system : just obsolete . They expired , and young people of the Arab World have awakened one morning and understood that power lies in their hands .
The rest is the year in front of us . And guess what ?
The same Generation Epsilon with their rules , with their tools , with their games and with their language , which sounds a little bit strange to me . I am 38 now .
And can you look at the age of the people on the streets of Europe ?
It seems that Generation Epsilon is coming .
Now let me set another example .
I &apos;m meeting different people throughout the world , and they are , you know , academics and professors and doctors , and they will always talk conditions .
They will say , &quot; People power will work only if the regime is not too oppressive . &quot;
They will say , &quot; People power will work if the annual income of the country is between X and Z. &quot;
They will say , &quot; People power will work only if there is a foreign pressure . &quot;
They will say , &quot; People power will work only if there is no oil . &quot;
And , I mean , there is a set of conditions .
Well , the news here is that your skills &#91; that you &#93; bring in the conflict seem to be more important than the conditions , namely skills of unity , planning , and maintaining nonviolent discipline .
Let me give you the example .
I am coming from a country called Serbia .
It took us 10 years to unite 18 opposition party leaders , with their big egos , behind one single candidate against Balkan dictator Slobodan Milosevic .
Guess what ? That was the day of his defeat .
You look at the Egyptians , they fire on Tahrir Square , they get rid of their individual symbols .
They appear on the street only with the flag of Egypt .
I will give you a counter-example .
You see nine presidential candidates running against Lukashenko .
You will know the outcome .
So unity is a big thing , and this can be achieved .
Same with planning . Somebody has lied to you about the successful and spontaneous nonviolent revolution ?
That thing doesn &apos;t exist in the world .
Whenever you see young people in front of the road trying to fraternize with the police or military , somebody was thinking about it before .
Now , at the end , nonviolent discipline , and this is probably the game-changer .
If you maintain nonviolent discipline , you will exclusively win .
You have 100,000 people in a nonviolent march , and one idiot or agent provocateur is throwing stones , guess what takes all the cameras ? That one guy .
One single act of violence can literally destroy your movement .
Now let me move to another place .
It &apos;s selection of strategies and tactics .
There are certain rules in nonviolent struggle you may follow .
First , you start small .
Second , you pick the battles you can win .
It &apos;s only 200 of us in this room .
We won &apos;t call for the March of Millions .
But what if we organize spraying graffiti throughout the night all over Krakow city ? The city will know .
So we pick the tactics which accommodates to the event , especially this thing we call the small tactics of dispersion .
They &apos;re very useful in a violent oppression .
We are actually witnessing the picture of one of the best tactics ever used .
It was on Tahrir Square , where the international community was constantly frightened that the Islamists will overtake the revolution . Well , they &apos;ve organized Christians protecting Muslims , who are there praying , Coptic wedding cheered by thousands of Muslims .
The world has just changed the picture , but somebody was thinking about this previously .
So there are so many things you can do instead of getting into one place , shouting and showing off in front of the security forces .
Now there is also another very important dynamic , and this is a dynamic normally analytics don &apos;t see .
This is dynamics between fear and apathy on one side and enthusiasm and humor on another side .
So it works like in a video game .
You have a fear high , you have status quo .
You have enthusiasm higher , you see fear starting to melt .
Day two , you see people running towards police instead of from the police .
In Egypt , you can tell that something is happening there .
And then it &apos;s about humor . Humor is such a powerful game-changer , and of course it was very big in Poland .
And you know , we were just a small group of crazy students in Serbia when we made this big skit .
We put the big petrol barrel with a portrait picture of Mr. President on it in the middle of the Main Street . There was a hole on the top so you could literally come , put a coin in , get a baseball bat , and pow , hit his face .
Sounds loud . And within the minutes , we were sitting in a nearby cafe having coffee , and there was a queue of people waiting to do this lovely thing .
Well , that &apos;s just the beginning of the show .
The real show starts when the police appears .
What will they do ? Arrest us ? We are nowhere to be seen .
We are three blocks away observing it from our espresso bar .
Arrest the shoppers with kids ? Doesn &apos;t make sense .
Of course , you could bet they have done the most stupid thing : They arrested the barrel . And now the picture of the smashed face on the barrel with the policeman dragging them to the police car , that was the best day for the photographers from newspapers that they ever will have .
So , I mean , these are the things you can do , and you can always use the humor .
There is also one big thing about the humor : It really hurts , because these guys really are taking themselves too seriously .
When you start to mock them , it hurts .
Now , everybody is talking about His Majesty , the Internet , and it is also a very useful skill , but don &apos;t rush to label things like Facebook Revolution , Twitter Revolution .
Don &apos;t mix tools with the substance .
It is true that the Internet and new media are very useful in making things faster and cheaper .
They make it also a bit safer for the participants because they give the part of anonymity .
We are watching the great example of something else the Internet can do .
It can put the price tag of state-sponsored violence over nonviolent protesters .
This is a famous group , We are all Khaled Said , made by Wael Ghonim in Egypt and his friend .
This is the mutilated face of the guy who was beaten by the police .
This is how he became the public , and this is what probably became the straw which broke the camel &apos;s back .
But here is also the bad news .
The nonviolent struggle is won in the real world , in the streets . You will never change your society towards democracy or economics if you sit down and click .
There are risks to be taken and there are living people who are winning the struggle .
Well , million dollar question : What will happen in the Arab World ?
And though young people from the Arab World were pretty successful in bringing down three dictators , shaking the region , kind of persuading clever kings from Jordan and Morocco doing substantial reforms , it is yet to be seen what will be the outcome , whether the Egyptians and Tunisians will make it through the transition or this will end in bloody ethnic and religious conflict , whether the Syrians will maintain nonviolent discipline , faced with the brutal daily violence which kills thousands already , or they will slip into violent struggle and make ugly civil war .
Will these revolutions be whole like through the transitions to democracy or be overtaken by military or extremists of all kinds ? We cannot tell .
Same works for the Western sector , where you can see all of these excited young people protesting around the world , occupying this , occupying that .
Are they going to become the world wave ?
Are they going to find their skills , their enthusiasm , and their strategy to find what they really want and push for the reform , or will they just stay complaining about the endless list of the things they hate ?
This is the difference between two towns .
Now , what &#91; do &#93; the statistics have ?
My friend &apos;s book , Maria Stephan &apos;s book , talks a lot about violent and nonviolent struggle , and there are some shocking data .
If you look at the last 35 years and different social transitions from dictatorship to democracy , you will see that out of 67 different cases , in 50 of these cases it was nonviolent struggle which was the key power .
This is one more reason to look at this phenomenon .
This is one more reason to look at the Generation Epsilon , enough for me to give them credit and hope that they will find their skills and their courage to use the nonviolent struggle and thus fix at least a part of the mess our generation is making in this world .
Thank you .
Gordon Brown : Wiring a web for global good
We &apos;re at a unique moment in history , says UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown : we can use today &apos;s interconnectedness to develop our shared global ethic -- and work together to confront the challenges of poverty , security , climate change and the economy .
Can I say how delighted I am to be away from the calm of Westminster and Whitehall ?
This is Kim , a nine-year-old Vietnam girl , her back ruined by napalm , and she awakened the conscience of the nation of America to begin to end the Vietnam War .
This is Birhan , who was the Ethiopian girl who launched Live Aid in the 1980s , 15 minutes away from death when she was rescued , and that picture of her being rescued is one that went round the world .
This is Tiananmen Square .
A man before a tank became a picture that became a symbol for the whole world of resistance .
This next is the Sudanese girl , a few moments from death , a vulture hovering in the background , a picture that went round the world and shocked people into action on poverty .
This is Neda , the Iranian girl who was shot while at a demonstration with her father in Iran only a few weeks ago , and she is now the focus , rightly so , of the YouTube generation .
And what do all these pictures and events have in common ?
What they have in common is what we see unlocks what we cannot see .
What we see unlocks the invisible ties and bonds of sympathy that bring us together to become a human community .
What these pictures demonstrate is that we do feel the pain of others , however distantly .
What I think these pictures demonstrate is that we do believe in something bigger than ourselves .
What these pictures demonstrate is that there is a moral sense across all religions , across all faiths , across all continents -- a moral sense that not only do we share the pain of others , and believe in something bigger than ourselves but we have a duty to act when we see things that are wrong that need righted , see injuries that need to be corrected , see problems that need to be rectified .
There is a story about Olof Palme , the Swedish Prime Minister , going to see Ronald Reagan in America in the 1980s .
Before he arrived Ronald Reagan said -- and he was the Swedish Social Democratic Prime Minister -- &quot; Isn &apos;t this man a communist ? &quot;
The reply was , &quot; No , Mr President , he &apos;s an anti-communist . &quot;
And Ronald Reagan said , &quot; I don &apos;t care what kind of communist he is ! &quot;
Ronald Reagan asked Olof Palme , the Social Democratic Prime Minister of Sweden , &quot; Well , what do you believe in ? Do you want to abolish the rich ? &quot;
He said , &quot; No , I want to abolish the poor . &quot;
Our responsibility is to let everyone have the chance to realize their potential to the full .
I believe there is a moral sense and a global ethic that commands attention from people of every religion and every faith , and people of no faith .
But I think what &apos;s new is that we now have the capacity to communicate instantaneously across frontiers right across the world .
We now have the capacity to find common ground with people who we will never meet , but who we will meet through the Internet and through all the modern means of communication ; that we now have the capacity to organize and take collective action together to deal with the problem or an injustice that we want to deal with ; and I believe that this makes this a unique age in human history , and it is the start of what I would call the creation of a truly global society .
Go back 200 years when the slave trade was under pressure from William Wilberforce and all the protesters .
They protested across Britain .
They won public opinion over a long period of time .
But it took 24 years for the campaign to be successful .
What could they have done with the pictures that they could have shown if they were able to use the modern means of communication to win people &apos;s hearts and minds ?
Or if you take Eglantyne Jebb , the woman who created Save the Children 90 years ago .
She was so appalled by what was happening in Austria as a result of the First World War and what was happening to children who were part of the defeated families of Austria , that in Britain she wanted to take action , but she had to go house to house , leaflet to leaflet , to get people to attend a rally in the Royal Albert Hall that eventually gave birth to Save the Children , an international organization that is now fully recognized as one of the great institutions in our land and in the world .
But what more could she have done if she &apos;d had the modern means of communications available to her to create a sense that the injustice that people saw had to be acted upon immediately ?
Now look at what &apos;s happened in the last 10 years .
In Philippines in 2001 , President Estrada -- a million people texted each other about the corruption of that regime , eventually brought it down and it was , of course , called the &quot; coup de text . &quot;
Then you have in Zimbabwe the first election under Robert Mugabe a year ago .
Because people were able to take mobile phone photographs of what was happening at the polling stations , it was impossible for that Premier to fix that election in the way that he wanted to do .
Or take Burma and the monks that were blogging out , a country that nobody knew anything about that was happening , until these blogs told the world that there was a repression , meaning that lives were being lost and people were being persecuted and Aung San Suu Kyi , who is one of the great prisoners of conscience of the world , had to be listened to .
Then take Iran itself , and what people are doing today : following what happened to Neda , people who are preventing the security services of Iran finding those people who are blogging out of Iran , any by everybody who is blogging , changing their address to Tehran , Iran , and making it difficult for the security services .
Take , therefore , what modern technology is capable of : the power of our moral sense allied to the power of communications and our ability to organize internationally .
That , in my view , gives us the first opportunity as a community to fundamentally change the world .
Foreign policy can never be the same again . It cannot be run by elites ; it &apos;s got to be run by listening to the public opinions of peoples who are blogging , who are communicating with each other around the world .
200 years ago the problem we had to solve was slavery .
150 years ago I suppose the main problem in a country like ours was how young people , children , had the right to education .
100 years ago in most countries in Europe , the pressure was for the right to vote .
50 years ago the pressure was for the right to social security and welfare .
In the last 50-60 years we have seen fascism , anti-Semitism , racism , apartheid , discrimination on the basis of sex and gender and sexuality ; all these have come under pressure because of the campaigns that have been run by people to change the world .
I was with Nelson Mandela a year ago , when he was in London .
I was at a concert that he was attending to mark his birthday and for the creation of new resources for his foundation .
I was sitting next to Nelson Mandela -- I was very privileged to do so -- when Amy Winehouse came onto the stage .
And Nelson Mandela was quite surprised at the appearance of the singer and I was explaining to him at the time who she was .
Amy Winehouse said , &quot; Nelson Mandela and I have a lot in common .
My husband too has spent a long time in prison . &quot;
Nelson Mandela then went down to the stage and he summarized the challenge for us all .
He said in his lifetime he had climbed a great mountain , the mountain of challenging and then defeating racial oppression and defeating apartheid .
He said that there was a greater challenge ahead , the challenge of poverty , of climate change -- global challenges that needed global solutions and needed the creation of a truly global society .
We are the first generation which is in a position to do this .
Combine the power of a global ethic with the power of our ability to communicate and organize globally , with the challenges that we now face , most of which are global in their nature .
Climate change cannot be solved in one country , but has got to be solved by the world working together .
A financial crisis , just as we have seen , could not be solved by America alone or Europe alone ; it needed the world to work together .
Take the problems of security and terrorism and , equally , the problem of human rights and development : they cannot be solved by Africa alone ; they cannot be solved by America or Europe alone .
We cannot solve these problems unless we work together .
So the great project of our generation , it seems to me , is to build for the first time , out of a global ethic and our global ability to communicate and organize together , a truly global society , built on that ethic but with institutions that can serve that global society and make for a different future .
We have now , and are the first generation with , the power to do this .
Take climate change . Is it not absolutely scandalous that we have a situation where we know that there is a climate change problem , where we know also that that will mean we have to give more resources to the poorest countries to deal with that , when we want to create a global carbon market , but there is no global institution that people have been able to agree upon to deal with this problem ?
One of the things that has got to come out of Copenhagen in the next few months is an agreement that there will be a global environmental institution that is able to deal with the problems of persuading the whole of the world to move along a climate-change agenda .
One of the reasons why an institution is not in itself enough is that we have got to persuade people around the world to change their behavior as well , so you need that global ethic of fairness and responsibility across the generations .
Take the financial crisis .
If people in poorer countries can be hit by a crisis that starts in New York or starts in the sub-prime market of the United States of America .
If people can find that that sub-prime product has been transferred across nations many , many times until it ends up in banks in Iceland or the rest in Britain , and people &apos;s ordinary savings are affected by it , then you cannot rely on a system of national supervision .
You need in the long run for stability , for economic growth , for jobs , as well as for financial stability , global economic institutions that make sure that growth to be sustained has to be shared , and are built on the principle that the prosperity of this world is indivisible .
So another challenge for our generation is to create global institutions that reflect our ideas of fairness and responsibility , not the ideas that were the basis of the last stage of financial development over these recent years .
Then take development and take the partnership we need between our countries and the rest of the world , the poorest part of the world .
We do not have the basis of a proper partnership for the future , and yet , out of people &apos;s desire for a global ethic and a global society that can be done .
I have just been talking to the President of Sierra Leone .
This is a country of six and a half million people , but it has only 80 doctors ; it has 200 nurses ; it has 120 midwives .
You cannot begin to build a healthcare system for six million people with such limited resources .
Or take the girl I met when I was in Tanzania , a girl called Miriam .
She was 11 years old ; her parents had both died from AIDS , her mother and then her father .
She was an AIDS orphan being handed across different extended families to be cared for .
She herself was suffering from HIV ; she was suffering from tuberculosis .
I met her in a field , she was ragged , she had no shoes .
When you looked in her eyes , any girl at the age of eleven is looking forward to the future , but there was an unreachable sadness in that girl &apos;s eyes and if I could have translated that to the rest of the world for that moment , I believe that all the work that it had done for the global HIV / AIDS fund would be rewarded by people being prepared to make donations .
We must then build a proper relationship between the richest and the poorest countries based on our desire that they are able to fend for themselves with the investment that is necessary in their agriculture , so that Africa is not a net importer of food , but an exporter of food .
Take the problems of human rights and the problems of security in so many countries around the world .
Burma is in chains , Zimbabwe is a human tragedy , in Sudan thousands of people have died unnecessarily for wars that we could prevent .
In the Rwanda Children &apos;s Museum , there is a photograph of a 10-year-old boy and the Children &apos;s Museum is commemorating the lives that were lost in the Rwandan genocide where a million people died .
There is a photograph of a boy called David .
Beside that photograph there is the information about his life .
It said &quot; David , age 10 . &quot;
David : ambition to be a doctor .
Favorite sport : football . What did he enjoy most ?
Making people laugh .
How did he die ?
Tortured to death .
Last words said to his mother who was also tortured to death : &quot; Don &apos;t worry . The United Nations are coming . &quot;
And we never did .
And that young boy believed our promises that we would help people in difficulty in Rwanda , and we never did .
So we have got to create in this world also institutions for peacekeeping and humanitarian aid , but also for reconstruction and security for some of the conflict-ridden states of the world .
So my argument today is basically this .
We have the means by which we could create a truly global society .
The institutions of this global society can be created by our endeavors .
That global ethic can infuse the fairness and responsibility that is necessary for these institutions to work , but we should not lose the chance in this generation , in this decade in particular , with President Obama in America , with other people working with us around the world , to create global institutions for the environment , and for finance , and for security and for development , that make sense of our responsibility to other peoples , our desire to bind the world together , and our need to tackle problems that everybody knows exist .
It is said that in Ancient Rome that when Cicero spoke to his audiences , people used to turn to each other and say about Cicero , &quot; Great speech . &quot;
But it is said that in Ancient Greece when Demosthenes spoke to his audiences , people turned to each other and didn &apos;t say &quot; Great speech . &quot;
They said , &quot; Let &apos;s march . &quot;
We should be marching towards a global society .
Thank you .
Oliver Sacks : What hallucination reveals about our minds
Neurologist and author Oliver Sacks brings our attention to Charles Bonnet syndrome -- when visually impaired people experience lucid hallucinations . He describes the experiences of his patients in heartwarming detail and walks us through the biology of this under-reported phenomenon .
We see with the eyes , but we see with the brain as well .
And seeing with the brain is often called imagination .
And we are familiar with the landscapes of our own imagination , our inscapes . We &apos;ve lived with them all our lives .
But there are also hallucinations as well , and hallucinations are completely different .
They don &apos;t seem to be of our creation .
They don &apos;t seem to be under our control .
They seem to come from the outside , and to mimic perception .
So I am going to be talking about hallucinations , and a particular sort of visual hallucination which I see among my patients .
A few months ago , I got a phone call from a nursing home where I work .
They told me that one of their residents , an old lady in her 90s , was seeing things , and they wondered if she &apos;d gone bonkers or , because she was an old lady , whether she &apos;d had a stroke , or whether she had Alzheimer &apos;s .
And so they asked me if I would come and see Rosalie , the old lady .
I went in to see her .
It was evident straight away that she was perfectly sane and lucid and of good intelligence , but she &apos;d been very startled and very bewildered , because she &apos;d been seeing things .
And she told me -- the nurses hadn &apos;t mentioned this -- that she was blind , that she had been completely blind from macular degeneration for five years .
But now , for the last few days , she &apos;d been seeing things .
So I said , &quot; What sort of things ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; People in Eastern dress , in drapes , walking up and down stairs .
A man who turns towards me and smiles .
But he has huge teeth on one side of his mouth .
Animals too .
I see a white building . It &apos;s snowing , a soft snow .
I see this horse with a harness , dragging the snow away .
Then , one night , the scene changes .
I see cats and dogs walking towards me .
They come to a certain point and then stop .
Then it changes again .
I see a lot of children . They are walking up and down stairs .
They wear bright colors , rose and blue , like Eastern dress . &quot;
Sometimes , she said , before the people come on , she may hallucinate pink and blue squares on the floor , which seem to go up to the ceiling .
I said , &quot; Is this like a dream ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; No , it &apos;s not like a dream . It &apos;s like a movie . &quot;
She said , &quot; It &apos;s got color . It &apos;s got motion .
But it &apos;s completely silent , like a silent movie . &quot;
And she said that it &apos;s a rather boring movie .
She said , &quot; All these people with Eastern dress , walking up and down , very repetitive , very limited . &quot;
And she has a sense of humor .
She knew it was a hallucination .
But she was frightened . She &apos;d lived 95 years and she &apos;d never had a hallucination before .
She said that the hallucinations were unrelated to anything she was thinking or feeling or doing , that they seemed to come on by themselves , or disappear .
She had no control over them .
She said she didn &apos;t recognize any of the people or places in the hallucinations .
And none of the people or the animals , well , they all seemed oblivious of her .
And she didn &apos;t know what was going on .
She wondered if she was going mad or losing her mind .
Well , I examined her carefully .
She was a bright old lady , perfectly sane . She had no medical problems .
She wasn &apos;t on any medications which could produce hallucinations .
But she was blind .
And I then said to her , &quot; I think I know what you have . &quot;
I said , &quot; There is a special form of visual hallucination which may go with deteriorating vision or blindness .
This was originally described , &quot; I said , &quot; right back in the 18th century , by a man called Charles Bonnet .
And you have Charles Bonnet syndrome .
There is nothing wrong with your brain . There is nothing wrong with your mind .
You have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
And she was very relieved at this , that there was nothing seriously the matter , and also rather curious .
She said , &quot; Who is this Charles Bonnet ? &quot;
She said , &quot; Did he have them himself ? &quot;
And she said , &quot; Tell all the nurses that I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not crazy . I &apos;m not demented . I have Charles Bonnet syndrome . &quot;
Well , so I did tell the nurses .
Now this , for me , is a common situation .
I work in old-age homes , largely .
I see a lot of elderly people who are hearing impaired or visually impaired .
About 10 percent of the hearing impaired people get musical hallucinations .
And about 10 percent of the visually impaired people get visual hallucinations .
You don &apos;t have to be completely blind , only sufficiently impaired .
Now with the original description in the 18th century , Charles Bonnet did not have them .
His grandfather had these hallucinations .
His grandfather was a magistrate , an elderly man .
He &apos;d had cataract surgery .
His vision was pretty poor .
And in 1759 , he described to his grandson various things he was seeing .
The first thing he said was he saw a handkerchief in midair .
It was a large blue handkerchief with four orange circles .
And he knew it was a hallucination .
You don &apos;t have handkerchiefs in midair .
And then he saw a big wheel in midair .
But sometimes he wasn &apos;t sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
So on one occasion , when his granddaughters were visiting them , he said , &quot; And who are these handsome young men with you ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; Alas , Grandpapa , there are no handsome young men . &quot;
And then the handsome young men disappeared .
It &apos;s typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .
They don &apos;t usually fade in and out .
They are rather sudden , and they change suddenly .
Charles Lullin , the grandfather , saw hundreds of different figures , different landscapes of all sorts .
On one occasion , he saw a man in a bathrobe smoking a pipe , and realized it was himself .
That was the only figure he recognized .
On one occasion when he was walking in the streets of Paris , he saw -- this was real -- a scaffolding .
But when he got back home , he saw a miniature of the scaffolding six inches high , on his study table .
This repetition of perception is sometimes called palinopsia .
With him and with Rosalie , what seems to be going on -- and Rosalie said , &quot; What &apos;s going on ? &quot; -- and I said that as you lose vision , as the visual parts of the brain are no longer getting any input , they become hyperactive and excitable , and they start to fire spontaneously .
And you start to see things .
The things you see can be very complicated indeed .
With another patient of mine , who , also had some vision , the vision she had could be disturbing .
On one occasion , she said she saw a man in a striped shirt in a restaurant .
And he turned around . And then he divided into six figures in striped shirts , who started walking towards her .
And then the six figures came together again , like a concertina .
Once , when she was driving , or rather , her husband was driving , the road divided into four and she felt herself going simultaneously up four roads .
She had very mobile hallucinations as well .
A lot of them had to do with a car .
Sometimes she would see a teenage boy sitting on the hood of the car .
He was very tenacious and he moved rather gracefully when the car turned .
And then when they came to a stop , the boy would do a sudden vertical takeoff , 100 foot in the air , and then disappear .
Another patient of mine had a different sort of hallucination .
This was a woman who didn &apos;t have trouble with her eyes , but the visual parts of her brain , a little tumor in the occipital cortex .
And , above all , she would see cartoons .
These cartoons would be transparent and would cover half the visual field , like a screen .
And especially she saw cartoons of Kermit the Frog .
Now , I don &apos;t watch Sesame Street , but she made a point of saying , &quot; Why Kermit ? &quot; She said , &quot; Kermit the Frog means nothing to me .
You know , I was wondering about Freudian determinants .
Why Kermit ?
Kermit the Frog means nothing to me . &quot;
She didn &apos;t mind the cartoons too much .
But what did disturb her was she got very persistent images or hallucinations of faces and as with Rosalie , the faces were often deformed , with very large teeth or very large eyes .
And these frightened her .
Well , what is going on with these people ?
As a physician , I have to try and define what &apos;s going on , and to reassure people , especially to reassure them that they &apos;re not going insane .
Something like 10 percent , as I said , of visually impaired people get these .
But no more than one percent of the people acknowledge them , because they are afraid they will be seen as insane or something .
And if they do mention them to their own doctors they may be misdiagnosed .
In particular , the notion is that if you see things or hear things , you &apos;re going mad , but the psychotic hallucinations are quite different .
Psychotic hallucinations , whether they are visual or vocal , they address you . They accuse you .
They seduce you . They humiliate you .
They jeer at you .
You interact with them .
There is none of this quality of being addressed with these Charles Bonnet hallucinations .
There is a film . You &apos;re seeing a film which has nothing to do with you , or that &apos;s how people think about it .
There is also a rare thing called temporal lobe epilepsy , and sometimes , if one has this , one may feel oneself transported back to a time and place in the past .
You &apos;re at a particular road junction .
You smell chestnuts roasting .
You hear the traffic . All the senses are involved .
And you &apos;re waiting for your girl .
And it &apos;s that Tuesday evening back in 1982 .
And the temporal lobe hallucinations are all-sense hallucinations , full of feeling , full of familiarity , located in space and time , coherent , dramatic .
The Charles Bonnet ones are quite different .
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces .
Faces , and sometimes deformed faces , are the single commonest thing in these hallucinations .
And one of the second commonest is cartoons .
So , what is going on ?
Fascinatingly , in the last few years , it &apos;s been possible to do functional brain imagery , to do fMRI on people as they are hallucinating .
And in fact , to find that different parts of the visual brain are activated as they are hallucinating .
When people have these simple geometrical hallucinations , the primary visual cortex is activated .
This is the part of the brain which perceives edges and patterns .
You don &apos;t form images with your primary visual cortex .
When images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe .
And in particular , one area of the temporal lobe is called the fusiform gyrus .
And it &apos;s known that if people have damage in the fusiform gyrus , they maybe lose the ability to recognize faces .
But if there is an abnormal activity in the fusiform gyrus , they may hallucinate faces , and this is exactly what you find in some of these people .
There is an area in the anterior part of this gyrus where teeth and eyes are represented , and that part of the gyrus is activated when people get the deformed hallucinations .
There is another part of the brain which is especially activated when one sees cartoons .
It &apos;s activated when one recognizes cartoons , when one draws cartoons , and when one hallucinates them .
It &apos;s very interesting that that should be specific .
There are other parts of the brain which are specifically involved with the recognition and hallucination of buildings and landscapes .
Around 1970 , it was found that there were not only parts of the brain , but particular cells .
&quot; Face cells &quot; were discovered around 1970 .
And now we know that there are hundreds of other sorts of cells , which can be very , very specific .
So you may not only have &quot; car &quot; cells , you may have &quot; Aston Martin &quot; cells .
I saw an Aston Martin this morning .
I had to bring it in .
And now it &apos;s in there somewhere .
Now , at this level , in what &apos;s called the inferotemporal cortex , there are only visual images , or figments or fragments .
It &apos;s only at higher levels that the other senses join in and there are connections with memory and emotion .
And in the Charles Bonnet syndrome , you don &apos;t go to those higher levels .
You &apos;re in these levels of inferior visual cortex where you have thousands and tens of thousands and millions of images , or figments , or fragmentary figments , all neurally encoded in particular cells or small clusters of cells .
Normally these are all part of the integrated stream of perception , or imagination , and one is not conscious of them .
It is only if one is visually impaired or blind that the process is interrupted .
And instead of getting normal perception , you &apos;re getting an anarchic , convulsive stimulation , or release , of all of these visual cells in the inferotemporal cortex .
So , suddenly you see a face . Suddenly you see a car .
Suddenly this , and suddenly that .
The mind does its best to organize and to give some sort of coherence to this , but not terribly successfully .
When these were first described , it was thought that they could be interpreted like dreams .
But in fact people say , &quot; I don &apos;t recognize the people . I can &apos;t form any associations . &quot;
&quot; Kermit means nothing to me . &quot;
You don &apos;t get anywhere thinking of them as dreams .
Well , I &apos;ve more or less said what I wanted .
I think I just want to recapitulate and say this is common .
Think of the number of blind people .
There must be hundreds of thousands of blind people who have these hallucinations , but are too scared to mention them .
So this sort of thing needs to be brought into notice , for patients , for doctors , for the public .
Finally , I think they are infinitely interesting and valuable , for giving one some insight as to how the brain works .
Charles Bonnet said , 250 years ago -- he wondered how , thinking these hallucinations , how , as he put it , the theater of the mind could be generated by the machinery of the brain .
Now , 250 years later , I think we &apos;re beginning to glimpse how this is done .
Thanks very much .
That was superb . Thank you so much .
You speak about these things with so much insight and empathy for your patients .
Have you yourself experienced any of the syndromes you write about ?
Oliver Sacks : I was afraid you &apos;d ask that .
Well , yeah , a lot of them .
And actually I &apos;m a little visually impaired myself .
I &apos;m blind in one eye , and not terribly good in the other .
And I see the geometrical hallucinations .
But they stop there .
And they don &apos;t disturb you ?
Because you understand what &apos;s doing it , it doesn &apos;t make you worried ?
OS : Well they don &apos;t disturb me any more than my tinnitus , which I ignore .
They occasionally interest me , and I have many pictures of them in my notebooks .
I &apos;ve gone and had an fMRI myself , to see how my visual cortex is taking over .
And when I see all these hexagons and complex things , which I also have , in visual migraine , I wonder whether everyone sees things like this , and whether things like cave art or ornamental art may have been derived from them a bit .
That was an utterly , utterly fascinating talk .
Thank you so much for sharing .
OS : Thank you . Thank you .
Bart Weetjens : How I taught rats to sniff out land mines
No one knows exactly how many landmines still litter the world , but it &apos;s safe to safe : millions , waiting to kill and maim unsuspecting civilians . Clearing them is slow , expensive and dangerous . The founder of Apopo . Bart Weetjens , talks about his extraordinary project : training rats to sniff out land mines . He shows clips of his &quot; hero rats &quot; in action , and previews his work &apos;s next phase : teaching them to turn up tuberculosis in the lab .
I &apos;m here today to share with you an extraordinary journey -- extraordinarily rewarding journey , actually -- which brought me into training rats to save human lives by detecting landmines and tuberculosis .
As a child , I had two passions .
One was a passion for rodents .
I had all kinds of rats , mice , hamsters , gerbils , squirrels .
You name it , I bred it , and I sold them to pet shops .
I also had a passion for Africa .
Growing up in a multicultural environment , we had African students in the house , and I learned about their stories , so different backgrounds , dependency on imported know-how , goods , services , exuberant cultural diversity .
Africa was truly fascinating for me .
I became an industrial engineer , engineer in product development , and I focused on appropriate detection technologies , actually the first appropriate technologies for developing countries .
I started working in the industry , but I wasn &apos;t really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear , extracting and manufacturing mode .
I quit my job to focus on the real world problem : landmines .
We &apos;re talking &apos; 95 now .
Princess Diana is announcing on TV that landmines form a structural barrier to any development , which is really true .
As long as these devices are there , or there is suspicion of landmines , you can &apos;t really enter into the land .
Actually , there was an appeal worldwide for new detectors sustainable in the environments where they &apos;re needed to produce , which is mainly in the developing world .
We chose rats .
Why would you choose rats ?
Because , aren &apos;t they vermin ?
Well , actually rats are , in contrary to what most people think about them , rats are highly sociable creatures .
And actually , our product -- what you see here .
There &apos;s a target somewhere here .
You see an operator , a trained African with his rats in front who actually are left and right .
There , the animal finds a mine .
It scratches on the soil .
And the animal comes back for a food reward .
Very , very simple .
Very sustainable in this environment .
Here , the animal gets its food reward .
And that &apos;s how it works .
Very , very simple .
Now why would you use rats ?
Rats have been used since the &apos; 50s last century , in all kinds of experiments .
Rats have more genetic material allocated to olfaction than any other mammal species .
They &apos;re extremely sensitive to smell .
Moreover , they have the mechanisms to map all these smells and to communicate about it .
Now how do we communicate with rats ?
Well don &apos;t talk rat , but we have a clicker , a standard method for animal training , which you see there .
A clicker , which makes a particular sound with which you can reinforce particular behaviors .
First of all , we associate the click sound with a food reward , which is smashed banana and peanuts together in a syringe .
Once the animal knows click , food , click , food , click , food -- so click is food -- we bring it in a cage with a hole , and actually the animal learns to stick the nose in the hole under which a target scent is placed , and to do that for five seconds -- five seconds , which is long for a rat .
Once the animal knows this , we make the task a bit more difficult .
It learns how to find the target smell in a cage with several holes , up to 10 holes .
Then the animal learns to walk on a leash in the open and find targets .
In the next step , animals learn to find real mines in real minefields .
They are tested and accredited according to International Mine Action Standards , just like dogs have to pass a test .
This consists of 400 square meters .
There &apos;s a number of mines placed blindly , and the team of trainer and their rat have to find all the targets .
If the animal does that , it gets a license as an accredited animal to be operational in the field -- just like dogs , by the way .
Maybe one slight difference : we can train rats at a fifth of the price of training the mining dog .
This is our team in Mozambique : one Tanzanian trainer , who transfers the skills to these three Mozambican fellows .
And you should see the pride in the eyes of these people .
They have a skill , which makes them much less dependent on foreign aid .
Moreover , this small team together with , of course , you need the heavy vehicles and the manual de-miners to follow-up .
But with this small investment in a rat capacity , we have demonstrated in Mozambique that we can reduce the cost-price per square meter up to 60 percent of what is currently normal -- two dollars per square meter , we do it at $ 1.18 , and we can still bring that price down .
Question of scale .
If you can bring in more rats , we can actually make the output even bigger .
We have a demonstration site in Mozambique .
Eleven African governments have seen that they can become less dependent by using this technology .
They have signed the pact for peace and treaty in the Great Lakes region , and they endorse hero rats to clear their common borders of landmines .
But let me bring you to a very different problem .
And there &apos;s about 6,000 people last year that walked on a landmine , but worldwide last year , almost 1.9 million died from tuberculosis as a first cause of infection .
Especially in Africa where T.B. and HIV are strongly linked , there is a huge common problem .
Microscopy , the standard WHO procedure , reaches from 40 to 60 percent reliability .
In Tanzania -- the numbers don &apos;t lie -- 45 percent of people -- T.B. patients -- get diagnosed with T.B. before they die .
It means that , if you have T.B. , you have more chance that you won &apos;t be detected , but will just die from T.B. secondary infections and so on .
And if , however , you are detected very early , diagnosed early , treatment can start , and even in HIV-positives , it makes sense .
You can actually cure T.B. , even in HIV-positives .
So in our common language , Dutch , the name for T.B.
is &quot; tering , &quot; which , etymologically , refers to the smell of tar .
Already the old Chinese and the Greek , Hippocrates , have actually published , documented , that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients .
So what we did is we collected some samples -- just as a way of testing -- from hospitals , trained rats on them and see if this works , and wonder , well , we can reach 89 percent sensitivity , 86 percent specificity using multiple rats in a row .
This is how it works , and really , this is a generic technology .
We &apos;re talking now explosives , tuberculosis , but can you imagine , you can actually put anything under there .
So how does it work ?
You have a cassette with 10 samples .
You put these 10 samples at once in the cage .
An animal only needs two hundredths of a second to discriminate the scent , so it goes extremely fast .
Here it &apos;s already at the third sample .
This is a positive sample .
It gets a click sound and comes for the food reward .
And by doing so , very fast , we can have like a second-line opinion to see which patients are positive , which are negative .
Just as an indication , whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day , a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .
A cage like this -- A cage like this -- provided that you have rats , and we have now currently 25 tuberculosis rats -- a cage like this , operating throughout the day , can process 1,680 samples .
Can you imagine the potential offspring applications -- environmental detection of pollutants in soils , customs applications , detection of illicit goods in containers and so on .
But let &apos;s stick first to tuberculosis .
I just want to briefly highlight , the blue rods are the scores of microscopy only at the five clinics in Dar es Salaam on a population of 500,000 people , where 15,000 reported to get a test done .
Microscopy for 1,800 patients .
And by just presenting the samples once more to the rats and looping those results back , we were able to increase case detection rates by over 30 percent .
Throughout last year , we &apos;ve been -- depending on which intervals you take -- we &apos;ve been consistently increasing case detection rates in five hospitals in Dar es Salaam between 30 and 40 percent .
So this is really considerable .
Knowing that a missed patient by microscopy infects up to 15 people , healthy people , per year , you can be sure that we have saved lots of lives .
At least our hero rats have saved lots of lives .
The way forward for us is now to standardize this technology .
And there are simple things like , for instance , we have a small laser in the sniffer hole where the animal has to stick for five seconds .
So , to standardize this .
Also , to standardize the pellets , the food rewards , and to semi-automate this in order to replicate this on a much larger scale and affect the lives of many more people .
To conclude , there are also other applications at the horizon .
Here is a first prototype of our camera rat , which is a rat with a rat backpack with a camera that can go under rubble to detect for victims after earthquake and so on .
This is in a prototype stage .
We don &apos;t have a working system here yet .
To conclude , I would actually like to say , you may think this is about rats , these projects , but in the end it is about people .
It is about empowering vulnerable communities to tackle difficult , expensive and dangerous humanitarian detection tasks , and doing that with a local resource , plenty available .
So something completely different is to keep on challenging your perception about the resources surrounding you , whether they are environmental , technological , animal , or human .
And to respectfully harmonize with them in order to foster a sustainable work .
Thank you very much .
Amy Tan : Where does creativity hide ?
Novelist Amy Tan digs deep into the creative process , looking for hints of how hers evolved .
The Value of Nothing : Out of Nothing Comes Something .
That was an essay I wrote when I was 11 years old and I got a B + .
What I &apos;m going to talk about : nothing out of something , and how we create .
And I &apos;m gonna try and do that within the 18-minute time span that we were told to stay within , and to follow the TED commandments : that is , actually , something that creates a near-death experience , but near-death is good for creativity .
OK .
So , I also want to explain , because Dave Eggers said he was going to heckle me if I said anything that was a lie , or not true to universal creativity .
And I &apos;ve done it this way for half the audience , who is scientific .
When I say we , I don &apos;t mean you , necessarily ; I mean me , and my right brain , my left brain and the one that &apos;s in between that is the censor and tells me what I &apos;m saying is wrong .
And I &apos;m going do that also by looking at what I think is part of my creative process , which includes a number of things that happened , actually -- the nothing started even earlier than the moment in which I &apos;m creating something new .
And that includes nature , and nurture , and what I refer to as nightmares .
Now in the nature area , we look at whether or not we are innately equipped with something , perhaps in our brains , some abnormal chromosome that causes this muse-like effect .
And some people would say that we &apos;re born with it in some other means .
And others , like my mother , would say that I get my material from past lives .
Some people would also say that creativity may be a function of some other neurological quirk -- van Gogh syndrome -- that you have a little bit of , you know , psychosis , or depression .
I do have to say , somebody -- I read recently that van Gogh wasn &apos;t really necessarily psychotic , that he might have had temporal lobe seizures , and that might have caused his spurt of creativity , and I don &apos;t -- I suppose it does something in some part of your brain .
And I will mention that I actually developed temporal lobe seizures a number of years ago , but it was during the time I was writing my last book , and some people say that book is quite different .
I think that part of it also begins with a sense of identity crisis : you know , who am I , why am I this particular person , why am I not black like everybody else ?
And sometimes you &apos;re equipped with skills , but they may not be the kind of skills that enable creativity .
I used to draw . I thought I would be an artist .
And I had a miniature poodle .
And it wasn &apos;t bad , but it wasn &apos;t really creative .
Because all I could really do was represent in a very one-on-one way .
And I have a sense that I probably copied this from a book .
And then , I also wasn &apos;t really shining in a certain area that I wanted to be , and you know , you look at those scores , and it wasn &apos;t bad , but it was not certainly predictive that I would one day make my living out of the artful arrangement of words .
Also , one of the principles of creativity is to have a little childhood trauma .
And I had the usual kind that I think a lot of people had , and that is that , you know , I had expectations placed on me .
That figure right there , by the way , figure right there was a toy given to me when I was but nine years old , and it was to help me become a doctor from a very early age .
I have some ones that were long lasting : from the age of five to 15 , this was supposed to be my side occupation , and it led to a sense of failure .
But actually , there was something quite real in my life that happened when I was about 14 .
And it was discovered that my brother , in 1967 , and then my father , six months later , had brain tumors .
And my mother believed that something had gone wrong , and she was gonna find out what it was , and she was gonna fix it .
My father was a Baptist minister , and he believed in miracles , and that God &apos;s will would take care of that .
But , of course , they ended up dying , six months apart .
And after that , my mother believed that it was fate , or curses -- she went looking through all the reasons in the universe why this would have happened .
Everything except randomness . She did not believe in randomness .
There was a reason for everything .
And one of the reasons , she thought , was that her mother , who had died when she was very young , was angry at her .
And so , I had this notion of death all around me , because my mother also believed that I would be next , and she would be next .
And when you are faced with the prospect of death very soon , you begin to think very much about everything .
You become very creative , in a survival sense .
And this , then , led to my big questions .
And they &apos;re the same ones that I have today .
And they are : why do things happen , and how do things happen ?
And the one my mother asked : how do I make things happen ?
It &apos;s a wonderful way to look at these questions , when you write a story .
Because , after all , in that framework , between page one and 300 , you have to answer this question of why things happen , how things happen , in what order they happen . What are the influences ?
How do I , as the narrator , as the writer , also influence that ?
And it &apos;s also one that , I think , many of our scientists have been asking .
It &apos;s a kind of cosmology , and I have to develop a cosmology of my own universe , as the creator of that universe .
And you see , there &apos;s a lot of back and forth in trying to make that happen , trying to figure it out -- years and years , oftentimes .
So , when I look at creativity , I also think that it is this sense or this inability to repress , my looking at associations in practically anything in life .
And I got a lot of them during what &apos;s been going on throughout this conference , almost everything that &apos;s been going on .
And so I &apos;m going to use , as the metaphor , this association : quantum mechanics , which I really don &apos;t understand , but I &apos;m still gonna use it as the process for explaining how it is the metaphor .
So , in quantum mechanics , of course , you have dark energy and dark matter .
And it &apos;s the same thing in looking at these questions of how things happen .
There &apos;s a lot of unknown , and you often don &apos;t know what it is except by its absence .
But when you make those associations , you want them to come together in a kind of synergy in the story , and what you &apos;re finding is what matters . The meaning .
And that &apos;s what I look for in my work , a personal meaning .
There is also the uncertainty principle , which is part of quantum mechanics , as I understand it .
And this happens constantly in the writing .
And there &apos;s the terrible and dreaded observer effect , in which you &apos;re looking for something , and you know , things are happening simultaneously , and you &apos;re looking at it in a different way , and you &apos;re trying to really look for the about-ness , or what is this story about . And if you try too hard , then you will only write the about .
You won &apos;t discover anything .
And what you were supposed to find , what you hoped to find in some serendipitous way , is no longer there .
Now , I don &apos;t want to ignore the other side of what happens in our universe , like many of our scientists have .
And so , I am going to just throw in string theory here , and just say that creative people are multidimensional , and there are 11 levels , I think , of anxiety .
And they all operate at the same time .
There is also a big question of ambiguity .
And I would link that to something called the cosmological constant .
And you don &apos;t know what is operating , but something is operating there .
And ambiguity , to me , is very uncomfortable in my life , and I have it . Moral ambiguity .
It is constantly there . And , just as an example , this is one that recently came to me .
It was something I read in an editorial by a woman who was talking about the war in Iraq . And she said , &quot; Save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
A very famous Chinese saying , she said .
And that means because we went into Iraq , we should stay there until things were solved . You know , maybe even 100 years .
So , there was another one that I came across , and it &apos;s &quot; saving fish from drowning . &quot;
And it &apos;s what Buddhist fishermen say , because they &apos;re not supposed to kill anything .
And they also have to make a living , and people need to be fed .
So their way of rationalizing that is they are saving the fish from drowning , and unfortunately , in the process the fish die .
Now , what &apos;s encapsulated in both these drowning metaphors -- actually , one of them is my mother &apos;s interpretation , and it is a famous Chinese saying , because she said it to me : &quot; save a man from drowning , you are responsible to him for life . &quot;
And it was a warning -- don &apos;t get involved in other people &apos;s business , or you &apos;re going to get stuck .
OK . I think if somebody really was drowning , she &apos;d save them .
But , both of these sayings -- saving a fish from drowning , or saving a man from drowning -- to me they had to do with intentions .
And all of us in life , when we see a situation , we have a response .
And then we have intentions .
There &apos;s an ambiguity of what that should be that we should do , and then we do something .
And the results of that may not match what our intentions had been .
Maybe things go wrong . And so , after that , what are our responsibilities ?
What are we supposed to do ?
Do we stay in for life , or do we do something else and justify and say , well , my intentions were good , and therefore I cannot be held responsible for all of it ?
That is the ambiguity in my life that really disturbed me , and led me to write a book called &quot; Saving Fish From Drowning . &quot;
I saw examples of that . Once I identified this question , it was all over the place .
I got these hints everywhere .
And then , in a way , I knew that they had always been there .
And then writing , that &apos;s what happens . I get these hints , these clues , and I realize that they &apos;ve been obvious , and yet they have not been .
And what I need , in effect , is a focus .
And when I have the question , it is a focus .
And all these things that seem to be flotsam and jetsam in life actually go through that question , and what happens is those particular things become relevant .
And it seems like it &apos;s happening all the time .
You think there &apos;s a sort of coincidence going on , a serendipity , in which you &apos;re getting all this help from the universe .
And it may also be explained that now you have a focus .
And you are noticing it more often .
But you apply this .
You begin to look at things having to do with your tensions .
Your brother , who &apos;s fallen in trouble , do you take care of him ?
Why or why not ?
It may be something that is perhaps more serious -- as I said , human rights in Burma .
I was thinking that I shouldn &apos;t go because somebody said , if I did , it would show that I approved of the military regime there .
And then , after a while , I had to ask myself , &quot; Why do we take on knowledge , why do we take on assumptions that other people have given us ? &quot;
And it was the same thing that I felt when I was growing up , and was hearing these rules of moral conduct from my father , who was a Baptist minister .
So I decided that I would go to Burma for my own intentions , and still didn &apos;t know that if I went there , what the result of that would be , if I wrote a book -- and I just would have to face that later , when the time came .
We are all concerned with things that we see in the world that we are aware of .
We come to this point and say , what do I as an individual do ?
Not all of us can go to Africa , or work at hospitals , so what do we do , if we have this moral response , this feeling ?
Also , I think one of the biggest things we are all looking at , and we talked about today , is genocide .
This leads to this question .
When I look at all these things that are morally ambiguous and uncomfortable , and I consider what my intentions should be , I realize it goes back to this identity question that I had when I was a child -- and why am I here , and what is the meaning of my life , and what is my place in the universe ?
It seems so obvious , and yet it is not .
We all hate moral ambiguity in some sense , and yet it is also absolutely necessary .
In writing a story , it is the place where I begin .
Sometimes I get help from the universe , it seems .
My mother would say it was the ghost of my grandmother from the very first book , because it seemed I knew things I was not supposed to know .
Instead of writing that the grandmother died accidentally , from an overdose of opium , while having too much of a good time , I actually put down in the story that the woman killed herself , and that actually was the way it happened .
And my mother decided that that information must have come from my grandmother .
There are also things , quite uncanny , which bring me information that will help me in the writing of the book .
In this case , I was writing a story that included some kind of detail , period of history , a certain location .
And I needed to find something historically that would match that .
And I took down this book , and I -- first page that I flipped it to was exactly the setting , and the time period , and the kind of character I needed -- was the Taiping rebellion , happening in the area near Guilin , outside of that , and a character who thought he was the son of God .
You wonder , are these things random chance ?
Well , what is random ? What is chance ? What is luck ?
What are things that you get from the universe that you can &apos;t really explain ?
And that goes into the story , too .
These are the things I constantly think about from day to day .
Especially when good things happen , and , in particular , when bad things happen .
But I do think there &apos;s a kind of serendipity , and I do want to know what those elements are , so I can thank them , and also try to find them in my life .
Because , again , I think that when I am aware of them , more of them happen .
Another chance encounter is when I went to a place -- I just was with some friends , and we drove randomly to a different place , and we ended up in this non-tourist location , a beautiful village , pristine .
And we walked three valleys beyond , and the third valley , there was something quite mysterious and ominous , a discomfort I felt . And then I knew that had to be &#91; the &#93; setting of my book .
And in writing one of the scenes , it happened in that third valley .
For some reason I wrote about cairns -- stacks of rocks -- that a man was building .
And I didn &apos;t know exactly why I had it , but it was so vivid .
I got stuck , and a friend , when she asked if I would go for a walk with her dogs , that I said , sure . And about 45 minutes later , walking along the beach , I came across this .
And it was a man , a Chinese man , and he was stacking these things , not with glue , not with anything .
And I asked him , &quot; How is it possible to do this ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , I guess with everything in life , there &apos;s a place of balance . &quot;
And this was exactly the meaning of my story at that point .
I had so many examples -- I have so many instances like this , when I &apos;m writing a story , and I cannot explain it .
Is it because I had the filter that I have such a strong coincidence in writing about these things ?
Or is it a kind of serendipity that we cannot explain , like the cosmological constant ?
A big thing that I also think about is accidents .
And as I said , my mother did not believe in randomness .
What is the nature of accidents ?
And how are we going to assign what the responsibility and the causes are , outside of a court of law ?
I was able to see that in a firsthand way , when I went to beautiful Dong village , in Guizhou , the poorest province of China .
And I saw this beautiful place . I knew I wanted to come back .
And I had a chance to do that , when National Geographic asked me And I said yes , about this village of singing people , singing minority .
And they agreed , and between the time I saw this place and the next time I went , there was a terrible accident . A man , an old man , fell asleep , and his quilt dropped in a pan of fire that kept him warm .
60 homes were destroyed , and 40 were damaged .
Responsibility was assigned to the family .
The man &apos;s sons were banished to live three kilometers away , in a cowshed .
And , of course , as Westerners , we say , &quot; Well , it was an accident . That &apos;s not fair .
It &apos;s the son , not the father . &quot;
When I go on a story , I have to let go of those kinds of beliefs .
It takes a while , but I have to let go of them and just go there , and be there .
And so I was there on three occasions , different seasons .
And I began to sense something different about the history , and what had happened before , and the nature of life in a very poor village , and what you find as your joys , and your rituals , your traditions , your links with other families . And I saw how this had a kind of justice , in its responsibility .
I was able to find out also about the ceremony that they were using , a ceremony they hadn &apos;t used in about 29 years . And it was to send some men -- a Feng Shui master sent men down to the underworld on ghost horses .
Now you , as Westerners , and I , as Westerners , would say well , that &apos;s superstition . But after being there for a while , and seeing the amazing things that happened , you begin to wonder whose beliefs are those that are in operation in the world , determining how things happen .
So I remained with them , and the more I wrote that story , the more I got into those beliefs , and I think that &apos;s important for me -- to take on the beliefs , because that is where the story is real , and that is where I &apos;m gonna find the answers to how I feel about certain questions that I have in life .
Years go by , of course , and the writing , it doesn &apos;t happen instantly , as I &apos;m trying to convey it to you here at TED .
The book comes and it goes . When it arrives , it is no longer my book .
It is in the hands of readers , and they interpret it differently .
But I go back to this question of , how do I create something out of nothing ?
And how do I create my own life ?
And I think it is by questioning , and saying to myself that there are no absolute truths .
I believe in specifics , the specifics of story , and the past , the specifics of that past , and what is happening in the story at that point .
I also believe that in thinking about things -- my thinking about luck , and fate , and coincidences and accidents , God &apos;s will , and the synchrony of mysterious forces -- I will come to some notion of what that is , how we create .
I have to think of my role . Where I am in the universe , and did somebody intend for me to be that way , or is it just something I came up with ?
And I also can find that by imagining fully , and becoming what is imagined -- and yet is in that real world , the fictional world .
And that is how I find particles of truth , not the absolute truth , or the whole truth .
And they have to be in all possibilities , including those I never considered before .
So , there are never complete answers .
Or rather , if there is an answer , it is to remind myself that there is uncertainty in everything , and that is good , because then I will discover something new .
And if there is a partial answer , a more complete answer from me , it is to simply imagine .
And to imagine is to put myself in that story , until there was only -- there is a transparency between me and the story that I am creating .
And that &apos;s how I &apos;ve discovered that if I feel what is in the story -- in one story -- then I come the closest , I think , to knowing what compassion is , to feeling that compassion .
Because for everything , in that question of how things happen , it has to do with the feeling .
I have to become the story in order to understand a lot of that .
We &apos;ve come to the end of the talk , and I will reveal what is in the bag , and it is the muse , and it is the things that transform in our lives , that are wonderful and stay with us .
There she is .
Thank you very much !
Andrew Fitzgerald : Adventures in Twitter fiction
In the 1930s , broadcast radio introduced an entirely new form of storytelling ; today , micro-blogging platforms like Twitter are changing the scene again . Andrew Fitzgerald takes a look at the short but fascinating history of new forms of creative experimentation in fiction and storytelling .
So in my free time outside of Twitter I experiment a little bit with telling stories online , experimenting with what we can do with new digital tools .
And in my job at Twitter , I actually spent a little bit of time working with authors and storytellers as well , helping to expand out the bounds of what people are experimenting with .
And I want to talk through some examples today of things that people have done that I think are really fascinating using flexible identity and anonymity on the web and blurring the lines between fact and fiction .
But I want to start and go back to the 1930s .
Long before a little thing called Twitter , radio brought us broadcasts and connected millions of people to single points of broadcast .
And from those single points emanated stories .
Some of them were familiar stories .
Some of them were new stories .
And for a while they were familiar formats , but then radio began to evolve its own unique formats specific to that medium .
Think about episodes that happened live on radio .
Combining the live play and the serialization of written fiction , you get this new format .
And the reason why I bring up radio is that I think radio is a great example of how a new medium defines new formats which then define new stories .
And of course , today , we have an entirely new medium to play with , which is this online world .
This is the map of verified users on Twitter and the connections between them .
There are thousands upon thousands of them .
Every single one of these points is its own broadcaster .
We &apos;ve gone to this world of many to many , where access to the tools is the only barrier to broadcasting .
And I think that we should start to see wildly new formats emerge as people learn how to tell stories in this new medium .
I actually believe that we are in a wide open frontier for creative experimentation , if you will , that we &apos;ve explored and begun to settle this wild land of the Internet and are now just getting ready to start to build structures on it , and those structures are the new formats of storytelling that the Internet will allow us to create .
I believe this starts with an evolution of existing methods .
The short story , for example , people are saying that the short story is experiencing a renaissance of sorts thanks to e-readers , digital marketplaces .
One writer , Hugh Howey , experimented with short stories on Amazon by releasing one very short story called &quot; Wool . &quot;
And he actually says that he didn &apos;t intend for &quot; Wool &quot; to become a series , but that the audience loved the first story so much they demanded more , and so he gave them more .
He gave them &quot; Wool 2 , &quot; which was a little bit longer than the first one , &quot; Wool 3 , &quot; which was even longer , culminating in &quot; Wool 5 , &quot; which was a 60,000-word novel .
I think Howey was able to do all of this because he had the quick feedback system of e-books .
He was able to write and publish in relatively short order .
There was no mediator between him and the audience .
It was just him directly connected with his audience and building on the feedback and enthusiasm that they were giving him .
So this whole project was an experiment .
It started with the one short story , and I think the experimentation actually became a part of Howey &apos;s format .
And that &apos;s something that this medium enabled , was experimentation being a part of the format itself .
This is a short story by the author Jennifer Egan called &quot; Black Box . &quot;
It was originally written specifically with Twitter in mind .
Egan convinced The New Yorker to start a New Yorker fiction account from which they could tweet all of these lines that she created .
Now Twitter , of course , has a 140-character limit .
Egan mocked that up just writing manually in this storyboard sketchbook , used the physical space constraints of those storyboard squares to write each individual tweet , and those tweets ended up becoming over 600 of them that were serialized by The New Yorker .
Every night , at 8 p.m. , you could tune in to a short story from The New Yorker &apos;s fiction account .
I think that &apos;s pretty exciting : tune-in literary fiction .
The experience of Egan &apos;s story , of course , like anything on Twitter , there were multiple ways to experience it .
You could scroll back through it , but interestingly , if you were watching it live , there was this suspense that built because the actual tweets , you had no control over when you would read them .
They were coming at a pretty regular clip , but as the story was building , normally , as a reader , you control how fast you move through a text , but in this case , The New Yorker did , and they were sending you bit by bit by bit , and you had this suspense of waiting for the next line .
Another great example of fiction and the short story on Twitter , Elliott Holt is an author who wrote a story called &quot; Evidence . &quot;
It began with this tweet : &quot; On November 28 at 10 : 13 p.m. , a woman identified as Miranda Brown , 44 , of Brooklyn , fell to her death from the roof of a Manhattan hotel . &quot;
It begins in Elliott &apos;s voice , but then Elliott &apos;s voice recedes , and we hear the voices of Elsa , Margot and Simon , characters that Elliott created on Twitter specifically to tell this story , a story from multiple perspectives leading up to this moment at 10 : 13 p.m.
when this woman falls to her death .
These three characters brought an authentic vision from multiple perspectives .
One reviewer called Elliott &apos;s story &quot; Twitter fiction done right , &quot; because she did .
She captured that voice and she had multiple characters and it happened in real time .
Interestingly , though , it wasn &apos;t just Twitter as a distribution mechanism .
It was also Twitter as a production mechanism .
Elliott told me later she wrote the whole thing with her thumbs .
She laid on the couch and just went back and forth between different characters tweeting out each line , line by line .
I think that this kind of spontaneous creation of what was coming out of the characters &apos; voices really lent an authenticity to the characters themselves , but also to this format that she had created of multiple perspectives in a single story on Twitter .
As you begin to play with flexible identity online , it gets even more interesting as you start to interact with the real world .
Things like Invisible Obama or the famous &quot; binders full of women &quot; that came up during the 2012 election cycle , or even the fan fiction universe of &quot; West Wing &quot; Twitter in which you have all of these accounts for every single one of the characters in &quot; The West Wing , &quot; including the bird that taps at Josh Lyman &apos;s window in one single episode .
All of these are rapid iterations on a theme .
They are creative people experimenting with the bounds of what is possible in this medium .
You look at something like &quot; West Wing &quot; Twitter , in which you have these fictional characters that engage with the real world .
They comment on politics , they cry out against the evils of Congress .
Keep in mind , they &apos;re all Democrats .
And they engage with the real world .
They respond to it .
So once you take flexible identity , anonymity , engagement with the real world , and you move beyond simple homage or parody and you put these tools to work in telling a story , that &apos;s when things get really interesting .
So during the Chicago mayoral election there was a parody account .
It was Mayor Emanuel .
It gave you everything you wanted from Rahm Emanuel , particularly in the expletive department .
This foul-mouthed account followed the daily activities of the race , providing commentary as it went .
It followed all of the natural tropes of a good , solid Twitter parody account , but then started to get weird .
And as it progressed , it moved from this commentary to a multi-week , real-time science fiction epic in which your protagonist , Rahm Emanuel , engages in multi-dimensional travel on election day , which is -- it didn &apos;t actually happen .
I double checked the newspapers .
And then , very interestingly , it came to an end .
This is something that doesn &apos;t usually happen with a Twitter parody account .
It ended , a true narrative conclusion .
And so the author , Dan Sinker , who was a journalist , who was completely anonymous this whole time , I think Dan -- it made a lot of sense for him to turn this into a book , because it was a narrative format in the end , and I think that turning it into a book is representative of this idea that he had created something new that needed to be translated into previous formats .
One of my favorite examples of something that &apos;s happening on Twitter right now , actually , is the very absurdist Crimer Show .
Crimer Show tells the story of a supercriminal and a hapless detective that face off in this exceptionally strange lingo , with all of the tropes of a television show .
Crimer Show &apos;s creator has said that it is a parody of a popular type of show in the U.K. , but , man , is it weird .
And there are all these times where Crimer , the supercriminal , does all of these TV things .
He &apos;s always taking off his sunglasses or turning to the camera , but these things just happen in text .
I think borrowing all of these tropes from television and additionally presenting each Crimer Show as an episode , spelled E-P-P-A-S-O-D , &quot; eppasod , &quot; presenting them as episodes really , it creates something new .
There is a new &quot; eppasod &quot; of Crimer Show on Twitter pretty much every day , and they &apos;re archived that way .
And I think this is an interesting experiment in format .
Something totally new has been created here out of parodying something on television .
I think in nonfiction real-time storytelling , there are a lot of really excellent examples as well .
RealTimeWWII is an account that documents what was happening on this day 60 years ago in exceptional detail , as if you were reading the news reports from that day .
And the author Teju Cole has done a lot of experimentation with putting a literary twist on events of the news .
In this particular case , he &apos;s talking about drone strikes .
I think that in both of these examples , you &apos;re beginning to see ways in which people are telling stories with nonfiction content that can be built into new types of fictional storytelling .
So with real-time storytelling , blurring the lines between fact and fiction , the real world and the digital world , flexible identity , anonymity , these are all tools that we have accessible to us , and I think that they &apos;re just the building blocks .
They are the bits that we use to create the structures , the frames , that then become our settlements on this wide open frontier for creative experimentation .
Thank you .

Catherine Bracy : Why good hackers make good citizens
Hacking is about more than mischief-making or political subversion . As Catherine Bracy describes in this spirited talk , it can be just as much a force for good as it is for evil . She spins through some inspiring civically-minded projects in Honolulu , Oakland and Mexico City ‚Äî and makes a compelling case that we all have what it takes to get involved .
I &apos;m going to talk about hackers .
And the image that comes to your mind when I say that word is probably not of Benjamin Franklin , but I &apos;m going to explain to you why it should be .
The image that comes to your mind is probably more likely of a pasty kid sitting in a basement doing something mischievous , or of a shady criminal who is trying to steal your identity , or of an international rogue with a political agenda .
And mainstream culture has kind of fed this idea that hackers are people that we should be afraid of .
But like most things in technology and the technology world , hacking has equal power for good as it has for evil .
For every hacker that &apos;s trying to steal your identity there &apos;s one that &apos;s building a tool that will help you find your loved ones after a disaster or to monitor environmental quality after an oil spill .
Hacking is really just any amateur innovation on an existing system , and it is a deeply democratic activity .
It &apos;s about critical thinking .
It &apos;s about questioning existing ways of doing things .
It &apos;s the idea that if you see a problem , you work to fix it , and not just complain about it .
And in many ways , hacking is what built America .
Betsy Ross was a hacker .
The Underground Railroad was a brilliant hack .
And from the Wright brothers to Steve Jobs , hacking has always been at the foundation of American democracy .
So if there &apos;s one thing I want to leave you here with today , it &apos;s that the next time you think about who a hacker is , you think not of this guy but of this guy , Benjamin Franklin , who was one of the greatest hackers of all time .
He was one of America &apos;s most prolific inventors , though he famously never filed a patent , because he thought that all human knowledge should be freely available .
He brought us bifocals and the lightning rod , and of course there was his collaboration on the invention of American democracy .
And in Code For America , we really try to embody the spirit of Ben Franklin .
He was a tinkerer and a statesman whose conception of citizenship was always predicated on action .
He believed that government could be built by the people , and we call those people civic hackers .
So it &apos;s no wonder that the values that underly a healthy democracy , like collaboration and empowerment and participation and enterprise , are the same values that underly the Internet .
And so it &apos;s no surprise that many hackers are turning their attention to the problem of government .
But before I give you a few examples of what civic hacking looks like , I want to make clear that you don &apos;t have to be a programmer to be a civic hacker .
You just have to believe that you can bring a 21st-century tool set to bear on the problems that government faces .
And we hear all the time from our community of civic hackers at Code for America that they didn &apos;t understand how much nontechnical work actually went into civic hacking projects .
So keep that in mind .
All of you are potential civic hackers .
So what does civic hacking look like ?
Our team last year in Honolulu , which in this case was three full-time fellows who were doing a year of public service , were asked by the city to rebuild the website .
And it &apos;s a massive thing of tens of thousands of pages which just wasn &apos;t going to be possible in the few months that they had .
So instead , they decided to build a parallel site that better conformed to how citizens actually want to interact with information on a city website .
They &apos;re looking for answers to questions , and they want to take action when they &apos;re done , which is really hard to do from a site that looks like this .
So our team built Honolulu Answers , which is a super-simple search interface where you enter a search term or a question and get back plain language answers that drive a user towards action .
Now the site itself was easy enough to build , but the team was faced with the challenge of how they populate all of the content .
It would have taken the three of them a very long time , especially given that none of them are actually from Honolulu .
And so they did something that &apos;s really radical , when you think about how government is used to working .
They asked citizens to write the content .
So you &apos;ve heard of a hack-a-thon .
They held a write-a-thon , where on one Saturday afternoon -- ‚Äî Wild pigs are a huge problem in Honolulu , apparently .
In one Saturday afternoon , they were able to populate most of the content for most of the frequently asked questions , but more importantly than that , they created a new way for citizens to participate in their government .
Now , I think this is a really cool story in and of itself , but it gets more awesome .
On the National Day of Civic Hacking this past June in Oakland , where I live , the Code For America team in Oakland took the open source code base of Honolulu Answers and turned it into Oakland Answers , and again we held a write-a-thon where we took the most frequently asked questions and had citizens write the answers to them , and I got into the act .
I authored this answer , and a few others .
And I &apos;m trying to this day to articulate the sense of empowerment and responsibility that I feel for the place that I live based simply on this small act of participation .
And by stitching together my small act with the thousands of other small acts of participation that we &apos;re enabling through civic hacking , we think we can reenergize citizenship and restore trust in government .
At this point , you may be wondering what city officials think of all this .
They actually love it .
As most of you guys know , cities are being asked every day to do more with less , and they &apos;re always looking for innovative solutions to entrenched problems .
So when you give citizens a way to participate beyond attending a town hall meeting , cities can actually capture the capacity in their communities to do the business of government .
Now I don &apos;t want to leave the impression that civic hacking is just an American phenomenon .
It &apos;s happening across the globe , and one of my favorite examples is from Mexico City , where earlier this year , the Mexico House of Representatives entered into a contract with a software development firm to build an app that legislators would use to track bills .
So this was just for the handful of legislators in the House .
And the contract was a two-year contract for 9.3 million dollars .
Now a lot of people were really angry about this , especially geeks who knew that 9.3 million dollars was an absolutely outrageous amount of money for what was a very simple app .
But instead of taking to the streets , they issued a challenge .
They asked programmers in Mexico to build something better and cheaper , and they offered a prize of 9,300 dollars -- 10,000 times cheaper than the government contract , and they gave the entrants 10 days .
And in those 10 days , they submitted 173 apps , five of which were presented to Congress and are still in the app store today .
And because of this action , that contract was vacated , and now this has sparked a movement in Mexico City which is home to one of our partners , Code for Mexico City .
And so what you see in all three of these places , in Honolulu and in Oakland and in Mexico City , are the elements that are at the core of civic hacking .
It &apos;s citizens who saw things that could be working better and they decided to fix them , and through that work , they &apos;re creating a 21st-century ecosystem of participation .
They &apos;re creating a whole new set of ways for citizens to be involved , besides voting or signing a petition or protesting .
They can actually build government .
So back to our friend Ben Franklin , who , one of his lesser-known accomplishments was that in 1736 he founded the first volunteer firefighting company in Philadelphia , called a brigade .
And it &apos;s because he and his friends noticed that the city was having trouble keeping up with all the fires that were happening in the city , so in true civic hacker fashion , they built a solution .
And we have our own brigades at Code for America working on the projects that I &apos;ve just described , and we want to ask you to follow in Ben Franklin &apos;s footsteps and come join us .
We have 31 brigades in the U.S.
We are pleased to announce today that we &apos;re opening up the brigade to international cities for the first time , starting with cities in Poland and Japan and Ireland .
You can find out if there &apos;s a brigade where you live at brigade.codeforamerica.org , and if there &apos;s not a brigade where you live , we will help you .
We &apos;ve created a tool kit which also lives at brigade.codeforamerica.org , and we will support you along the way .
Our goal is to create a global network of civic hackers who are innovating on the existing system in order to build tools that will solve entrenched problems , that will support local government , and that will empower citizens .
So please come hack with us .
Thank you .
Ananda Shankar Jayant : Fighting cancer with dance
Renowned classical Indian dancer Ananda Shankar Jayant was diagnosed with cancer in 2008 . She tells her personal story of not only facing the disease but dancing through it , and gives a performance revealing the metaphor of strength that helped her do it .
&#91; Sanskrit &#93; This is an ode to the mother goddess , that most of us in India learn when we are children .
I learned it when I was four at my mother &apos;s knee .
That year she introduced me to dance , and thus began my tryst with classical dance .
Since then -- it &apos;s been four decades now -- I &apos;ve trained with the best in the field , performed across the globe , taught young and old alike , created , collaborated , choreographed , and wove a rich tapestry of artistry , achievement and awards .
The crowning glory was in 2007 , when I received this country &apos;s fourth highest civilian award , the Padma Shri , for my contribution to art .
But nothing , nothing prepared me for what I was to hear on the first of July 2008 .
I heard the word &quot; carcinoma . &quot;
Yes , breast cancer .
As I sat dumbstruck in my doctor &apos;s office , I heard other words : &quot; cancer , &quot; &quot; stage , &quot; &quot; grade . &quot;
Until then , Cancer was the zodiac sign of my friend , stage was what I performed on , and grades were what I got in school .
That day , I realized I had an unwelcome , uninvited , new life partner .
As a dancer , I know the nine rasas or the navarasas : anger , valor , disgust , humor and fear .
I thought I knew what fear was .
That day , I learned what fear was .
Overcome with the enormity of it all and the complete feeling of loss of control , I shed copious tears and asked my dear husband , Jayant .
I said , &quot; Is this it ? Is this the end of the road ?
Is this the end of my dance ? &quot;
And he , the positive soul that he is , said , &quot; No , this is just a hiatus , a hiatus during the treatment , and you &apos;ll get back to doing what you do best . &quot;
I realized then that I , who thought I had complete control of my life , had control of only three things : My thought , my mind -- the images that these thoughts created -- and the action that derived from it .
So here I was wallowing in a vortex of emotions and depression and what have you , with the enormity of the situation , wanting to go to a place of healing , health and happiness .
I wanted to go from where I was to where I wanted to be , for which I needed something .
I needed something that would pull me out of all this .
So I dried my tears , and I declared to the world at large ...
I said , &quot; Cancer &apos;s only one page in my life , and I will not allow this page to impact the rest of my life . &quot;
I also declared to the world at large that I would ride it out , and I would not allow cancer to ride me .
But to go from where I was to where I wanted to be , I needed something .
I needed an anchor , an image , a peg to peg this process on , so that I could go from there .
And I found that in my dance , my dance , my strength , my energy , my passion , my very life breath .
But it wasn &apos;t easy .
Believe me , it definitely wasn &apos;t easy .
How do you keep cheer when you go from beautiful to bald in three days ?
How do you not despair when , with the body ravaged by chemotherapy , climbing a mere flight of stairs was sheer torture , that to someone like me who could dance for three hours ?
How do you not get overwhelmed by the despair and the misery of it all ?
All I wanted to do was curl up and weep .
But I kept telling myself fear and tears are options I did not have .
So I would drag myself into my dance studio -- body , mind and spirit -- every day into my dance studio , and learn everything I learned when I was four , all over again , reworked , relearned , regrouped .
It was excruciatingly painful , but I did it .
Difficult .
I focused on my mudras , on the imagery of my dance , on the poetry and the metaphor and the philosophy of the dance itself .
And slowly , I moved out of that miserable state of mind .
But I needed something else .
I needed something to go that extra mile , and I found it in that metaphor which I had learned from my mother when I was four .
The metaphor of Mahishasura Mardhini , of Durga .
Durga , the mother goddess , the fearless one , created by the pantheon of Hindu gods .
Durga , resplendent , bedecked , beautiful , her 18 arms ready for warfare , as she rode astride her lion into the battlefield to destroy Mahishasur .
Durga , the epitome of creative feminine energy , or shakti .
Durga , the fearless one .
I made that image of Durga and her every attribute , her every nuance , my very own .
Powered by the symbology of a myth and the passion of my training , I brought laser-sharp focus into my dance , laser-sharp focus to such an extent that I danced a few weeks after surgery .
I danced through chemo and radiation cycles , much to the dismay of my oncologist .
I danced between chemo and radiation cycles and badgered him to fit it to my performing dance schedule .
What I had done is I had tuned out of cancer and tuned into my dance .
Yes , cancer has just been one page in my life .
My story is a story of overcoming setbacks , obstacles and challenges that life throws at you .
My story is the power of thought .
My story is the power of choice .
It &apos;s the power of focus .
It &apos;s the power of bringing ourselves to the attention of something that so animates you , so moves you , that something even like cancer becomes insignificant .
My story is the power of a metaphor .
It &apos;s the power of an image .
Mine was that of Durga , Durga the fearless one .
She was also called Simhanandini , the one who rode the lion .
As I ride out , as I ride my own inner strength , my own inner resilience , armed as I am with what medication can provide and continue treatment , as I ride out into the battlefield of cancer , asking my rogue cells to behave , I want to be known not as a cancer survivor , but as a cancer conqueror .
I present to you an excerpt of that work &quot; Simhanandini . &quot;
Thomas Dolby : &quot; Love Is a Loaded Pistol &quot;
To write his first studio album in decades , &quot; A Map of the Floating City , &quot; Thomas Dolby has been working in the inspirational setting of a restored lifeboat . At TED2010 he premieres a gorgeous , evocative song from that album -- about one night with a legend . He &apos;s backed by members of the modern string quartet Ethel .
I &apos;ve been playing TED for nearly a decade , and I &apos;ve very rarely played any new songs of my own .
And that was largely because there weren &apos;t any .
So I &apos;ve been busy with a couple of projects , and one of them was this : The Nutmeg .
A 1930s ship &apos;s lifeboat , which I &apos;ve been restoring in the garden of my beach house in England .
And , so now , when the polar ice caps melt , my recording studio will rise up like an ark , and I &apos;ll float off into the drowned world like a character from a J.G. Ballard novel .
During the day , the Nutmeg collects energy from solar panels on the roof of the wheelhouse , and from a 450 watt turbine up the mast .
So that when it gets dark , I &apos;ve got plenty of power .
And I can light up the Nutmeg like a beacon .
And so I go in there until the early hours of the morning , and I work on new songs .
I &apos;d like to play to you guys , if you &apos;re willing to be the first audience to hear it .
It &apos;s about Billie Holiday .
And it appears that , some night in 1947 she left her physical space and was missing all night , until she reappeared in the morning .
But I know where she was .
She was with me on my lifeboat .
And she was hot .
Billie crept softly into my waking arms warm like a sip of sour mash Strange fruit for a sweet hunk of trash Panic at the stage door of Carnegie Hall &quot; Famous Jazz Singer Gone AWOL &quot; Must have left the building body and soul On a creaky piano stool tonight as the moon is my only witness She was breathing in my ear &quot; This time it &apos;s love &quot; But love is a loaded pistol By daybreak she &apos;s gone Over the frozen river , home Me and Johnny Walker See in the new age alone Stay with me again tonight Billie , time , time is a wily trickster Still an echo in my heart says , &quot; This time it &apos;s love &quot;
Jeremy Gilley : One day of peace
Here &apos;s a crazy idea : Persuade the world to try living in peace for just one day , every September 21 . In this energetic , honest talk , Jeremy Gilley tells the story of how this crazy idea became real -- real enough to help millions of kids in war-torn regions .
I was basically concerned about what was going on in the world .
I couldn &apos;t understand the starvation , the destruction , the killing of innocent people .
Making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do .
And when I was 12 , I became an actor .
I was bottom of the class . I haven &apos;t got any qualifications .
I was told I was dyslexic .
In fact , I have got qualifications .
I got a D in pottery , which was the one thing that I did get -- which was useful , obviously .
And so concern is where all of this comes from .
And then , being an actor , I was doing these different kinds of things , and I felt the content of the work that I was involved in really wasn &apos;t cutting it , that there surely had to be more .
And at that point , I read a book by Frank Barnaby , this wonderful nuclear physicist , and he said that media had a responsibility , that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward .
And that fascinated me , because I &apos;d been messing around with a camera most of my life .
And then I thought , well maybe I could do something .
Maybe I could become a filmmaker .
Maybe I can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference .
Maybe there &apos;s a little change I can get involved in .
So I started thinking about peace , and I was obviously , as I said to you , very much moved by these images , trying to make sense of that .
Could I go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on ?
Because it &apos;s obviously incredibly frightening .
But I realized that , having been messing around with structure as an actor , that a series of sound bites in itself wasn &apos;t enough , that there needed to be a mountain to climb , there needed to be a journey that I had to take .
And if I took that journey , no matter whether it failed or succeeded , it would be completely irrelevant .
The point was that I would have something to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil ?
Is the destruction of the world inevitable ? Should I have children ?
Is that a responsible thing to do ? Etc . , etc .
So I was thinking about peace , and then I was thinking , well where &apos;s the starting point for peace ?
And that was when I had the idea .
There was no starting point for peace .
There was no day of global unity .
There was no day of intercultural cooperation .
There was no day when humanity came together , separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we &apos;re in this together , and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated , then that might be the key to humanity &apos;s survival .
That might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day .
So obviously we didn &apos;t have any money .
I was living at my mom &apos;s place .
And we started writing letters to everybody .
You very quickly work out what is it that you &apos;ve got to do to fathom that out .
How do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day , the 21st of September ?
And I wanted it to be the 21st of September because it was my granddad &apos;s favorite number .
He was a prisoner of war .
He saw the bomb go off at Nagasaki .
It poisoned his blood . He died when I was 11 .
So he was like my hero .
And the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left , 23 came back , two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground .
And that &apos;s why we wanted it to be the 21st of September as the date of peace .
So we began this journey , and we launched it in 1999 .
And we wrote to heads of state , their ambassadors , Nobel Peace laureates , NGOs , faiths , various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody .
And very quickly , some letters started coming back .
And we started to build this case .
And I remember the first letter .
One of the first letters was from the Dalai Lama .
And of course we didn &apos;t have the money ; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of &#91; this mail &#93; .
A letter came through from the Dalai Lama saying , &quot; This is an amazing thing . Come and see me .
I &apos;d love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace . &quot;
And we didn &apos;t have money for the flight .
And I rang Sir Bob Ayling , who was CEO of BA at the time , and said , &quot; Mate , we &apos;ve got this invitation .
Could you give me a flight ? Because we &apos;re going to go see him . &quot;
And of course , we went and saw him and it was amazing .
And then Dr. Oscar Arias came forward .
And actually , let me go back to that slide , because when we launched it in 1999 -- this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence -- we invited thousands of people .
Well not thousands -- hundreds of people , lots of people -- all the press , because we were going to try and create the first ever World Peace Day , a peace day .
And we invited everybody , and no press showed up .
There were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family .
And that was kind of like the launch of this thing .
But it didn &apos;t matter because we were documenting , and that was the thing .
For me , it was really about the process .
It wasn &apos;t about the end result .
And that &apos;s the beautiful thing about the camera .
They used to say the pen is mightier than the sword . I think the camera is .
And just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually .
So anyway , we began the journey .
And here you see people like Mary Robinson , I went to see in Geneva .
I &apos;m cutting my hair , it &apos;s getting short and long , because every time I saw Kofi Annan , I was so worried that he thought I was a hippie that I cut it , and that was kind of what was going on .
Yeah , I &apos;m not worried about it now .
So Mary Robinson , she said to me , &quot; Listen , this is an idea whose time has come . This must be created . &quot;
Kofi Annan said , &quot; This will be beneficial to my troops on the ground . &quot;
The OAU at the time , led by Salim Ahmed Salim , said , &quot; I must get the African countries involved . &quot;
Dr. Oscar Arias , Nobel Peace laureate , president now of Costa Rica , said , &quot; I &apos;ll do everything that I can . &quot;
So I went and saw Amr Moussa at the League of Arab States .
I met Mandela at the Arusha peace talks , and so on and so on and so on -- while I was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense .
And then we were listening to the people . We were documenting everywhere .
76 countries in the last 12 years , I &apos;ve visited .
And I &apos;ve always spoken to women and children wherever I &apos;ve gone .
I &apos;ve recorded 44,000 young people .
I &apos;ve recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts .
I &apos;m really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry , their art , their literature , their music , their sport , whatever it might be .
And we were listening to everybody .
And it was an incredibly thing , working with the U.N.
and working with NGOs and building this case .
I felt that I was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day .
And the stronger the case and the more detailed it was , the better chance we had of creating this day .
And it was this stuff , this , where I actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened , it didn &apos;t actually matter .
It didn &apos;t matter if it didn &apos;t create a day of peace .
The fact is that , if I tried and it didn &apos;t work , then I could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite -- until , it was in Somalia , picking up that young girl .
And this young child who &apos;d taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic , and that young boy who was a child soldier , who told me he &apos;d killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that I could just stop .
And that actually , at that moment something happened to me , which obviously made me go , &quot; I &apos;m going to document .
If this is the only film that I ever make , I &apos;m going to document until this becomes a reality . &quot;
Because we &apos;ve got to stop , we &apos;ve got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that , as a young person , is confusing me .
I don &apos;t know how to get involved in that process .
And then on the seventh of September , I was invited to New York .
The Costa Rican government and the British government had put forward to the United Nations General Assembly , with 54 co-sponsors , the idea of the first ever Ceasefire Nonviolence Day , the 21st of September , as a fixed calendar date , and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world .
Yeah , but there were hundreds of individuals , obviously , who made that a reality .
And thank you to all of them .
That was an incredible moment .
I was at the top of the General Assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen .
And as I mentioned , when it started , we were at the Globe , and there was no press .
And now I was thinking , &quot; Well , the press it really going to hear this story . &quot;
And suddenly , we started to institutionalize this day .
Kofi Annan invited me on the morning of September the 11th to do a press conference .
And it was 8 : 00 AM when I stood there .
And I was waiting for him to come down , and I knew that he was on his way .
And obviously he never came down . The statement was never made .
The world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence .
And it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives , there and then subsequently all over the world .
It never happened .
And I remember thinking , &quot; This is exactly why , actually , we have to work even harder .
And we have to make this day work .
It &apos;s been created ; nobody knows .
But we have to continue this journey , and we have to tell people , and we have to prove it can work . &quot;
And I left New York freaked , but actually empowered .
And I felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did , then maybe we wouldn &apos;t see things like that .
I remember putting that film out and going to cynics .
I was showing the film , and I remember being in Israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it &apos;s just a day of peace , it doesn &apos;t mean anything .
It &apos;s not going to work ; you &apos;re not going to stop the fighting in Afghanistan ; the Taliban won &apos;t listen , etc . , etc .
It &apos;s just symbolism .
And that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways , because it couldn &apos;t not work .
I &apos;d spoken in Somalia , Burundi , Gaza , the West Bank , India , Sri Lanka , Congo , wherever it was , and they &apos;d all tell me , &quot; If you can create a window of opportunity , we can move aid , we can vaccinate children .
Children can lead their projects .
They can unite . They can come together . If people would stop , lives will be saved . &quot;
That &apos;s what I &apos;d heard .
And I &apos;d heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about .
And so I went back to the United Nations .
I decided that I &apos;d continue filming and make another movie .
And I went back to the U.N. for another couple of years .
We started moving around the corridors of the U.N. system , governments and NGOs , trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it , see if we could make it possible .
And after lots and lots of meetings obviously , I &apos;m delighted that this man , Ahmad Fawzi , one of my heroes and mentors really , he managed to get UNICEF involved .
And UNICEF , God bless them , they said , &quot; Okay , we &apos;ll have a go . &quot;
And then UNAMA became involved in Afghanistan .
It was historical . Could it work in Afghanistan with UNAMA and WHO and civil society , etc . , etc . , etc . ?
And I was getting it all on film and I was recording it , and I was thinking , &quot; This is it . This is the possibility of it maybe working .
But even if it doesn &apos;t , at least the door is open and there &apos;s a chance . &quot;
And so I went back to London , and I went and saw this chap , Jude Law .
And I saw him because he was an actor , I was an actor , I had a connection to him , because we needed to get to the press , we needed this attraction , we needed the media to be involved .
Because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there &apos;d be more -- when we got into certain areas , maybe there would be more people interested .
And maybe we &apos;d be helped financially a little bit more , which had been desperately difficult .
I won &apos;t go into that .
So Jude said , &quot; Okay , I &apos;ll do some statements for you . &quot;
While I was filming these statements , he said to me , &quot; Where are you going next ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to go to Afghanistan . &quot; He said , &quot; Really ? &quot;
And I could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest .
So I said to him , &quot; Do you want to come with me ?
It &apos;d be really interesting if you came .
It would help and bring attention .
And that attention would help leverage the situation , as well as all of the other sides of it . &quot;
I think there &apos;s a number of pillars to success .
One is you &apos;ve got to have a great idea .
The other is you &apos;ve got to have a constituency , you &apos;ve got to have finance , and you &apos;ve got to be able to raise awareness .
And actually I could never raise awareness by myself , no matter what I &apos;d achieved .
So these guys were absolutely crucial .
So he said yes , and we found ourselves in Afghanistan .
It was a really incredible thing that when we landed there , I was talking to various people , and they were saying to me , &quot; You &apos;ve got to get everybody involved here .
You can &apos;t just expect it to work . You have to get out and work . &quot;
And we did , and we traveled around , and we spoke to elders , we spoke to doctors , we spoke to nurses , we held press conferences , we went out with soldiers , we sat down with ISAF , we sat down with NATO , we sat down with the U.K. government .
I mean , we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with ministers of education , holding these press conferences , which of course , now were loaded with press , everybody was there .
There was an interest in what was going on .
This amazing woman , Fatima Gailani , was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the Russians .
And her Afghan network was just absolutely everywhere .
And she was really crucial in getting the message in .
And then we went home . We &apos;d sort of done it .
We had to wait now and see what happened .
And I got home , and I remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the Taliban .
And that letter basically said , &quot; We &apos;ll observe this day .
We will observe this day .
We see it as a window of opportunity .
And we will not engage . We &apos;re not going to engage . &quot;
And that meant that humanitarian workers wouldn &apos;t be kidnapped or killed .
And then suddenly , I obviously knew at this point , there was a chance .
And days later , 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping .
And like the General Assembly , obviously the most wonderful , wonderful moment .
And so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back .
We put it into Dari and Pashto . We put it in the local dialects .
We went back to Afghanistan , because the next year was coming , and we wanted to support .
But more importantly , we wanted to go back , because these people in Afghanistan were the heroes .
They were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it , etc . , etc . -- and they made it real .
And we wanted to go back and show them the film and say , &quot; Look , you guys made this possible . And thank you very much . &quot;
And we gave the film over .
Obviously it was shown , and it was amazing .
And then that year , that year , 2008 , this ISAF statement from Kabul , Afghanistan , September 17th : &quot; General Stanley McChrystal , commander of international security assistance forces in Afghanistan , announced today ISAF will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of September . &quot;
They were saying they would stop .
And then there was this other statement that came out from the U.N. Department of Security and Safety saying that , in Afghanistan , because of this work , the violence was down by 70 percent .
70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least .
And that completely blew my mind almost more than anything .
And I remember being stuck in New York , this time because of the volcano , which was obviously much less harmful .
And I was there thinking about what was going on .
And I kept thinking about this 70 percent .
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn &apos;t do .
And that made me think that , if we can get 70 percent in Afghanistan , then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere .
We have to go for a global truce .
We have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce , go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities , both domestically and internationally , ever recorded .
That &apos;s exactly what we must do .
And on the 21st of September this year , we &apos;re going to launch that campaign at the O2 Arena to go for that process , to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities .
And we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on Facebook and visit the website , sign the petition .
And it &apos;s in the six official languages of the United Nations .
And we &apos;ll globally link with government , inter-government , non-government , education , unions , sports .
And you can see the education box there .
We &apos;ve got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce .
And obviously the life-saving is increased , the concepts help .
Linking up with the Olympics -- I went and saw Seb Coe . I said , &quot; London 2012 is about truce .
Ultimately , that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . &quot;
Why don &apos;t we all team up ? Why don &apos;t we bring truce to life ?
Why don &apos;t you support the process of the largest ever global truce ?
We &apos;ll make a new film about this process .
We &apos;ll utilize sport and football .
On the Day of Peace , there &apos;s thousands of football matches all played , from the favelas of Brazil to wherever it might be .
So , utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action .
And ultimately , we have to try that .
We have to work together .
And when I stand here in front of all of you , and the people who will watch these things , I &apos;m excited , on behalf of everybody I &apos;ve met , that there is a possibility that our world could unite , that we could come together as one , that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues , brought about by individuals .
I was with Brahimi , Ambassador Brahimi .
I think he &apos;s one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics -- in Afghanistan , in Iraq .
He &apos;s an amazing man .
And I sat with him a few weeks ago .
And I said to him , &quot; Mr. Brahimi , is this nuts , going for a global truce ?
Is this possible ? Is it really possible that we could do this ? &quot;
He said , &quot; It &apos;s absolutely possible . &quot;
I said , &quot; What would you do ?
Would you go to governments and lobby and use the system ? &quot;
He said , &quot; No , I &apos;d talk to the individuals . &quot;
It &apos;s all about the individuals .
It &apos;s all about you and me .
It &apos;s all about partnerships .
It &apos;s about your constituencies ; it &apos;s about your businesses .
Because together , by working together , I seriously think we can start to change things .
And there &apos;s a wonderful man sitting in this audience , and I don &apos;t know where he is , who said to me a few days ago -- because I did a little rehearsal -- and he said , &quot; I &apos;ve been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares , and one of them is white . &quot;
And it then made me think about a glass of water , which is clear .
If you put one drop , one drop of something , in that water , it &apos;ll change it forever .
By working together , we can create peace one day .
Thank you TED . Thank you .
Thank you .
Thanks a lot .
Thank you very much . Thank you .
Norman Spack : How I help transgender teens become who they want to be
Puberty is an awkward time for just about everybody , but for transgender teens it can be a nightmare , as they grow overnight into bodies they aren &apos;t comfortable with . In a heartfelt talk , endocrinologist Norman Spack tells a personal story of how he became one of the few doctors in the US to treat minors with hormone replacement therapy . By staving off the effects of puberty , Spack gives trans teens the time they need .
I want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you , or if you were delivering , about the person you were delivering .
And you can all mouth it if you want or say it out loud .
It was , the first two were , &quot; It &apos;s a ... &quot;
Well , it shows you that I also deal with issues where there &apos;s not certainty of whether it &apos;s a girl or a boy , so the mixed answer was very appropriate .
Of course , now the answer often comes not at birth but at the ultrasound , unless the prospective parents choose to be surprised like we all were .
But I want you to think about what it is that leads to that statement on the third word , because the third word is a description of your sex , and by that I mean , made by a description of your genitals .
Now , as a pediatric endocrinologist , I used to be very , very involved , and still somewhat am , in cases in which there are mismatches in the externals or between the externals and the internals , and we literally have to figure out what is the description of your sex .
But there is nothing that is definable at the time of birth that would define you , and when I talk about definition , I &apos;m talking about your sexual orientation .
We don &apos;t say , &quot; It &apos;s a gay boy . &quot;
&quot; A lesbian girl . &quot;
Those situations don &apos;t really define themselves more until the second decade of life .
Nor do they define your gender , which , as different from your anatomic sex , describes your self-concept .
Do you see yourself as a male or female or somewhere in the spectrum in between ?
That sometimes shows up in the first decade of life , but it can be very confusing for parents because it is quite normative for children to act in a cross-gender play and way , and that in fact there are studies that show that even 80 percent of children who act in that fashion will not persist in wanting to be the opposite gender at the time when puberty begins .
But at the time that puberty begins , that means between about age 10 to 12 in girls , 12 to 14 in boys , with breast budding or two to three times increase in the gonads in the case of genetic males , by that particular point , the child who says they are in the absolute wrong body is almost certain to be transgender and is extremely unlikely to change those feelings , no matter how anybody tries reparative therapy or any other noxious things .
Now this is relatively rare , so I had relatively little personal experience with this , and my experience was more typical only because I had an adolescent practice .
And I saw someone age 24 , went through Harvard , genetically female , went through Harvard with three male roommates who knew the whole story , a registrar who always listed his name on course lists as a male name , and came to me after graduating saying , &quot; Help me .
I know you know a lot of endocrinology . &quot;
And indeed I &apos;ve treated a lot of people who were born without gonads .
This wasn &apos;t rocket science .
But I made a deal with him : I &apos;ll treat you if you teach me .
And so he did .
And what an education I got from taking care of all the members of his support group .
And then I got really confused , because I thought it was relatively easy at that age to just give people the hormones of the gender in which they were affirming , but then my patient married , and he married a woman who had been born as a male , had married as a male , had two children , then went through a transition into female , and now this delightful female was attached to my male patient , in fact got legally married because they showed up as a man and a woman , and who knew ?
Right ?
And while I was confused about , does this make so-and-so gay ?
Does this make so-and-so straight ?
I was getting sexual orientation confused with gender identity .
And my patient said to me , &quot; Look , look , look .
If you just think of the following , you &apos;ll get it right : Sexual orientation is who you go to bed with ; gender identity is who you go to bed as . &quot;
And I subsequently learned from the many adults -- I took care of about 200 adults ‚Äî I learned from them that if I didn &apos;t look , peek as to who their partner was in the waiting room , I would never be able to guess better than chance whether they were gay , straight , bi , or asexual in their affirmed gender .
In other words , one thing has absolutely nothing to do with the other .
And the data show it .
Now , as I took care of the 200 adults , I found it extremely painful .
These people were -- many of them had to give up so much of their lives .
Sometimes their parents would reject them , siblings , their own children , and then their divorcing spouse would forbid them from seeing their children .
It was so awful , but why did they do it at 40 and 50 ?
Because they felt they had to affirm themselves before they would kill themselves .
And indeed , the rate of suicide among untreated transgendered people is among the highest in the world .
So what to do ?
I was intrigued in going to a conference in Holland , where they are experts in this , and saw the most remarkable thing .
They were treating young adolescents after giving them the most intense psychometric testing of gender , and they were treating them by blocking the puberty that they didn &apos;t want .
Because basically , kids look about the same , each sex , until they go through puberty , at which point , if you feel you &apos;re in the wrong sex , you feel like Pinocchio becoming a donkey .
The fantasy that you had that your body will change to be who you want it to be with puberty actually is nullified by the puberty you get .
And they fall apart .
So that &apos;s why putting the puberty on hold ‚Äî Why on hold ? You can &apos;t just give them the opposite hormones that young .
They &apos;ll end up stunted in growth , and you think you can have a meaningful conversation about the fertility effects of such treatment with a 10-year-old girl , a 12-year-old boy ?
So this buys time in the diagnostic process for four or five years so that they can work it out , they can have more and more testing , they can live without feeling their bodies are running away from them .
And then , in a program they call 12-16-18 , around age 12 is when they give the blocking hormones , and then at age 16 with retesting , they requalify .
Now remember , the blocking hormones are reversible , but when you give the hormones of the opposite sex , you now start spouting breasts and facial hair and voice , depending on what you &apos;re using , and those effects are permanent or require surgery to remove or electrolysis , and you can never really affect the voice .
So this is serious , and this is 15- , 16-year-old stuff .
And then at 18 , they &apos;re eligible for surgery , and while there &apos;s no good surgery for females to males genitally , the male-to-female surgery has fooled gynecologists .
That &apos;s how good it can be .
So I looked at how the patients were doing , and I looked at patients who just looked like everybody else , except they were pubertally delayed .
But once they gave them the hormones consistent with the gender they affirm , they look beautiful .
They look normal . They had normal heights .
in a crowd .
So at that point , I decided I &apos;m going to do this .
This is really where the pediatric endocrine realm comes in , in kids age 10-12 , 10-14 , that &apos;s pediatric endocrinology .
So I brought some kids in , and this now became the standard of care , and Children &apos;s Hospital was behind it .
By my showing them the kids before and after , people who never got treated and people who wished to be treated , and pictures of the Dutch , they came to me and said , &quot; You &apos;ve got to do something for these kids . &quot;
Well , where were these kids before ?
They were out there suffering , is where they were .
So we started a program in 2007 .
It became the first program of its kind -- but it &apos;s really of the Dutch kind -- in North America .
And since then , we have 160 patients .
Did they come from Afghanistan ? No .
They came , 75 percent of them came from within 150 miles of Boston .
And some came from England .
Jackie had been abused in the Midlands , in England .
She &apos;s 12 years old there , she was living as a girl but she was being beaten up .
It was a horror show .
They had to homeschool her .
And the reason the British were coming was because they would not treat anybody with anything under age 16 , which means they were consigning them to an adult body , no matter what happened , even if they tested them well .
Jackie , on top of it , was , by virtue of skeletal markings , destined to be six feet five .
And yet , she had just begun a male puberty .
Well , I did something a little bit innovative , because I do know hormones , and that estrogen is much more potent in closing epiphyses , the growth plates , and stopping growth , than testosterone is .
So we blocked her testosterone with a blocking hormone , but we added estrogen , not at 16 , but at 13 .
And so here she is at 16 , on the left .
And on her 16th birthday , she went to Thailand , where they would do a genital plastic surgery .
They will do it at 18 now .
And she ended up 5 &apos; 11 &quot; but more than that , she has normal breast size , because by blocking testosterone , every one of our patients has normal breast size if they get to us at the appropriate age , not too late .
And on the far right , there she is .
She went public , semifinalist in the Miss England competition .
The judges debated as to , can they do this ?
Can they make her ‚Äî And one of them quipped , I &apos;m told , &quot; But she has more natural self than half the other contestants . &quot;
And some of them have been rearranged a little bit , but it &apos;s all her DNA .
And she &apos;s become a remarkable spokeswoman .
And she was offered contracts as a model , at which point she teased me , where she said , &quot; You know , I might have had a better chance as a model if you &apos;d made me six feet one . &quot;
Go figure .
So this picture , I think , says it all .
It really says it all .
These are Nicole and brother Jonas , identical twin boys , and proven to be identical , in which Nicole had affirmed herself as a girl as early as age three .
At age seven , they changed her name , and came to me at the very beginnings of a male puberty .
Now you can imagine looking at Jonas at only 14 that male puberty is early in this family , because he looks more like a 16-year-old , but it makes the point all the more why you have to be conscious of where the patient is .
Nicole has done pubertal blockade in here , and Jonas is just going -- biologic control .
This is what Nicole would look like if we weren &apos;t doing what we were doing .
He &apos;s got a prominent Adam &apos;s apple .
He &apos;s got angular bones to the face , a mustache , and you can see there &apos;s a height difference because he &apos;s gone through a growth spurt that she won &apos;t get .
Now Nicole is on estrogen .
She has a bit of a form to her .
This family went to the White House last spring because of their work in overturning an anti-discrimination , there was a bill that would block the right of transgender people in Maine to use public bathrooms , and it looked like the bill was going to pass , and that would have been a problem , but Nicole went personally to every legislator in Maine and said , &quot; I can do this .
If they see me , they &apos;ll understand why I &apos;m no threat in the lady &apos;s room , but I can be threatened in the men &apos;s room . &quot;
And then they finally got it .
So where do we go from here ?
Well , we still have a ways to go in terms of anti-discrimination .
There are only 17 states that have an anti-discrimination law against discrimination in housing , employment , public accommodation , only 17 states , and five of them are in New England .
We need less expensive drugs .
They cost a fortune .
And we need to get this condition out of the DSM .
It is as much a psychiatric disease as being gay and lesbian , and that went out the window in 1973 , and the whole world changed .
And this isn &apos;t going to break anybody &apos;s budget .
This is not that common .
But the risks of not doing anything for them not only puts all of them at risk of losing their lives to suicide , but it also says something about whether we are a truly inclusive society .
Thank you .
Melinda Gates : What nonprofits can learn from Coca-Cola
In her talk , Melinda Gates makes a provocative case for nonprofits taking a cue from corporations such as Coca-Cola , whose plugged-in , global network of marketers and distributors ensures that every remote village wants -- and can get -- a Coke . Why shouldn &apos;t this work for condoms , sanitation , vaccinations too ? &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
One of my favorite parts of my job at the Gates Foundation is that I get to travel to the developing world , and I do that quite regularly .
And when I meet the mothers in so many of these remote places , I &apos;m really struck by the things that we have in common .
They want what we want for our children and that is for their children to grow up successful , to be healthy , and to have a successful life .
But I also see lots of poverty , and it &apos;s quite jarring , both in the scale and the scope of it .
My first trip in India , I was in a person &apos;s home where they had dirt floors , no running water , no electricity , and that &apos;s really what I see all over the world .
So in short , I &apos;m startled by all the things that they don &apos;t have .
But I am surprised by one thing that they do have : Coca-Cola .
Coke is everywhere .
In fact , when I travel to the developing world , Coke feels ubiquitous .
And so when I come back from these trips , and I &apos;m thinking about development , and I &apos;m flying home and I &apos;m thinking , &quot; We &apos;re trying to deliver condoms to people or vaccinations , &quot; you know , Coke &apos;s success kind of stops and makes you wonder : how is it that they can get Coke to these far-flung places ?
If they can do that , why can &apos;t governments and NGOs do the same thing ?
And I &apos;m not the first person to ask this question .
But I think , as a community , we still have a lot to learn .
It &apos;s staggering , if you think about Coca-Cola .
They sell 1.5 billion servings every single day .
That &apos;s like every man , woman and child on the planet having a serving of Coke every week .
So why does this matter ?
Well , if we &apos;re going to speed up the progress and go even faster on the set of Millennium Development Goals that we &apos;re set as a world , we need to learn from the innovators , and those innovators come from every single sector .
I feel that , if we can understand what makes something like Coca-Cola ubiquitous , we can apply those lessons then for the public good .
Coke &apos;s success is relevant , because if we can analyze it , learn from it , then we can save lives .
So that &apos;s why I took a bit of time to study Coke .
And I think there are really three things we can take away from Coca-Cola .
They take real-time data and immediately feed it back into the product .
They tap into local entrepreneurial talent , and they do incredible marketing .
So let &apos;s start with the data .
Now Coke has a very clear bottom line -- they report to a set of shareholders , they have to turn a profit .
So they take the data , and they use it to measure progress .
They have this very continuous feedback loop .
They learn something , they put it back into the product , they put it back into the market .
They have a whole team called &quot; Knowledge and Insight . &quot;
It &apos;s a lot like other consumer companies .
So if you &apos;re running Namibia for Coca-Cola , and you have a 107 constituencies , you know where every can versus bottle of Sprite , Fanta or Coke was sold , whether it was a corner store , a supermarket or a pushcart .
So if sales start to drop , then the person can identify the problem and address the issue .
Let &apos;s contrast that for a minute to development .
In development , the evaluation comes at the very end of the project .
I &apos;ve sat in a lot of those meetings , and by then , it is way too late to use the data .
I had somebody from an NGO once describe it to me as bowling in the dark .
They said , &quot; You roll the ball , you hear some pins go down .
It &apos;s dark , you can &apos;t see which one goes down until the lights come on , and then you an see your impact . &quot;
Real-time data turns on the lights .
So what &apos;s the second thing that Coke &apos;s good at ?
They &apos;re good at tapping into that local entrepreneurial talent .
Coke &apos;s been in Africa since 1928 , but most of the time they couldn &apos;t reach the distant markets , because they had a system that was a lot like in the developed world , which was a large truck rolling down the street .
And in Africa , the remote places , it &apos;s hard to find a good road .
But Coke noticed something -- they noticed that local people were taking the product , buying it in bulk and then reselling it in these hard-to-reach places .
And so they took a bit of time to learn about that .
And they decided in 1990 that they wanted to start training the local entrepreneurs , giving them small loans .
They set them up as what they called micro-distribution centers , and those local entrepreneurs then hire sales people , who go out with bicycles and pushcarts and wheelbarrows to sell the product .
There are now some 3,000 of these centers employing about 15,000 people in Africa .
In Tanzania and Uganda , they represent 90 percent of Coke &apos;s sales .
Let &apos;s look at the development side .
What is it that governments and NGOs can learn from Coke ?
Governments and NGOs need to tap into that local entrepreneurial talent as well , because the locals know how to reach the very hard-to-serve places , their neighbors , and they know what motivates them to make change .
I think a great example of this is Ethiopia &apos;s new health extension program .
The government noticed in Ethiopia that many of the people were so far away from a health clinic , they were over a day &apos;s travel away from a health clinic .
So if you &apos;re in an emergency situation -- or if you &apos;re a mom about to deliver a baby -- forget it , to get to the health care center .
They decided that wasn &apos;t good enough , so they went to India and studied the Indian state of Kerala that also had a system like this , and they adapted it for Ethiopia .
And in 2003 , the government of Ethiopia started this new system in their own country .
They trained 35,000 health extension workers to deliver care directly to the people .
In just five years , their ratio went from one worker for every 30,000 people to one worker for every 2,500 people .
Now , think about how this can change people &apos;s lives .
Health extension workers can help with so many things , whether it &apos;s family planning , prenatal care , immunizations for the children , or advising the woman to get to the facility on time for an on-time delivery .
That is having real impact in a country like Ethiopia , and it &apos;s why you see their child mortality numbers coming down 25 percent from 2000 to 2008 .
In Ethiopia , there are hundreds of thousands of children living because of this health extension worker program .
So what &apos;s the next step for Ethiopia ?
Well , they &apos;re already starting talk about this .
They &apos;re starting to talk about , &quot; How do you have the health community workers generate their own ideas ?
How do you incent them based on the impact that they &apos;re getting out in those remote villages ? &quot;
That &apos;s how you tap into local entrepreneurial talent and you unlock people &apos;s potential .
The third component of Coke &apos;s success is marketing .
Ultimately , Coke &apos;s success depends on one crucial fact and that is that people want a Coca-Cola .
Now the reason these micro-entrepreneurs can sell or make a profit is they have to sell every single bottle in their pushcart or their wheelbarrow .
So , they rely on Coca-Cola in terms of its marketing , and what &apos;s the secret to their marketing ?
Well , it &apos;s aspirational .
It is associated that product with a kind of life that people want to live .
So even though it &apos;s a global company , they take a very local approach .
Coke &apos;s global campaign slogan is &quot; Open Happiness . &quot;
But they localize it .
And they don &apos;t just guess what makes people happy ; they go to places like Latin America and they realize that happiness there is associated with family life .
And in South Africa , they associate happiness with seriti or community respect .
Now , that played itself out in the World Cup campaign .
Let &apos;s listen to this song that Coke created for it , &quot; Wavin &apos; Flag &quot; by a Somali hip hop artist .
K &apos;Naan : Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh Oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh o-oh Give you freedom , give you fire Give you reason , take you higher See the champions take the field now You define us , make us feel proud In the streets our heads are lifted As we lose our inhibition Celebration , it &apos;s around us Every nation , all around us Melinda French Gates : It feels pretty good , right ?
Well , they didn &apos;t stop there -- they localized it into 18 different languages .
And it went number one on the pop chart in 17 countries .
It reminds me of a song that I remember from my childhood , &quot; I &apos;d Like to Teach the World to Sing , &quot; that also went number one on the pop charts .
Both songs have something in common : that same appeal of celebration and unity .
So how does health and development market ?
Well , it &apos;s based on avoidance , not aspirations .
I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve heard some of these messages .
&quot; Use a condom , don &apos;t get AIDS . &quot;
&quot; Wash you hands , you might not get diarrhea . &quot;
It doesn &apos;t sound anything like &quot; Wavin &apos; Flag &quot; to me .
And I think we make a fundamental mistake -- we make an assumption , that we think that , if people need something , we don &apos;t have to make them want that .
And I think that &apos;s a mistake .
And there &apos;s some indications around the world that this is starting to change .
One example is sanitation .
We know that a million and a half children die a year from diarrhea and a lot of it is because of open defecation .
But there &apos;s a solution : you build a toilet .
But what we &apos;re finding around the world , over and over again , is , if you build a toilet and you leave it there , it doesn &apos;t get used .
People reuse it for a slab for their home .
They sometimes store grain in it .
I &apos;ve even seen it used for a chicken coop .
But what does marketing really entail that would make a sanitation solution get a result in diarrhea ?
Well , you work with the community .
You start to talk to them about why open defecation is something that shouldn &apos;t be done in the village , and they agree to that .
But then you take the toilet and you position it as a modern , trendy convenience .
One state in Northern India has gone so far as to link toilets to courtship .
And it works -- look at these headlines .
I &apos;m not kidding .
Women are refusing to marry men without toilets .
No loo , no &quot; I do . &quot;
Now , it &apos;s not just a funny headline -- it &apos;s innovative . It &apos;s an innovative marketing campaign .
But more importantly , it saves lives .
Take a look at this -- this is a room full of young men and my husband , Bill .
And can you guess what the young men are waiting for ?
They &apos;re waiting to be circumcised .
Can you you believe that ?
We know that circumcision reduces HIV infection by 60 percent in men .
And when we first heard this result inside the Foundation , I have to admit , Bill and I were scratching our heads a little bit and we were saying , &quot; But who &apos;s going to volunteer for this procedure ? &quot;
But it turns out the men do , because they &apos;re hearing from their girlfriends that they prefer it , and the men also believe it improves their sex life .
So if we can start to understand what people really want in health and development , we can change communities and we can change whole nations .
Well , why is all of this so important ?
So let &apos;s talk about what happens when this all comes together , when you tie the three things together .
And polio , I think , is one of the most powerful examples .
We &apos;ve seen a 99 percent reduction in polio in 20 years .
So if you look back to 1988 , there are about 350,000 cases of polio on the planet that year .
In 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,600 cases .
Well how did that happen ?
Let &apos;s look at a country like India .
They have over a billion people in this country , but they have 35,000 local doctors who report paralysis , and clinicians , a huge reporting system in chemists .
They have two and a half million vaccinators .
But let me make the story a little bit more concrete for you .
Let me tell you the story of Shriram , an 18 month boy in Bihar , a northern state in India .
This year on August 8th , he felt paralysis and on the 13th , his parents took him to the doctor .
On August 14th and 15th , they took a stool sample , and by the 25th of August , it was confirmed he had Type 1 polio .
By August 30th , a genetic test was done , and we knew what strain of polio Shriram had .
Now it could have come from one of two places .
It could have come from Nepal , just to the north , across the border , or from Jharkhand , a state just to the south .
Luckily , the genetic testing proved that , in fact , this strand came north , because , had it come from the south , it would have had a much wider impact in terms of transmission .
So many more people would have been affected .
So what &apos;s the endgame ?
Well on September 4th , there was a huge mop-up campaign , which is what you do in polio .
They went out and where Shriram lives , they vaccinated two million people .
So in less than a month , we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program .
And I &apos;m happy to say only one other person in that area got polio .
That &apos;s how you keep a huge outbreak from spreading , and it shows what can happen when local people have the data in their hands ; they can save lives .
Now one of the challenges in polio , still , is marketing , but it might not be what you think .
It &apos;s not the marketing on the ground .
It &apos;s not telling the parents , &quot; If you see paralysis , take your child to the doctor or get your child vaccinated . &quot;
We have a problem with marketing in the donor community .
The G8 nations have been incredibly generous on polio over the last 20 years , but we &apos;re starting to have something called polio fatigue and that is that the donor nations aren &apos;t willing to fund polio any longer .
So by next summer , we &apos;re sighted to run out of money on polio .
So we are 99 percent of the way there on this goal and we &apos;re about to run short of money .
And I think that if the marketing were more aspirational , if we could focus as a community on how far we &apos;ve come and how amazing it would be to eradicate this disease , we could put polio fatigue and polio behind us .
And if we could do that , we could stop vaccinating everybody , worldwide , in all of our countries for polio .
And it would only be the second disease ever wiped off the face of the planet .
And we are so close .
And this victory is so possible .
So if Coke &apos;s marketers came to me and asked me to define happiness , I &apos;d say my vision of happiness is a mother holding healthy baby in her arms .
To me , that is deep happiness .
And so if we can learn lessons from the innovators in every sector , then in the future we make together , that happiness can be just as ubiquitous as Coca-Cola .
Thank you .
JoAnn Kuchera-Morin : Stunning data visualization in the AlloSphere
JoAnn Kuchera-Morin demos the AlloSphere , a new way to see , hear and interpret scientific data . Dive into the brain , feel electron spin , hear the music of the elements ... and detect previously unseen patterns that could lead to new discoveries .
The AlloSphere : it &apos;s a three-story metal sphere in an echo-free chamber .
Think of the AlloSphere as a large , dynamically varying digital microscope that &apos;s connected to a supercomputer .
20 researchers can stand on a bridge suspended inside of the sphere , and be completely immersed in their data .
Imagine if a team of physicists could stand inside of an atom and watch and hear electrons spin .
Imagine if a group of sculptors could be inside of a lattice of atoms and sculpt with their material .
Imagine if a team of surgeons could fly into the brain , as though it was a world , and see tissues as landscapes , and hear blood density levels as music .
This is some of the research that you &apos;re going to see that we &apos;re undertaking at the AlloSphere .
But first a little bit about this group of artists , scientists , and engineers that are working together .
I &apos;m a composer , orchestrally-trained , and the inventor of the AlloSphere .
With my visual artist colleagues , we map complex mathematical algorithms that unfold in time and space , visually and sonically .
Our scientist colleagues are finding new patterns in the information .
And our engineering colleagues are making one of the largest dynamically varying computers in the world for this kind of data exploration .
I &apos;m going to fly you into five research projects in the AlloSphere that are going to take you from biological macroscopic data all the way down to electron spin .
This first project is called the AlloBrain .
And it &apos;s our attempt to quantify beauty by finding which regions of the brain are interactive while witnessing something beautiful .
You &apos;re flying through the cortex of my colleague &apos;s brain .
Our narrative here is real fMRI data that &apos;s mapped visually and sonically .
The brain now a world that we can fly through and interact with .
You see 12 intelligent computer agents , the little rectangles that are flying in the brain with you .
They &apos;re mining blood density levels .
And they &apos;re reporting them back to you sonically .
Higher density levels mean more activity in that point of the brain .
They &apos;re actually singing these densities to you with higher pitches mapped to higher densities .
We &apos;re now going to move from real biological data to biogenerative algorithms that create artificial nature in our next artistic and scientific installation .
In this artistic and scientific installation , biogenerative algorithms are helping us to understand self-generation and growth : very important for simulation in the nanoscaled sciences .
For artists , we &apos;re making new worlds that we can uncover and explore .
These generative algorithms grow over time , and they interact and communicate as a swarm of insects .
Our researchers are interacting with this data by injecting bacterial code , which are computer programs , that allow these creatures to grow over time .
We &apos;re going to move now from the biological and the macroscopic world , down into the atomic world , as we fly into a lattice of atoms .
This is real AFM -- Atomic Force Microscope -- data from my colleagues in the Solid State Lighting and Energy Center .
They &apos;ve discovered a new bond , a new material for transparent solar cells .
We &apos;re flying through 2,000 lattice of atoms -- oxygen , hydrogen and zinc .
You view the bond in the triangle .
It &apos;s four blue zinc atoms bonding with one white hydrogen atom .
You see the electron flow with the streamlines we as artists have generated for the scientists .
This is allowing them to find the bonding nodes in any lattice of atoms .
We think it makes a beautiful structural art .
The sound that you &apos;re hearing are the actual emission spectrums of these atoms .
We &apos;ve mapped them into the audio domain , so they &apos;re singing to you .
Oxygen , hydrogen and zinc have their own signature .
We &apos;re going to actually move even further down as we go from this lattice of atoms to one single hydrogen atom .
We &apos;re working with our physicist colleagues that have given us the mathematical calculations of the n-dimensional Schr√∂dinger equation in time .
What you &apos;re seeing here right now is a superposition of an electron in the lower three orbitals of a hydrogen atom .
You &apos;re actually hearing and seeing the electron flow with the lines .
The white dots are the probability wave that will show you where the electron is in any given point of time and space in this particular three-orbital configuration .
In a minute we &apos;re going to move to a two-orbital configuration , and you &apos;re going to notice a pulsing .
And you &apos;re going to hear an undulation between the sound .
This is actually a light emitter .
As the sound starts to pulse and contract , our physicists can tell when a photon is going to be emitted .
They &apos;re starting to find new mathematical structures in these calculations .
And they &apos;re understanding more about quantum mathematics .
We &apos;re going to move even further down , and go to one single electron spin .
This will be the final project that I show you .
Our colleagues in the Center for Quantum Computation and Spintronics are actually measuring with their lasers decoherence in a single electron spin .
We &apos;ve taken this information and we &apos;ve made a mathematical model out of it .
You &apos;re actually seeing and hearing quantum information flow .
This is very important for the next step in simulating quantum computers and information technology .
So these brief examples that I &apos;ve shown you give you an idea of the kind of work that we &apos;re doing at the University of California , Santa Barbara , to bring together , arts , science and engineering into a new age of math , science and art .
We hope that all of you will come to see the AlloSphere .
Inspire us to think of new ways that we can use this unique instrument that we &apos;ve created at Santa Barbara .
Thank you very much .
Ben Saunders : Why bother leaving the house ?
Explorer Ben Saunders wants you to go outside ! Not because it &apos;s always pleasant and happy , but because that &apos;s where the meat of life is , &quot; the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days . &quot; Saunders &apos; next outdoor excursion ? To try to be the first in the world to walk from the coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again .
I essentially drag sledges for a living , so it doesn &apos;t take an awful lot to flummox me intellectually , but I &apos;m going to read this question from an interview earlier this year : &quot; Philosophically , does the constant supply of information steal our ability to imagine or replace our dreams of achieving ?
After all , if it is being done somewhere by someone , and we can participate virtually , then why bother leaving the house ? &quot;
I &apos;m usually introduced as a polar explorer .
I &apos;m not sure that &apos;s the most progressive or 21st-century of job titles , but I &apos;ve spent more than two percent now of my entire life living in a tent inside the Arctic Circle , so I get out of the house a fair bit .
And in my nature , I guess , I am a doer of things more than I am a spectator or a contemplator of things , and it &apos;s that dichotomy , the gulf between ideas and action that I &apos;m going to try and explore briefly .
The pithiest answer to the question &quot; why ? &quot;
that &apos;s been dogging me for the last 12 years was credited certainly to this chap , the rakish-looking gentleman standing at the back , second from the left , George Lee Mallory . Many of you will know his name .
In 1924 he was last seen disappearing into the clouds near the summit of Mt . Everest .
He may or may not have been the first person to climb Everest , more than 30 years before Edmund Hillary .
No one knows if he got to the top . It &apos;s still a mystery .
But he was credited with coining the phrase , &quot; Because it &apos;s there . &quot;
Now I &apos;m not actually sure that he did say that .
There &apos;s very little evidence to suggest it , but what he did say is actually far nicer , and again , I &apos;ve printed this . I &apos;m going to read it out .
&quot; The first question which you will ask and which I must try to answer is this : What is the use of climbing Mt . Everest ?
And my answer must at once be , it is no use .
There is not the slightest prospect of any gain whatsoever .
Oh , we may learn a little about the behavior of the human body at high altitudes , and possibly medical men may turn our observation to some account for the purposes of aviation , but otherwise nothing will come of it .
We shall not bring back a single bit of gold or silver , and not a gem , nor any coal or iron .
We shall not find a single foot of earth that can be planted with crops to raise food . So it is no use .
If you cannot understand that there is something in man which responds to the challenge of this mountain and goes out to meet it , that the struggle is the struggle of life itself upward and forever upward , then you won &apos;t see why we go .
What we get from this adventure is just sheer joy , and joy , after all , is the end of life .
We don &apos;t live to eat and make money .
We eat and make money to be able to enjoy life .
That is what life means , and that is what life is for . &quot;
Mallory &apos;s argument that leaving the house , embarking on these grand adventures is joyful and fun , however , doesn &apos;t tally that neatly with my own experience .
The furthest I &apos;ve ever got away from my front door was in the spring of 2004 . I still don &apos;t know exactly what came over me , but my plan was to make a solo and unsupported crossing of the Arctic Ocean .
I planned essentially to walk from the north coast of Russia to the North Pole , and then to carry on to the north coast of Canada .
No one had ever done this . I was 26 at the time .
A lot of experts were saying it was impossible , and my mum certainly wasn &apos;t very keen on the idea .
The journey from a small weather station on the north coast of Siberia up to my final starting point , the edge of the pack ice , the coast of the Arctic Ocean , took about five hours , and if anyone watched fearless Felix Baumgartner going up , rather than just coming down , you &apos;ll appreciate the sense of apprehension , as I sat in a helicopter thundering north , and the sense , I think if anything , of impending doom .
I sat there wondering what on Earth I had gotten myself into .
There was a bit of fun , a bit of joy .
I was 26 . I remember sitting there looking down at my sledge . I had my skis ready to go , I had a satellite phone , a pump-action shotgun in case I was attacked by a polar bear .
I remember looking out of the window and seeing the second helicopter .
We were both thundering through this incredible Siberian dawn , and part of me felt a bit like a cross between Jason Bourne and Wilfred Thesiger . Part of me felt quite proud of myself , but mostly I was just utterly terrified .
And that journey lasted 10 weeks , 72 days .
I didn &apos;t see anyone else . We took this photo next to the helicopter .
Beyond that , I didn &apos;t see anyone for 10 weeks .
The North Pole is slap bang in the middle of the sea , so I &apos;m traveling over the frozen surface of the Arctic Ocean .
NASA described conditions that year as the worst since records began .
I was dragging 180 kilos of food and fuel and supplies , about 400 pounds . The average temperature for the 10 weeks was minus 35 . Minus 50 was the coldest .
So again , there wasn &apos;t an awful lot of joy or fun to be had .
One of the magical things about this journey , however , is that because I &apos;m walking over the sea , over this floating , drifting , shifting crust of ice that &apos;s floating on top of the Arctic Ocean is it &apos;s an environment that &apos;s in a constant state of flux .
The ice is always moving , breaking up , drifting around , refreezing , so the scenery that I saw for nearly 3 months was unique to me . No one else will ever , could ever , possibly see the views , the vistas , that I saw for 10 weeks .
And that , I guess , is probably the finest argument for leaving the house .
I can try to tell you what it was like , but you &apos;ll never know what it was like , and the more I try to explain that I felt lonely , I was the only human being in 5.4 million square-miles , it was cold , nearly minus 75 with windchill on a bad day , the more words fall short , and I &apos;m unable to do it justice .
And it seems to me , therefore , that the doing , you know , to try to experience , to engage , to endeavor , rather than to watch and to wonder , that &apos;s where the real meat of life is to be found , the juice that we can suck out of our hours and days .
And I would add a cautionary note here , however .
In my experience , there is something addictive about tasting life at the very edge of what &apos;s humanly possible .
Now I don &apos;t just mean in the field of daft macho Edwardian style derring-do , but also in the fields of pancreatic cancer , there is something addictive about this , and in my case , I think polar expeditions are perhaps not that far removed from having a crack habit .
I can &apos;t explain quite how good it is until you &apos;ve tried it , but it has the capacity to burn up all the money I can get my hands on , to ruin every relationship I &apos;ve ever had , so be careful what you wish for .
Mallory postulated that there is something in man that responds to the challenge of the mountain , and I wonder if that &apos;s the case whether there &apos;s something in the challenge itself , in the endeavor , and particularly in the big , unfinished , chunky challenges that face humanity that call out to us , and in my experience that &apos;s certainly the case .
There is one unfinished challenge that &apos;s been calling out to me for most of my adult life .
Many of you will know the story .
This is a photo of Captain Scott and his team .
Scott set out just over a hundred years ago to try to become the first person to reach the South Pole .
No one knew what was there . It was utterly unmapped at the time . We knew more about the surface of the moon than we did about the heart of Antarctica .
Scott , as many of you will know , was beaten to it by Roald Amundsen and his Norwegian team , who used dogs and dogsleds . Scott &apos;s team were on foot , all five of them wearing harnesses and dragging around sledges , and they arrived at the pole to find the Norwegian flag already there , I &apos;d imagine pretty bitter and demoralized .
All five of them turned and started walking back to the coast and all five died on that return journey .
There is a sort of misconception nowadays that it &apos;s all been done in the fields of exploration and adventure .
When I talk about Antarctica , people often say , &quot; Hasn &apos;t , you know , that &apos;s interesting , hasn &apos;t that Blue Peter presenter just done it on a bike ? &quot;
Or , &quot; That &apos;s nice . You know , my grandmother &apos;s going on a cruise to Antarctica next year . You know .
Is there a chance you &apos;ll see her there ? &quot;
But Scott &apos;s journey remains unfinished .
No one has ever walked from the very coast of Antarctica to the South Pole and back again .
It is , arguably , the most audacious endeavor of that Edwardian golden age of exploration , and it seemed to me high time , given everything we have figured out in the century since from scurvy to solar panels , that it was high time someone had a go at finishing the job .
So that &apos;s precisely what I &apos;m setting out to do .
This time next year , in October , I &apos;m leading a team of three .
It will take us about four months to make this return journey .
That &apos;s the scale . The red line is obviously halfway to the pole .
We have to turn around and come back again .
I &apos;m well aware of the irony of telling you that we will be blogging and tweeting . You &apos;ll be able to live vicariously and virtually through this journey in a way that no one has ever before .
And it &apos;ll also be a four-month chance for me to finally come up with a pithy answer to the question , &quot; Why ? &quot;
And our lives today are safer and more comfortable than they have ever been . There certainly isn &apos;t much call for explorers nowadays . My career advisor at school never mentioned it as an option .
If I wanted to know , for example , how many stars were in the Milky Way , how old those giant heads on Easter Island were , most of you could find that out right now without even standing up .
And yet , if I &apos;ve learned anything in nearly 12 years now of dragging heavy things around cold places , it is that true , real inspiration and growth only comes from adversity and from challenge , from stepping away from what &apos;s comfortable and familiar and stepping out into the unknown .
In life , we all have tempests to ride and poles to walk to , and I think metaphorically speaking , at least , we could all benefit from getting outside the house a little more often , if only we could summon up the courage .
I certainly would implore you to open the door just a little bit and take a look at what &apos;s outside .
Thank you very much .
Tal Golesworthy : How I repaired my own heart
Tal Golesworthy is a boiler engineer -- he knows piping and plumbing . When he needed surgery to repair a life-threatening problem with his aorta , he mixed his engineering skills with his doctors &apos; medical knowledge to design a better repair job .
I &apos;m a process engineer .
I know all about boilers and incinerators and fabric filters and cyclones and things like that , but I also have Marfan syndrome .
This is an inherited disorder .
And in 1992 I participated in a genetic study and found to my horror , as you can see from the slide , that my ascending aorta was not in the normal range , the green line at the bottom .
Everyone in here will be between 3.2 and 3.6 cm .
I was already up at 4.4 .
And as you can see , my aorta dilated progressively , and I got closer and closer to the point where surgery was going to be necessary .
The surgery on offer was pretty gruesome -- anesthetize you , open your chest , put you on an artificial heart and lung machine , drop your body temperature to about 18 centigrade , stop your heart , cut the aorta out , replace it with a plastic valve and a plastic aorta , and , most importantly , commit you to a lifetime of anticoagulation therapy , normally warfarin .
The thought of the surgery was not attractive .
The thought of the warfarin was really quite frightening .
So I said to myself , I &apos;m an engineer , I &apos;m in R and D , this is just a plumbing problem .
I can do this . I can change this .
So I set out to change the entire treatment for aortic dilation .
The project aim is really quite simple .
The only real problem with the ascending aorta in people with Marfan syndrome is it lacks some tensile strength .
So the possibility exists to simply externally wrap the pipe .
And it would remain stable and operate quite happily .
If your high-pressure hose pipe , or your high-pressure hydraulic line , bulges a little , you just wrap some tape around the outside of it .
It really is that simple in concept , though not in execution .
The great advantage of an external support for me was that I could retain all of my own bits , all of my own endothelium and valves , and not need any anticoagulation therapy .
So where do we start ?
Well this is a sagittal slice through me .
You could see in the middle that device , that little structure , squeezing out .
Now that &apos;s a left ventricle pushing blood up through the aortic valve -- you can see two of the leaflets of the aortic valve working there -- up into the ascending aorta .
And it &apos;s that part , the ascending aorta , which dilates and ultimately bursts , which , of course , is fatal .
We started by organizing image acquisition from magnetic resonance imaging machines and CT imaging machines from which to make a model of the patient &apos;s aorta .
This is a model of my aorta .
I &apos;ve got a real one in my pocket , if anyone would like to look at it and play with it .
You can see , it &apos;s quite a complex structure .
It has a funny trilobal shape at the bottom , which contains the aortic valve .
It then comes back into a round form and then tapers and curves off .
So it &apos;s quite a difficult structure to produce .
This , like I say , is a CAD model of me , and this is one of the later CAD models .
We went through an iterative process of producing better and better models .
When we produced that model we turn it into a solid plastic model , as you can see , using a rapid prototyping technique , another engineering technique .
We then use that former to manufacture a perfectly bespoke porous textile mesh , which takes the shape of the former and perfectly fits the aorta .
So this is absolutely personalized medicine at its best really .
Every patient we do has an absolutely bespoke implant .
Once you &apos;ve made it , the installation &apos;s quite easy .
John Pepper , bless his heart , professor of cardiothoracic surgery -- never done it before in his life -- he put the first one in , didn &apos;t like it , took it out , put the second one in .
Happy , away I went .
Four and a half hours on the table and everything was done .
So the surgical implantation actually was the easiest part .
If you compare our new treatment to the existing alternative , the so-called composite aortic root graft , there are one of two startling comparisons , which I &apos;m sure will be clear to all of you .
Two hours to install one of our devices compared to six hours for the existing treatment .
The existing treatment requires , as I &apos;ve said , the heart and lung bypass machine and it requires a total body cooling .
We don &apos;t need any of that ; we work on a beating heart .
He opens you up , he accesses the aorta while your heart is beating , all at the right temperature .
No breaking into your circulatory system .
So it really is great .
But for me , absolutely the best point is there is no anticoagulation therapy required .
I don &apos;t take any drugs at all other than recreational ones that I would choose to take .
And in fact , if you speak to people who are on long-term warfarin , it is a serious compromise to your quality of life .
And even worse , it inevitably foreshortens your life .
Likewise , if you have the artificial valve option , you &apos;re committed to antibiotic therapy whenever you have any intrusive medical treatment at all .
Even trips to the dentist require that you take antibiotics , in case you get an internal infection on the valve .
Again , I don &apos;t have any of that , so I &apos;m entirely free .
My aorta is fixed , I haven &apos;t got to worry about it , which is a rebirth for me .
Back to the theme of the presentation : In multidisciplinary research , how on earth does a process engineer used to working with boilers end up producing a medical device which transforms his own life ?
Well the answer to that is a multidisciplinary team .
This is a list of the core team .
And as you can see , there are not only two principal technical disciplines there , medicine and engineering , but also there are various specialists from within those two disciplines .
John Pepper there was the cardiac surgeon who did the actual work on me , but everyone else there had to contribute one way or another .
Raad Mohiaddin , medical radiologist : We had to get good quality images from which to make the CAD model .
Warren Thornton , who still does all our CAD models for us , had to write a bespoke piece of CAD code to produce this model from this really rather difficult input data set .
There are some barriers to this though . There are some problems with it .
Jargon is a big one .
I would think no one in this room understands those four first jargon points there .
The engineers amongst you will recognize rapid prototyping and CAD .
The medics amongst you , if there are any , will recognize the first two .
But there will be nobody else in this room that understands all of those four words .
Taking the jargon out was very important to ensure that everyone in the team understood exactly what was meant when a particular phrase was used .
Our disciplinary conventions were funny as well .
We took a lot of horizontal slice images through me , produced those slices and then used those to build a CAD model .
And the very first CAD model we made , the surgeons were playing with the plastic model , couldn &apos;t quite figure it out .
And then we realized that it was actually a mirror image of the real aorta .
And it was a mirror image because in the real world we always look down on plans , plans of houses or streets or maps .
In the medical world they look up at plans .
So the horizontal images were all an inversion .
So one needs to be careful with disciplinary conventions .
Everyone needs to understand what is assumed and what is not assumed .
Institutional barriers were another serious headache in the project .
The Brompton Hospital was taken over by Imperial College &apos;s School of Medicine , and there are some seriously bad relationship problems between the two organizations .
I was working with Imperial and the Brompton , and this generated some serious problems with the project , really problems that shouldn &apos;t exist .
Research and ethics committee : If you want to do anything new in surgery , you have to get a license from your local research and ethics .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s the same in Poland .
There will be some form of equivalent , which licenses new types of surgery .
We didn &apos;t only have the bureaucratic problems associated with that , was also had professional jealousies .
There were people on the research and ethics committee who really didn &apos;t want to see John Pepper succeed again , because he &apos;s so successful .
And they made extra problems for us .
Bureaucratic problems : Ultimately when you have a new treatment you have to have a guidance note going out for all of the hospitals in the country .
In the U.K. we have the National Institute for Clinical Excellence , NICE .
You &apos;ll have an equivalent in Poland , no doubt .
We had to get past the NICE problem .
We now have a great clinical guidance out on the Net .
So any of the hospitals interested can come along , read the NICE report get in touch with us and then get doing it themselves .
Funding barriers : Another big area to be concerned with .
A big problem with understanding one of those perspectives : When we first approached one of the big U.K. charitable organizations that funds this kind of stuff , what they were looking at was essentially an engineering proposal .
They didn &apos;t understand it ; they were doctors , they were next to God .
It must be rubbish . They binned it .
So in the end I went to private investors and I just gave up on it .
But most R and D is going to be institutionally funded , by the Polish Academy of Sciences or the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council or whatever , and you need to get past those people .
Jargon is a huge problem when you &apos;re trying to work across disciplines , because in an engineering world , we all understand CAD and R.P. -- not in the medical world .
I suppose ultimately the funding bureaucrats have really got to get their act together .
They &apos;ve really got to start talking to each other , and they &apos;ve got to exercise a bit of imagination , if that &apos;s not too much to ask -- which it probably is .
I &apos;ve coined a phrase &quot; obstructive conservatism . &quot;
So many people in the medical world don &apos;t want to change , particularly not when some jumped-up engineer has come along with the answer .
They don &apos;t want to change .
They simply want to do whatever they &apos;ve done before .
And in fact , there are many surgeons in the U.K.
still waiting for one of our patients so that they can say , &quot; Ah , I told you that was no good . &quot;
We &apos;ve actually got 30 patients .
I &apos;m at seven and a half years .
We &apos;ve got 90 post-op patient years between us , and we haven &apos;t had a single problem .
And still , there are people in the U.K. saying , &quot; Yeah , that external aortic root , yeah , it &apos;ll never work , you know . &quot;
It really is a problem . It really is a problem .
I &apos;m sure everyone in this room has come across arrogance amongst medics , doctors , surgeons at some point .
The middle point is simply the way that the doctors protect themselves .
&quot; Yeah , well of course , I &apos;m looking after my patient . &quot;
I think it &apos;s not good , but there you are , that &apos;s my view .
Egos , of course , again , a huge problem If you &apos;re working in a multidisciplinary team , you &apos;ve got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt .
You &apos;ve got to express support for them .
Tom Treasure , professor of cardiothoracic surgery : incredible guy .
Dead easy to give him respect .
Him giving me respect ? Slightly different .
That &apos;s all the bad news .
The good news is the benefits are stonkingly huge .
Translate that one . I bet they can &apos;t .
When you have a group of people who have had a different professional training , a different professional experience , they not only have a different knowledge base , but they have a different perspective on everything .
And if you can bring those guys together and you can get them talking and understanding each other , the results can be spectacular .
You can find novel solutions , really novel solutions , that have never been looked at before very , very quickly and easily .
You can shortcut huge amounts of work simply by using the extended knowledge base you have .
And as a result , it &apos;s an entirely different use of the technology and the knowledge around you .
The result of all this is that you can get incredibly quick progress on incredibly small budgets .
I &apos;m so embarrassed at how cheap it was to get from my idea to me being implanted that I &apos;m not prepared to tell you what it cost .
Because I suspect there are absolutely standard surgical treatments probably in the USA which cost more for a one-off patient than the cost of us getting from my dream to my reality .
That &apos;s all I want to say , and I &apos;ve got three minutes left .
So Heather &apos;s going to like me .
If you have any questions , please come up and talk to me later on .
It would be a pleasure to speak with you . Many thanks .
Mark Bittman : What &apos;s wrong with what we eat
In this fiery and funny talk , New York Times food writer Mark Bittman weighs in on what &apos;s wrong with the way we eat now , and why it &apos;s putting the entire planet at risk .
I write about food . I write about cooking .
I take it quite seriously , but I &apos;m here to talk about something that &apos;s become very important to me in the last year or two .
It is about food , but it &apos;s not about cooking , per se .
I &apos;m going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow .
I &apos;m not a vegetarian -- this is the old Nixon line , right ?
But I still think that this -- -- may be this year &apos;s version of this .
Now , that is only a little bit hyperbolic .
And why do I say it ?
Because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined .
There was the bomb , and there &apos;s now .
And where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives , but whether , if we could see the Earth a century from now , we &apos;d recognize it .
It &apos;s a holocaust of a different kind , and hiding under our desks isn &apos;t going to help .
Start with the notion that global warming is not only real , but dangerous .
Since every scientist in the world now believes this , and even President Bush has seen the light , or pretends to , we can take this is a given .
Then hear this , please .
After energy production , livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases .
Nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production -- more than transportation .
Now , you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts , but methane is 20 times more poisonous than CO2 , and it &apos;s not just methane .
Livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation , air and water pollution , water shortages and loss of biodiversity .
There &apos;s more .
Like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people , but to animals .
But lists like this become kind of numbing , so let me just say this : if you &apos;re a progressive , if you &apos;re driving a Prius , or you &apos;re shopping green , or you &apos;re looking for organic , you should probably be a semi-vegetarian .
Now , I &apos;m no more anti-cattle than I am anti-atom , but it &apos;s all in the way we use these things .
There &apos;s another piece of the puzzle , which Ann Cooper talked about beautifully yesterday , and one you already know .
There &apos;s no question , none , that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes , heart disease , stroke , some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world .
And that &apos;s the direct result of eating a Western diet .
Our demand for meat , dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of Coke a day -- our demand for these things , not our need , our want , drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us .
And those calories are in foods that cause , not prevent , disease .
Now global warming was unforeseen .
We didn &apos;t know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility .
Maybe a few lung diseases here and there , but , you know , that &apos;s not such a big deal .
The current health crisis , however , is a little more the work of the evil empire .
We were told , we were assured , that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate , the healthier we &apos;d be .
No . Overconsumption of animals , and of course , junk food , is the problem , along with our paltry consumption of plants .
Now , there &apos;s no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here , but the evidence is that plants -- and I want to make this clear -- it &apos;s not the ingredients in plants , it &apos;s the plants .
It &apos;s not the beta-carotene , it &apos;s the carrot .
The evidence is very clear that plants promote health .
This evidence is overwhelming at this point .
You eat more plants , you eat less other stuff , you live longer .
Not bad .
But back to animals and junk food .
What do they have in common ?
One : we don &apos;t need either of them for health .
We don &apos;t need animal products , and we certainly don &apos;t need white bread or Coke .
Two : both have been marketed heavily , creating unnatural demand .
We &apos;re not born craving Whoppers or Skittles .
Three : their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and Earth-friendly diet .
Now , let &apos;s imagine a parallel .
Let &apos;s pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy , while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy , knowing all the while that the result would be pollution , war and rising costs .
Incredible , isn &apos;t it ?
Yet they do that .
And they do this here . It &apos;s the same deal .
The sad thing is , when it comes to diet , is that even when well-intentioned Feds try to do right by us , they fail .
Either they &apos;re outvoted by puppets of agribusiness , or they are puppets of agribusiness .
So , when the USDA finally acknowledged that it was plants , rather than animals , that made people healthy , they encouraged us , via their overly simplistic food pyramid , to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day , along with more carbs .
What they didn &apos;t tell us is that some carbs are better than others , and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food .
But industry lobbyists would never let that happen .
And guess what ?
Half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness .
So , instead of substituting plants for animals , our swollen appetites simply became larger , and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged .
So-called low-fat diets , so-called low-carb diets -- these are not solutions .
But with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local , or whether we &apos;re being nice to animals , the most important issues just aren &apos;t being addressed .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong .
I like animals , and I don &apos;t think it &apos;s just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches .
But there &apos;s no way to treat animals well , when you &apos;re killing 10 billion of them a year .
That &apos;s our number . 10 billion .
If you strung all of them -- chickens , cows , pigs and lambs -- to the moon , they &apos;d go there and back five times , there and back .
Now , my math &apos;s a little shaky , but this is pretty good , and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long , but you get the idea .
That &apos;s just the United States .
And with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease , kindness might just be a bit of a red herring .
Let &apos;s get the numbers of the animals we &apos;re killing for eating down , and then we &apos;ll worry about being nice to the ones that are left .
Another red herring might be exemplified by the word &quot; locavore , &quot; which was just named word of the year by the New Oxford American Dictionary .
Seriously .
And locavore , for those of you who don &apos;t know , is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in California , but for the rest of us it &apos;s a bit of a sad joke .
Between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision , you have two versions of how to improve our eating .
They both get it wrong , though .
The first at least is populist , and the second is elitist .
How we got to this place is the history of food in the United States .
And I &apos;m going to go through that , at least the last hundred years or so , very quickly right now .
A hundred years ago , guess what ?
Everyone was a locavore : even New York had pig farms nearby , and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion .
Every family had a cook , usually a mom .
And those moms bought and prepared food .
It was like your romantic vision of Europe .
Margarine didn &apos;t exist .
In fact , when margarine was invented , several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink , so we &apos;d all know that it was a fake .
There was no snack food , and until the &apos; 20s , until Clarence Birdseye came along , there was no frozen food .
There were no restaurant chains .
There were neighborhood restaurants run by local people , but none of them would think to open another one .
Eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic .
And fancy food was entirely French .
As an aside , those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide .
Back in those days , before even Julia , back in those days , there was no philosophy of food .
You just ate .
You didn &apos;t claim to be anything .
There was no marketing . There were no national brands .
Vitamins had not been invented .
There were no health claims , at least not federally sanctioned ones .
Fats , carbs , proteins -- they weren &apos;t bad or good , they were food .
You ate food .
Hardly anything contained more than one ingredient , because it was an ingredient .
The cornflake hadn &apos;t been invented .
The Pop-Tart , the Pringle , Cheez Whiz , none of that stuff .
Goldfish swam .
It &apos;s hard to imagine . People grew food , and they ate food .
And again , everyone ate local .
In New York , an orange was a common Christmas present , because it came all the way from Florida .
From the &apos; 30s on , road systems expanded , trucks took the place of railroads , fresh food began to travel more .
Oranges became common in New York .
The South and West became agricultural hubs , and in other parts of the country , suburbs took over farmland .
The effects of this are well known . They are everywhere .
And the death of family farms is part of this puzzle , as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato , even in summer .
Eventually , California produced too much food to ship fresh , so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods .
Thus arrived convenience .
It was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework .
Now , I know everybody over the age of , like 45 -- their mouths are watering at this point .
If we had a slide of Salisbury steak , even more so , right ?
But this may have cut down on housework , but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well .
Many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad .
I , for one -- and I &apos;m not kidding -- didn &apos;t eat real spinach or broccoli till I was 19 .
Who needed it though ? Meat was everywhere .
What could be easier , more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak ?
But by then cattle were already raised unnaturally .
Rather than spending their lives eating grass , for which their stomachs were designed , they were forced to eat soy and corn .
They have trouble digesting those grains , of course , but that wasn &apos;t a problem for producers .
New drugs kept them healthy .
Well , they kept them alive .
Healthy was another story .
Thanks to farm subsidies , the fine collaboration between agribusiness and Congress , soy , corn and cattle became king .
And chicken soon joined them on the throne .
It was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began , the thing we &apos;re only realizing just now .
Listen to this , between 1950 and 2000 , the world &apos;s population doubled .
Meat consumption increased five-fold .
Now , someone had to eat all that stuff , so we got fast food .
And this took care of the situation resoundingly .
Home cooking remained the norm , but its quality was down the tubes .
There were fewer meals with home-cooked breads , desserts and soups , because all of them could be bought at any store .
Not that they were any good , but they were there .
Most moms cooked like mine : a piece of broiled meat , a quickly made salad with bottled dressing , canned soup , canned fruit salad .
Maybe baked or mashed potatoes , or perhaps the stupidest food ever , Minute Rice .
For dessert , store-bought ice cream or cookies .
My mom is not here , so I can say this now .
This kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself .
It wasn &apos;t all bad .
By the &apos; 70s , forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients .
We tended gardens , we became interested in organic food , we knew or we were vegetarians .
We weren &apos;t all hippies , either .
Some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well .
Meanwhile , food production had become industrial . Industrial .
Perhaps because it was being produced rationally , as if it were plastic , food gained magical or poisonous powers , or both .
Many people became fat-phobic .
Others worshiped broccoli , as if it were God-like .
But mostly they didn &apos;t eat broccoli .
Instead they were sold on yogurt , yogurt being almost as good as broccoli .
Except , in reality , the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream .
Similarly , let &apos;s look at a granola bar .
You think that that might be healthy food , but in fact , if you look at the ingredient list , it &apos;s closer in form to a Snickers than it is to oatmeal .
Sadly , it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma , if not actually killed -- the beginning of the heyday of value-added food , which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it .
Think of the frozen chicken nugget .
The chicken is fed corn , and then its meat is ground up , and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder , and then it &apos;s fried in corn oil .
All you do is nuke it . What could be better ?
And zapped horribly , pathetically .
By the &apos; 70s , home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like McNuggets and Hot Pockets -- and we all have our favorites , actually -- made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home .
At the same time , masses of women were entering the workforce , and cooking simply wasn &apos;t important enough for men to share the burden .
So now , you &apos;ve got your pizza nights , you &apos;ve got your microwave nights , you &apos;ve got your grazing nights , you &apos;ve got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on .
Leading the way -- what &apos;s leading the way ?
Meat , junk food , cheese : the very stuff that will kill you .
So , now we clamor for organic food .
That &apos;s good .
And as evidence that things can actually change , you can now find organic food in supermarkets , and even in fast-food outlets .
But organic food isn &apos;t the answer either , at least not the way it &apos;s currently defined .
Let me pose you a question .
Can farm-raised salmon be organic , when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet , even if the feed itself is supposedly organic , and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens , swimming in their own filth ?
And if that salmon &apos;s from Chile , and it &apos;s killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles , whatever , dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere ?
I don &apos;t know .
Packed in Styrofoam , of course , before landing somewhere in the United States , and then being trucked a few hundred more miles .
This may be organic in letter , but it &apos;s surely not organic in spirit .
Now here is where we all meet .
The locavores , the organivores , the vegetarians , the vegans , the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food .
Even though we &apos;ve come to this from different points , we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food .
We need to start acting .
And this is not only an issue of social justice , as Ann Cooper said -- and , of course , she &apos;s completely right -- but it &apos;s also one of global survival .
Which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue , the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food .
As I said , 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production .
How much livestock do you need to produce this ?
70 percent of the agricultural land on Earth , 30 percent of the Earth &apos;s land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we &apos;ll eat .
And this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so .
And if the numbers coming in from China are anything like what they look like now , it &apos;s not going to be 40 years .
There is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do .
And I say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life .
The most common argument is that we need nutrients -- even though we eat , on average , twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed USDA recommends .
But listen : experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week .
What do you think we eat per day ? Half a pound .
But don &apos;t we need meat to be big and strong ?
Isn &apos;t meat eating essential to health ?
Won &apos;t a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless , sissy , liberals ?
Some of us might think that would be a good thing .
But , no , even if we were all steroid-filled football players , the answer is no .
In fact , there &apos;s no diet on Earth that meets basic nutritional needs that won &apos;t promote growth , and many will make you much healthier than ours does .
We don &apos;t eat animal products for sufficient nutrition , we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition , and it &apos;s killing us .
To suggest that in the interests of personal and human health Americans eat 50 percent less meat -- it &apos;s not enough of a cut , but it &apos;s a start .
It would seem absurd , but that &apos;s exactly what should happen , and what progressive people , forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating , along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants .
I &apos;ve been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years .
During that time , I &apos;ve eaten and recommended eating just about everything .
I &apos;ll never stop eating animals , I &apos;m sure , but I do think that for the benefit of everyone , the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly .
Ann Cooper &apos;s right .
The USDA is not our ally here .
We have to take matters into our own hands , not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone -- and that &apos;s the hard part -- but by improving our own .
And that happens to be quite easy .
Less meat , less junk , more plants .
It &apos;s a simple formula : eat food .
Eat real food .
We can continue to enjoy our food , and we continue to eat well , and we can eat even better .
We can continue the search for the ingredients we love , and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals .
We &apos;ll reduce not only calories , but our carbon footprint .
We can make food more important , not less , and save ourselves by doing so .
We have to choose that path .
Thank you .
David Hanson : Robots that &quot; show emotion &quot;
David Hanson &apos;s robot faces look and act like yours : They recognize and respond to emotion , and make expressions of their own . Here , an &quot; emotional &quot; live demo of the Einstein robot offers a peek at a future where robots truly mimic humans .
I &apos;m Dr. David Hanson , and I build robots with character .
And by that , I mean that I develop robots that are characters , but also robots that will eventually come to empathize with you .
So we &apos;re starting with a variety of technologies that have converged into these conversational character robots that can see faces , make eye contact with you , make a full range of facial expressions , understand speech and begin to model how you &apos;re feeling and who you are , and build a relationship with you .
I developed a series of technologies that allowed the robots to make more realistic facial expressions than previously achieved , on lower power , So , it &apos;s a full range of facial expressions simulating all the major muscles in the human face , running on very small batteries , extremely lightweight .
The materials that allowed the battery-operated facial expressions is a material that we call Frubber , and it actually has three major innovations in the material that allow this to happen .
One is hierarchical pores , and the other is a macro-molecular nanoscale porosity in the material .
There he &apos;s starting to walk .
This is at the Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology .
I built the head . They built the body .
So the goal here is to achieve sentience in machines , and not just sentience , but empathy .
We &apos;re working with the Machine Perception Laboratory at the U.C. San Diego .
They have this really remarkable facial expression technology that recognizes facial expressions , what facial expressions you &apos;re making .
It also recognizes where you &apos;re looking , your head orientation .
We &apos;re emulating all the major facial expressions , and then controlling it with the software that we call the Character Engine .
And here is a little bit of the technology that &apos;s involved in that .
In fact , right now -- plug it from here , and then plug it in here , and now let &apos;s see if it gets my facial expressions .
Okay . So I &apos;m smiling .
Now I &apos;m frowning .
And this is really heavily backlit .
Okay , here we go .
Oh , it &apos;s so sad .
Okay , so you smile , frowning .
So his perception of your emotional states is very important for machines to effectively become empathetic .
Machines are becoming devastatingly capable of things like killing . Right ?
Those machines have no place for empathy .
And there is billions of dollars being spent on that .
Character robotics could plant the seed for robots that actually have empathy .
So , if they achieve human level intelligence or , quite possibly , greater than human levels of intelligence , this could be the seeds of hope for our future .
So , we &apos;ve made 20 robots in the last eight years , during the course of getting my Ph.D.
And then I started Hanson Robotics , which has been developing these things for mass manufacturing .
This is one of our robots that we showed at Wired NextFest a couple of years ago .
And it sees multiple people in a scene , remembers where individual people are , and looks from person to person , remembering people .
So , we &apos;re involving two things .
One , the perception of people , and two , the natural interface , the natural form of the interface , so that it &apos;s more intuitive for you to interact with the robot .
You start to believe that it &apos;s alive and aware .
So one of my favorite projects was bringing all this stuff together in an artistic display of an android portrait of science-fiction writer Philip K. Dick , who wrote great works like , &quot; Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep ? &quot;
which was the basis of the movie &quot; Bladerunner . &quot;
In these stories , robots often think that they &apos;re human , and they sort of come to life .
So we put his writings , letters , his interviews , correspondences , into a huge database of thousands of pages , and then used some natural language processing to allow you to actually have a conversation with him .
And it was kind of spooky , because he would say these things that just sounded like they really understood you .
And this is one of the most exciting projects that we &apos;re developing , for friendly artificial intelligence , friendly machine intelligence .
And we &apos;re getting this mass-manufactured .
We specked it out to actually be doable with a very , very low-cost bill of materials , so that it can become a childhood companion for kids .
Interfacing with the Internet , it gets smarter over the years .
As artificial intelligence evolves , so does his intelligence .
Thank you so much . That &apos;s incredible .
Gever Tulley : Life lessons through tinkering
Gever Tulley uses engaging photos and footage to demonstrate the valuable lessons kids learn at his Tinkering School . When given tools , materials and guidance , these young imaginations run wild and creative problem-solving takes over to build unique boats , bridges and even a roller coaster !
This is the exact moment that I started creating something called Tinkering School .
Tinkering School is a place where kids can pick up sticks and hammers and other dangerous objects , and be trusted .
Trusted not to hurt themselves , and trusted not to hurt others .
Tinkering School doesn &apos;t follow a set curriculum , and there are no tests .
We &apos;re not trying to teach anybody any specific thing .
When the kids arrive they &apos;re confronted with lots of stuff : wood and nails and rope and wheels , and lots of tools , real tools .
It &apos;s a six-day immersive experience for the kids .
And within that context , we can offer the kids time -- something that seems in short supply in their over-scheduled lives .
Our goal is to ensure that they leave with a better sense of how to make things than when they arrived , and the deep internal realization that you can figure things out by fooling around .
Nothing ever turns out as planned ... ever .
And the kids soon learn that all projects go awry -- and become at ease with the idea that every step in a project is a step closer to sweet success , or gleeful calamity .
We start from doodles and sketches .
And sometimes we make real plans .
And sometimes we just start building .
Building is at the heart of the experience : hands on , deeply immersed and fully committed to the problem at hand .
Robin and I , acting as collaborators , keep the landscape of the projects tilted towards completion .
Success is in the doing , and failures are celebrated and analyzed .
Problems become puzzles and obstacles disappear .
When faced with particularly difficult setbacks or complexities , a really interesting behavior emerges : decoration .
Decoration of the unfinished project is a kind of conceptual incubation .
From these interludes come deep insights and amazing new approaches to solving the problems that had them frustrated just moments before .
All materials are available for use .
Even those mundane , hateful , plastic grocery bags can become a bridge stronger than anyone imagined .
And the things that they build amaze even themselves .
Three , two , one , go !
Gever Tulley : A rollercoaster built by seven-year-olds .
Yay !

Marco Tempest : Augmented reality , techno-magic
Using sleight-of-hand techniques and charming storytelling , illusionist Marco Tempest brings a jaunty stick figure to life onstage at TEDGlobal .
So magic is a very introverted field .
While scientists regularly publish their latest research , we magicians do not like to share our methods and secrets .
That &apos;s true even amongst peers .
But if you look at creative practice as a form of research , or art as a form of R &amp; amp ; D for humanity , then how could a cyber illusionist like myself share his research ?
Now my own speciality is combining digital technology and magic .
And about three years ago , I started an exercise in openness and inclusiveness by reaching out into the open-source software community to create new digital tools for magic -- tools that could eventually be shared with other artists to start them off further on in the process and to get them to the poetry faster .
Today , I &apos;d like to show you something which came out of these collaborations .
It &apos;s an augmented reality projection tracking and mapping system , or a digital storytelling tool .
Could we bring down the lights please ? Thank you .
So let &apos;s give this a try .
And I &apos;m going to use it to give you my take on the stuff of life .
Terribly sorry . I forgot the floor .
Wake up .
Hey .
Come on .
Please .
Come on .
Ah , sorry about that .
Forgot this .
Give it another try .
Okay .
He figured out the system .
Uh oh .
All right . Let &apos;s try this .
Come on .
Hey .
You heard her , go ahead .
Bye-bye .
Jackson Browne : A song inspired by the ocean
Jackson Browne plays a song he started writing last April aboard Mission Blue Voyage , the Sylvia Earle-inspired trip to brainstorm ways to save the ocean . &quot; If I could be anywhere , &quot; he sings , &quot; anywhere right now , I would be here . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Thank you .
Slide into the shimmering surface between two worlds . Standing at the center of time as it uncurls . Cutting through the veil of illusion . Moving beyond past conclusions . Wondering if all my doubt and confusion will clear . If I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere right now , I would want to be here . Searching for the future among the things we &apos;re throwing away . Trying to see the world through the junk we produce everyday . They say nothing lasts forever , but all the plastic ever made is still here . And no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear . If I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere in history , I would want to be here . The Romans , the Spanish the British , the Dutch , American exceptionalism , so out of touch . The folly of empire repeating its course , imposing its will and ruling by force on and on through time . But the world can &apos;t take it very much longer . We &apos;re not going to make it unless we &apos;re smarter and stronger . The world is going to shake itself free of our greed somehow . If I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere in time , if I could be anywhere and change things , it would have to be now . They say nothing last forever , but all the plastic ever made is still here . And no amount of closing our eyes will make it disappear . And the world can &apos;t take it very much longer . We &apos;re not going to make it unless we &apos;re smarter and stronger . The world &apos;s gonna shake itself free of our greed somehow . And the world can &apos;t take it , that you can see . If the oceans don &apos;t make it , neither will we . The world &apos;s gonna shake itself all the way free somehow . If I could be anywhere , if I could be anywhere in time , if I could be anywhere and change the outcome , it would have to be now . Thank you .

Majora Carter : Greening the ghetto
In an emotionally charged talk , MacArthur-winning activist Majora Carter details her fight for environmental justice in the South Bronx -- and shows how minority neighborhoods suffer most from flawed urban policy .
If you &apos;re here today -- and I &apos;m very happy that you are -- you &apos;ve all heard about how sustainable development will save us from ourselves . However , when we &apos;re not at TED , we are often told that a real sustainability policy agenda is just not feasible , especially in large , urban areas like New York City .
And that &apos;s because most people with decision-making powers , in both the public and the private sector , really don &apos;t feel as though they &apos;re in danger .
The reason why I &apos;m here today , in part , is because of a dog : an abandoned puppy I found back in the rain , back in 1998 .
She turned out to be a much bigger dog than I &apos;d anticipated .
When she came into my life , we were fighting against a huge waste facility planned for the East River waterfront , despite the fact that our small part of New York City already handled more than 40 percent of the entire city &apos;s commercial waste : a sewage treatment pelletizing plant , a sewage sludge plant , four power plants , the world &apos;s largest food distribution center , as well as other industries that bring more than 60,000 diesel truck trips to the area each week .
The area also has one of the lowest ratios of parks to people in the city .
So when I was contacted by the Parks Department about a $ 10,000 seed grant initiative seed grant initiative to help develop waterfront projects , I thought they were really well-meaning , but a bit naive .
I &apos;d lived in this area all my life , and you could not get to the river because of all the lovely facilities that I &apos;d mentioned earlier .
Then , while jogging with my dog one morning , she pulled me into what I thought was just another illegal dump .
There were weeds and piles of garbage and other stuff that I won &apos;t mention here , but she kept dragging me -- and lo and behold , at the end of that lot was the river .
I knew that this forgotten little street-end , abandoned like the dog that brought me there , was worth saving .
And I knew it would grow to become the proud beginnings of the community-led revitalization of the new South Bronx .
And just like my new dog , it was an idea that got bigger than I &apos;d imagined .
We garnered much support along the way .
And the Hunts Point Riverside Park became the first waterfront park that the South Bronx had had in more than 60 years .
We leveraged that $ 10,000 seed grant more than 300 times into a $ 3 million park .
And , in the fall , I &apos;m actually going to -- I exchange marriage vows with my beloved . Thank you very much .
That &apos;s him pressing my buttons back there , which he does all the time .
But those of us living in environmental justice communities are the canary in the coalmine . We feel the problems right now , and have for some time .
Environmental justice , for those of you who may not be familiar with the term , goes something like this : no community should be saddled with more environmental burdens and less environmental benefits than any other .
Unfortunately , race and class are extremely reliable indicators as to where one might find the good stuff , like parks and trees , and where one might find the bad stuff , like power plants and waste facilities .
As a black person in America , I am twice as likely as a white person to live in an area where air pollution poses the greatest risk to my health .
I am five times more likely to live within walking distance of a power plant or chemical facility -- which I do .
These land-use decisions created the hostile conditions that lead to problems like obesity , diabetes and asthma .
Why would someone leave their home to go for a brisk walk in a toxic neighborhood ?
Our 27 percent obesity rate is high , even for this country , and diabetes comes with it .
One out of four South Bronx children has asthma .
Our asthma hospitalization rate is seven times higher than the national average .
These impacts are coming everyone &apos;s way .
And we all pay dearly for solid waste costs , health problems associated with pollution and more odiously , the cost of imprisoning our young black and Latino men , who possess untold amounts of untapped potential .
50 percent of our residents live at or below the poverty line .
25 percent of us are unemployed . Low-income citizens often use emergency room visits as primary care .
This comes at a high cost to taxpayers and produces no proportional benefits .
Poor people are not only still poor ; they are still unhealthy .
Fortunately , there are many people like me who are striving for solutions that won &apos;t compromise the lives of low-income communities of color in the short term , and won &apos;t destroy us all in the long term .
None of us want that , and we all have that in common . So what else do we have in common ?
Well , first of all , we &apos;re all incredibly good-looking -- -- graduated high school , college , post-graduate degrees , traveled to interesting places , didn &apos;t have kids in your early teens , financially stable , never been imprisoned . OK .
Good .
But , besides being a black woman , I am different from most of you in some other ways .
I watched nearly half of the buildings in my neighborhood burn down .
My big brother Lenny fought in Vietnam , only to be gunned down a few blocks from our home .
Jesus . I grew up with a crack house across the street .
Yeah , I &apos;m a poor black child from the ghetto .
These things make me different from you .
But the things we have in common set me apart from most of the people in my community , and I am in between these two worlds , with enough of my heart to fight for justice in the other .
So how did things get so different for us ?
In the late &apos; 40s , my dad -- a Pullman porter , son of a slave -- bought a house in the Hunts Point section of the South Bronx , and a few years later he married my mom .
At the time , the community was a mostly white , working-class neighborhood .
My dad was not alone .
And as others like him pursued their own version of the American dream , white flight became common in the South Bronx and in many cities around the country .
Red-lining was used by banks , wherein certain sections of the city , including ours , were deemed off-limits to any sort of investment .
Many landlords believed it was more profitable to torch their buildings and collect insurance money rather than to sell under those conditions -- dead or injured former tenants notwithstanding .
Hunts Point was formerly a walk-to-work community , but now residents had neither work nor home to walk to .
A national highway construction boom was added to our problems .
In New York State , Robert Moses spearheaded an aggressive highway expansion campaign .
One of its primary goals was to make it easier for residents of wealthy communities in Westchester County to go to Manhattan .
The South Bronx , which lies in between , did not stand a chance .
Residents were often given less than a month &apos;s notice before their buildings were razed .
600,000 people were displaced .
The common perception was that only pimps and pushers and prostitutes were from the South Bronx .
And if you are told from your earliest days that nothing good is going to come from your community , that is bad and ugly , how could it not reflect on you ?
So now , my family &apos;s property was worthless , save for that it was our home and all we had .
And luckily for me , that home and the love inside of it , along with help from teachers , mentors and friends along the way , was enough .
Now , why is this story important ?
Because from a planning perspective , economic degradation begets environmental degradation , which begets social degradation .
The disinvestment that began in the 1960s set the stage for all the environmental injustices that were to come .
Antiquated zoning and land-use regulations are still used to this day to continue putting polluting facilities in my neighborhood .
Are these factors taken into consideration when land-use policy is decided ?
What costs are associated with these decisions ? And who pays ?
Who profits ? Does anything justify what the local community goes through ?
This was &quot; planning &quot; -- in quotes -- that did not have our best interests in mind .
Once we realized that , we decided it was time to do our own planning .
That small park I told you about earlier was the first stage of building a greenway movement in the South Bronx .
I wrote a one-and-a-quarter-million dollar federal transportation grant to design the plan for a waterfront esplanade with dedicated on-street bike paths .
Physical improvements help inform public policy regarding traffic safety , the placement of the waste and other facilities , which , if done properly , don &apos;t compromise a community &apos;s quality of life .
They provide opportunities to be more physically active , as well as local economic development .
Think bike shops , juice stands .
We secured 20 million dollars to build first-phase projects .
This is Lafayette Avenue -- and as redesigned by Matthews-Nielsen landscape architects .
And once this path is constructed , it &apos;ll connect the South Bronx with more than 400 acres of Randall &apos;s Island Park .
Right now we &apos;re separated by about 25 feet of water , but this link will change that .
As we nurture the natural environment , its abundance will give us back even more .
We run a project called the Bronx Ecological Stewardship Training , which provides job training in the fields of ecological restorations , so that folks from our community have the skills to compete for these well-paying jobs .
Little by little , we &apos;re seeding the area with green collar jobs -- then the people that have both a financial and personal stake in their environment .
The Sheridan Expressway is an underutilized relic of the Robert Moses era , built with no regard for the neighborhoods that were divided by it .
Even during rush hour , it goes virtually unused .
The community created an alternative transportation plan that allows for the removal of the highway .
We have the opportunity now to bring together all the stakeholders to re-envision how this 28 acres can be better utilized for parkland , affordable housing and local economic development .
We also built the city &apos;s -- New York City &apos;s first green and cool roof demonstration project on top of our offices .
Cool roofs are highly reflective surfaces that don &apos;t absorb solar heat and pass it on to the building or atmosphere .
Green roofs are soil and living plants .
Both can be used instead of petroleum-based roofing materials that absorb heat , contribute to urban &quot; heat island &quot; effect and degrade under the sun , which we in turn breathe . Green roofs also retain up to 75 percent of rainfall , so they reduce a city &apos;s need to fund costly end-of-pipe solutions -- which , incidentally , are often located in environmental justice communities like mine .
And they provide habitats for our little friends !
So -- -- so cool !
Anyway , the demonstration project is a springboard for our own green roof installation business , bringing jobs and sustainable economic activity to the South Bronx .
I like that , too .
Anyway , I know Chris told us not to do pitches up here , but since I have all of your attention : we need investors . End of pitch .
It &apos;s better to ask for forgiveness than permission .
Anyway -- OK . Katrina . Prior to Katrina , the South Bronx and New Orleans &apos; Ninth Ward had a lot in common . Both were largely populated by poor people of color , both hotbeds of cultural innovation : think hip-hop and jazz .
Both are waterfront communities that host both industries and residents in close proximity of one another .
In the post-Katrina era , we have still more in common .
We &apos;re at best ignored and maligned and abused , at worst , by negligent regulatory agencies , pernicious zoning and lax governmental accountability .
Neither the destruction of the Ninth Ward nor the South Bronx was inevitable .
But we have emerged with valuable lessons about how to dig ourselves out .
We are more than simply national symbols of urban blight .
Or problems to be solved by empty campaign promises of presidents come and gone .
Now will we let the Gulf Coast languish for a decade or two like the South Bronx did ?
Or will we take proactive steps and learn from the homegrown resource of grassroots activists that have been born of desperation in communities like mine ?
Now listen , I do not expect individuals , corporations or government to make the world a better place because it is right or moral .
This presentation today only represents some of what I &apos;ve been through , like a tiny little bit . You &apos;ve no clue .
But I &apos;ll tell you later if you want to know .
But -- I know it &apos;s the bottom line , or one &apos;s perception of it , that motivates people in the end .
I &apos;m interested in what I like to call the &quot; triple bottom line &quot; that sustainable development can produce .
Developments that have the potential to create positive returns for all concerned : the developers , government and the community where these projects go up .
At present , that &apos;s not happening in New York City .
And we are operating with a comprehensive urban planning deficit .
A parade of government subsidies is going to proposed big-box and stadium developments in the South Bronx , but there is scant coordination between city agencies on how to deal with the cumulative effects of increased traffic , pollution , solid waste and the impacts on open space . And their approaches to local economic and job development are so lame it &apos;s not even funny .
Because on top of that , the world &apos;s richest sports team is replacing the House That Ruth Built by destroying two well-loved community parks .
Now , we &apos;ll have even less than that stat I told you about earlier .
And although less than 25 percent of South Bronx residents own cars , these projects include thousands of new parking spaces , yet zip in terms of mass public transit .
Now , what &apos;s missing from the larger debate is a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis between not fixing an unhealthy , environmentally challenged community , versus incorporating structural , sustainable changes .
My agency is working closely with Columbia University and others to shine a light on these issues .
Now let &apos;s get this straight . I am not anti-development .
Ours is a city , not a wilderness preserve . And I &apos;ve embraced my inner capitalist .
You probably all have it , and if you haven &apos;t , you need to .
So I don &apos;t have a problem with developers making money .
There &apos;s enough precedent out there to show that a sustainable , community-friendly development can still make a fortune .
Fellow TEDsters Bill McDonough and Amory Lovins -- both heroes of mine by the way -- have shown that you can actually do that .
I do have a problem with developments that hyper-exploit politically vulnerable communities for profit .
That it continues is a shame upon us all , because we are all responsible for the future that we create .
But one of the things I do to remind myself of greater possibilities is to learn from visionaries in other cities .
This is my version of globalization .
Let &apos;s take Bogota . Poor , Latino , surrounded by runaway gun violence and drug trafficking : a reputation not unlike that of the South Bronx .
However , this city was blessed in the late 1990s with a highly influential mayor named Enrique Penalosa .
He looked at the demographics .
Few Bogatanos own cars , yet a huge portion of the city &apos;s resources was dedicated to serving them .
If you &apos;re a mayor , you can do something about that .
His administration narrowed key municipal thoroughfares from five lanes to three , outlawed parking on those streets , expanded pedestrian walkways and bike lanes , created public plazas , created one of the most efficient bus mass-transit systems in the entire world .
For his brilliant efforts , he was nearly impeached .
But as people began to see that they were being put first on issues reflecting their day-to-day lives , incredible things happened .
People stopped littering ; crime rates dropped -- because the streets were alive with people .
His administration attacked several typical urban problems at one time , and on a third-world budget at that .
We have no excuse in this country . I &apos;m sorry .
But the bottom line is : their people-first agenda was not meant to penalize those who could actually afford cars , but rather to provide opportunities for all Bogatanos to participate in the city &apos;s resurgence . That development should not come at the expense of the majority of the population is still considered a radical idea here in the US .
But Bogota &apos;s example has the power to change that .
You , however , are blessed with the gift of influence .
That &apos;s why you &apos;re here and why you value the information we exchange .
Use your influence in support of comprehensive sustainable change everywhere .
Don &apos;t just talk about it at TED . This is a nationwide policy agenda I &apos;m trying to build , and as you all know , politics are personal .
Help me make green the new black . Help me make sustainability sexy .
Make it a part of your dinner and cocktail conversations .
Help me fight for environmental and economic justice .
Support investments with a triple-bottom-line return .
Help me democratize sustainability by bringing everyone to the table and insisting that comprehensive planning can be addressed everywhere .
Oh good , glad I have a little more time !
Listen -- when I spoke to Mr. Gore the other day after breakfast , I asked him how environmental justice activists were going to be included in his new marketing strategy .
His response was a grant program .
I don &apos;t think he understood that I wasn &apos;t asking for funding .
I was making him an offer .
What troubled me was that this top-down approach is still around .
Now , don &apos;t get me wrong , we need money .
But grassroots groups are needed at the table during the decision-making process .
Of the 90 percent of the energy that Mr. Gore reminded us that we waste every day , don &apos;t add wasting our energy , intelligence and hard-earned experience to that count .
I have come from so far to meet you like this .
Please don &apos;t waste me . By working together , we can become one of those small , rapidly growing groups of individuals who actually have the audacity and courage to believe that we actually can change the world .
We might have come to this conference from very , very different stations in life , but believe me , we all share one incredibly powerful thing : we have nothing to lose and everything to gain .
Ciao bellos !
Kary Mullis : A next-gen cure for killer infections
Drug-resistant bacteria kills , even in top hospitals . But now tough infections like staph and anthrax may be in for a surprise . Nobel-winning chemist Kary Mullis , who watched a friend die when powerful antibiotics failed , unveils a radical new cure that shows extraordinary promise .
So it was about four years ago , five years ago , I was sitting on a stage in Philadelphia , I think it was , with a bag similar to this .
And I was pulling a molecule out of this bag .
And I was saying , you don &apos;t know this molecule really well , but your body knows it extremely well .
And I was thinking that your body hated it , at the time , because we are very immune to this . This is called alpha-gal epitope .
And the fact that pig heart valves have lots of these on them is the reason that you can &apos;t transplant a pig heart valve into a person easily .
Actually our body doesn &apos;t hate these .
Our body loves these . It eats them .
I mean , the cells in our immune system are always hungry .
And if an antibody is stuck to one of these things on the cell , it means &quot; that &apos;s food . &quot;
Now , I was thinking about that and I said , you know , we &apos;ve got this immune response to this ridiculous molecule that we don &apos;t make , and we see it a lot in other animals and stuff .
But I said we can &apos;t get rid of it , because all the people who tried to transplant heart valves found out you can &apos;t get rid of that immunity .
And I said , why don &apos;t you use that ?
What if I could stick this molecule , slap it onto a bacteria that was pathogenic to me , that had just invaded my lungs ?
I mean I could immediately tap into an immune response that was already there , where it was not going to take five or six days to develop it -- it was going to immediately attack whatever this thing was on .
It was kind of like the same thing that happens when you , like when you &apos;re getting stopped for a traffic ticket in L.A. , and the cop drops a bag of marijuana in the back of your car , and then charges you for possession of marijuana .
It &apos;s like this very fast , very efficient way to get people off the street .
So you can take a bacteria that really doesn &apos;t make these things at all , and if you could clamp these on it really well you have it taken off the street .
And for certain bacteria we don &apos;t have really efficient ways to do that anymore .
Our antibiotics are running out .
And , I mean , the world apparently is running out too .
So probably it doesn &apos;t matter 50 years from now -- streptococcus and stuff like that will be rampant -- because we won &apos;t be here . But if we are -- we &apos;re going to need something to do with the bacteria .
So I started working with this thing , with a bunch of collaborators .
And trying to attach this to things that were themselves attached to certain specific target zones , bacteria that we don &apos;t like .
And I feel now like George Bush .
It &apos;s like &quot; mission accomplished . &quot;
So I might be doing something dumb , just like he was doing at the time .
But basically what I was talking about there we &apos;ve now gotten to work .
And it &apos;s killing bacteria . It &apos;s eating them .
This thing can be stuck , like that little green triangle up there , sort of symbolizing this right now .
You can stick this to something called a DNA aptamer .
And that DNA aptamer will attach specifically to a target that you have selected for it .
So you can find a little feature on a bacterium that you don &apos;t like , like Staphylococcus -- I don &apos;t like it in particular , because it killed a professor friend of mine last year .
It doesn &apos;t respond to antibiotics . So I don &apos;t like it .
And I &apos;m making an aptamer that will have this attached to it .
That will know how to find Staph when it &apos;s in your body , and will alert your immune system to go after it .
Here &apos;s what happened . See that line on the very top with the little dots ?
That &apos;s a bunch of mice that had been poisoned by our scientist friends down in Texas , at Brooks Air Base , with anthrax .
And they had also been treated with a drug that we made that would attack anthrax in particular , and direct your immune system to it .
You &apos;ll notice they all lived , the ones on the top line -- that &apos;s a 100 percent survival rate .
And they actually lived another 14 days , or 28 when we finally killed them , and took them apart and figured out what went wrong .
Why did they not die ?
And they didn &apos;t die because they didn &apos;t have anthrax anymore .
So we did it . Okay ?
Mission accomplished !
Hans Rosling : Global population growth , box by box
The world &apos;s population will grow to 9 billion over the next 50 years -- and only by raising the living standards of the poorest can we check population growth . This is the paradoxical answer that Hans Rosling unveils at TED @ Cannes using colorful new data display technology .
I still remember the day in school when our teacher told us that the world population had become three billion people , and that was in 1960 .
I &apos;m going to talk now about how world population has changed from that year and into the future , but I will not use digital technology , as I &apos;ve done during my first five TEDTalks .
Instead , I have progressed , and I am , today , launching a brand new analog teaching technology that I picked up from IKE this box .
This box contains one billion people .
And our teacher told us that the industrialized world , 1960 , had one billion people .
In the developing world , she said , they had two billion people .
And they lived away then .
There was a big gap between the one billion in the industrialized world and the two billion in the developing world .
In the industrialized world , people were healthy , educated , rich , and they had small families .
And their aspiration was to buy a car .
And in 1960 , all Swedes were saving to try to buy a Volvo like this .
This was the economic level at which Sweden was .
But in contrast to this , in the developing world , far away , the aspiration of the average family there was to have food for the day .
They were saving to be able to buy a pair of shoes .
There was an enormous gap in the world when I grew up .
And this gap between the West and the rest has created a mindset of the world , which we still use linguistically when we talk about &quot; the West &quot; and &quot; the Developing World . &quot;
But the world has changed , and it &apos;s overdue to upgrade that mindset and that taxonomy of the world , and to understand it .
And that &apos;s what I &apos;m going to show you , because since 1960 what has happened in the world up to 2010 is that a staggering four billion people have been added to the world population .
Just look how many .
The world population has doubled since I went to school .
And of course , there &apos;s been economic growth in the West .
A lot of companies have happened to grow the economy , so the Western population moved over to here .
And now their aspiration is not only to have a car .
Now they want to have a holiday on a very remote destination and they want to fly .
So this is where they are today .
And the most successful of the developing countries , they have moved on , you know , and they have become emerging economies , we call them .
They are now buying cars .
And what happened a month ago was that the Chinese company , Geely , they acquired the Volvo company , and then finally the Swedes understood that something big had happened in the world .
So there they are .
And the tragedy is that the two billion over here that is struggling for food and shoes , they are still almost as poor as they were 50 years ago .
The new thing is that we have the biggest pile of billions , the three billions here , which are also becoming emerging economies , because they are quite healthy , relatively well-educated , and they already also have two to three children per woman , as those &#91; richer also &#93; have .
And their aspiration now is , of course , to buy a bicycle , and then later on they would like to have a motorbike also .
But this is the world we have today , no longer any gap .
But the distance from the poorest here , the very poorest , to the very richest over here is wider than ever .
But there is a continuous world from walking , biking , driving , flying -- there are people on all levels , and most people tend to be somewhere in the middle .
This is the new world we have today in 2010 .
And what will happen in the future ?
Well , I &apos;m going to project into 2050 .
I was in Shanghai recently , and I listened to what &apos;s happening in China , and it &apos;s pretty sure that they will catch up , just as Japan did .
All the projections &#91; say that &#93; this one &#91; billion &#93; will &#91; only &#93; grow with one to two or three percent .
&#91; But this second &#93; grows with seven , eight percent , and then they will end up here .
They will start flying .
And these lower or middle income countries , the emerging income countries , they will also forge forwards economically .
And if , but only if , we invest in the right green technology -- so that we can avoid severe climate change , and energy can still be relatively cheap -- then they will move all the way up here .
And they will start to buy electric cars .
This is what we will find there .
So what about the poorest two billion ?
What about the poorest two billion here ?
Will they move on ?
Well , here population &#91; growth &#93; comes in because there &#91; among emerging economies &#93; we already have two to three children per woman , family planning is widely used , and population growth is coming to an end .
Here &#91; among the poorest &#93; , population is growing .
So these &#91; poorest &#93; two billion will , in the next decades , increase to three billion , and they will thereafter increase to four billion .
There is nothing -- but a nuclear war of a kind we &apos;ve never seen -- that can stop this &#91; growth &#93; from happening .
Because we already have this &#91; growth &#93; in process .
But if , and only if , &#91; the poorest &#93; get out of poverty , they get education , they get improved child survival , they can buy a bicycle and a cell phone and come &#91; to live &#93; here , then population growth will stop in 2050 .
We cannot have people on this level looking for food and shoes because then we get continued population growth .
And let me show you why by converting back to the old-time digital technology .
Here I have on the screen my country bubbles .
Every bubble is a country . The size is population .
The colors show the continent .
The yellow on there is the Americas ; dark blue is Africa ; brown is Europe ; green is the Middle East and this light blue is South Asia .
That &apos;s India and this is China . Size is population .
Here I have children per woman : two children , four children , six children , eight children -- big families , small families .
The year is 1960 .
And down here , child survival , the percentage of children surviving childhood up to starting school : 60 percent , 70 percent , 80 percent , 90 , and almost 100 percent , as we have today in the wealthiest and healthiest countries .
But look , this is the world my teacher talked about in 1960 : one billion Western world here -- high child-survival , small families -- and all the rest , the rainbow of developing countries , with very large families and poor child survival .
What has happened ? I start the world . Here we go .
Can you see , as the years pass by , child survival is increasing ?
They get soap , hygiene , education , vaccination , penicillin and then family planning . Family size is decreasing .
&#91; When &#93; they get up to 90-percent child survival , then families decrease , and most of the Arab countries in the Middle East is falling down there &#91; to small families &#93; .
Look , Bangladesh catching up with India .
The whole emerging world joins the Western world with good child survival and small family size , but we still have the poorest billion .
Can you see the poorest billion , those &#91; two &#93; boxes I had over here ?
They are still up here .
And they still have a child survival of only 70 to 80 percent , meaning that if you have six children born , there will be at least four who survive to the next generation .
And the population will double in one generation .
So the only way of really getting world population &#91; growth &#93; to stop is to continue to improve child survival to 90 percent .
That &apos;s why investments by Gates Foundation , UNICEF and aid organizations , together with national government in the poorest countries , are so good ; because they are actually helping us to reach a sustainable population size of the world .
We can stop at nine billion if we do the right things .
Child survival is the new green .
It &apos;s only by child survival that we will stop population growth .
And will it happen ?
Well , I &apos;m not an optimist , neither am I a pessimist .
I &apos;m a very serious &quot; possibilist . &quot;
It &apos;s a new category where we take emotion apart , and we just work analytically with the world .
It can be done .
We can have a much more just world .
With green technology and with investments to alleviate poverty , and global governance , the world can become like this .
And look at the position of the old West .
Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
This will not happen &#91; again &#93; .
The role of the old West in the new world is to become the foundation of the modern world -- nothing more , nothing less .
But it &apos;s a very important role .
Do it well and get used to it .
Thank you very much .
Joe Sabia : The technology of storytelling
iPad storyteller Joe Sabia introduces us to Lothar Meggendorfer , who created a bold technology for storytelling : the pop-up book . Sabia shows how new technology has always helped us tell our own stories , from the walls of caves to his own onstage iPad .
Ladies and gentlemen , gather around .
I would love to share with you a story .
Once upon a time in 19th century Germany , there was the book .
Now during this time , the book was the king of storytelling .
It was venerable .
It was ubiquitous .
But it was a little bit boring .
Because in its 400 years of existence , storytellers never evolved the book as a storytelling device .
But then one author arrived , and he changed the game forever .
His name was Lothar , Lothar Meggendorfer .
Lothar Meggendorfer put his foot down , and he said , &quot; Genug ist genug ! &quot;
He grabbed his pen , he snatched his scissors .
This man refused to fold to the conventions of normalcy and just decided to fold .
History would know Lothar Meggendorfer as -- who else ? -- the world &apos;s first true inventor of the children &apos;s pop-up book .
For this delight and for this wonder , people rejoiced .
They were happy because the story survived , and that the world would keep on spinning .
Lothar Meggendorfer wasn &apos;t the first to evolve the way a story was told , and he certainly wasn &apos;t the last .
Whether storytellers realized it or not , they were channeling Meggendorfer &apos;s spirit when they moved opera to vaudville , radio news to radio theater , film to film in motion to film in sound , color , 3D , on VHS and on DVD .
There seemed to be no cure for this Meggendorferitis .
And things got a lot more fun when the Internet came around .
Because , not only could people broadcast their stories throughout the world , but they could do so using what seemed to be an infinite amount of devices .
For example , one company would tell a story of love through its very own search engine .
One Taiwanese production studio would interpret American politics in 3D .
And one man would tell the stories of his father by using a platform called Twitter to communicate the excrement his father would gesticulate .
And after all this , everyone paused ; they took a step back .
They realized that , in 6,000 years of storytelling , they &apos;ve gone from depicting hunting on cave walls to depicting Shakespeare on Facebook walls .
And this was a cause for celebration .
The art of storytelling has remained unchanged .
And for the most part , the stories are recycled .
But the way that humans tell the stories has always evolved with pure , consistent novelty .
And they remembered a man , one amazing German , every time a new storytelling device popped up next .
And for that , the audience -- the lovely , beautiful audience -- would live happily ever after .
Jeff Smith : Lessons in business ... from prison
Jeff Smith spent a year in prison . But what he discovered inside wasn &apos;t what he expected -- he saw in his fellow inmates boundless ingenuity and business savvy . He asks : Why don &apos;t we tap this entrepreneurial potential to help ex-prisoners contribute to society once they &apos;re back outside ?
B.J. was one of many fellow inmates who had big plans for the future .
He had a vision . When he got out , he was going to leave the dope game for good and fly straight , and he was actually working on merging his two passions into one vision .
He &apos;d spent 10,000 dollars to buy a website that exclusively featured women having sex on top of or inside of luxury sports cars .
It was my first week in federal prison , and I was learning quickly that it wasn &apos;t what you see on TV .
In fact , it was teeming with smart , ambitious men whose business instincts were in many cases as sharp as those of the CEOs who had wined and dined me six months earlier when I was a rising star in the Missouri Senate .
Now , 95 percent of the guys that I was locked up with had been drug dealers on the outside , but when they talked about what they did , they talked about it in a different jargon , but the business concepts that they talked about weren &apos;t unlike those that you &apos;d learn in a first year MBA class at Wharton : promotional incentives , you never charge a first-time user , focus-grouping new product launches , territorial expansion .
But they didn &apos;t spend a lot of time reliving the glory days .
For the most part , everyone was just trying to survive .
It &apos;s a lot harder than you might think .
Contrary to what most people think , people don &apos;t pay , taxpayers don &apos;t pay , for your life when you &apos;re in prison . You &apos;ve got to pay for your own life .
You &apos;ve got to pay for your soap , your deodorant , toothbrush , toothpaste , all of it .
And it &apos;s hard for a couple of reasons .
First , everything &apos;s marked up 30 to 50 percent from what you &apos;d pay on the street , and second , you don &apos;t make a lot of money .
I unloaded trucks . That was my full-time job , unloading trucks at a food warehouse , for $ 5.25 , not an hour , but per month .
So how do you survive ?
Well , you learn to hustle , all kinds of hustles .
There &apos;s legal hustles .
You pay everything in stamps . Those are the currency .
You charge another inmate to clean his cell .
There &apos;s sort of illegal hustles , like you run a barbershop out of your cell .
There &apos;s pretty illegal hustles : You run a tattoo parlor out of your own cell .
And there &apos;s very illegal hustles , which you smuggle in , you get smuggled in , drugs , pornography , cell phones , and just as in the outer world , there &apos;s a risk-reward tradeoff , so the riskier the enterprise , the more profitable it can potentially be .
You want a cigarette in prison ? Three to five dollars .
You want an old-fashioned cell phone that you flip open and is about as big as your head ? Three hundred bucks .
You want a dirty magazine ?
Well , it can be as much as 1,000 dollars .
So as you can probably tell , one of the defining aspects of prison life is ingenuity .
Whether it was concocting delicious meals from stolen scraps from the warehouse , sculpting people &apos;s hair with toenail clippers , or constructing weights from boulders in laundry bags tied on to tree limbs , prisoners learn how to make do with less , and many of them want to take this ingenuity that they &apos;ve learned to the outside and start restaurants , barber shops , personal training businesses .
But there &apos;s no training , nothing to prepare them for that , no rehabilitation at all in prison , no one to help them write a business plan , figure out a way to translate the business concepts they intuitively grasp into legal enterprises , no access to the Internet , even .
And then , when they come out , most states don &apos;t even have a law prohibiting employers from discriminating against people with a background .
So none of us should be surprised that two out of three ex-offenders re-offend within five years .
Look , I lied to the Feds . I lost a year of my life from it .
But when I came out , I vowed that I was going to do whatever I could to make sure that guys like the ones I was locked up with didn &apos;t have to waste any more of their life than they already had .
So I hope that you &apos;ll think about helping in some way .
The best thing we can do is figure out ways to nurture the entrepreneurial spirit and the tremendous untapped potential in our prisons , because if we don &apos;t , they &apos;re not going to learn any new skills that &apos;s going to help them , and they &apos;ll be right back .
All they &apos;ll learn on the inside is new hustles .
Thank you .
Alex Laskey : How behavioral science can lower your energy bill
What &apos;s a proven way to lower your energy costs ? Would you believe : learning what your neighbor pays . Alex Laskey shows how a quirk of human behavior can make us all better , wiser energy users , with lower bills to prove it .
How many of you have checked your email today ?
Come on , raise your hands .
How many of you are checking it right now ?
And how about finances ? Anybody check that today ?
Credit card , investment account ?
How about this week ?
Now , how about your household energy use ?
Anybody check that today ?
This week ? Last week ?
A few energy geeks spread out across the room .
It &apos;s good to see you guys .
But the rest of us -- this is a room filled with people who are passionate about the future of this planet , and even we aren &apos;t paying attention to the energy use that &apos;s driving climate change .
The woman in the photo with me is Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
Harriet &apos;s paying attention to her energy use , and she is decidedly not an energy geek .
This is the story of how Harriet came to pay attention .
This is coal , the most common source of electricity on the planet , and there &apos;s enough energy in this coal to light this bulb for more than a year .
But unfortunately , between here and here , most of that energy is lost to things like transmission leakage and heat .
In fact , only 10 percent ends up as light .
So this coal will last a little bit more than a month .
If you wanted to light this bulb for a year , you &apos;d need this much coal .
The bad news here is that , for every unit of energy we use , we waste nine .
That means there &apos;s good news , because for every unit of energy we save , we save the other nine .
So the question is , how can we get the people in this room and across the globe to start paying attention to the energy we &apos;re using , and start wasting less of it ?
The answer comes from a behavioral science experiment that was run one hot summer , 10 years ago , and only 90 miles from here , in San Marcos , California .
Graduate students put signs on every door in a neighborhood , asking people to turn off their air conditioning and turn on their fans .
One quarter of the homes received a message that said , did you know you could save 54 dollars a month this summer ?
Turn off your air conditioning , turn on your fans .
Another group got an environmental message .
And still a third group got a message about being good citizens , preventing blackouts .
Most people guessed that money-saving message would work best of all .
In fact , none of these messages worked .
They had zero impact on energy consumption .
It was as if the grad students hadn &apos;t shown up at all .
But there was a fourth message , and this message simply said , &quot; When surveyed , 77 percent of your neighbors said that they turned off their air conditioning and turned on their fans .
Please join them . Turn off your air conditioning and turn on your fans . &quot;
And wouldn &apos;t you know it , they did .
The people who received this message showed a marked decrease in energy consumption simply by being told what their neighbors were doing .
So what does this tell us ?
Well , if something is inconvenient , even if we believe in it , moral suasion , financial incentives , don &apos;t do much to move us -- but social pressure , that &apos;s powerful stuff .
And harnessed correctly , it can be a powerful force for good .
In fact , it already is .
Inspired by this insight , my friend Dan Yates and I started a company called Opower .
We built software and partnered with utility companies who wanted to help their customers save energy .
We deliver personalized home energy reports that show people how their consumption compares to their neighbors in similar-sized homes .
Just like those effective door hangers , we have people comparing themselves to their neighbors , and then we give everyone targeted recommendations to help them save .
We started with paper , we moved to a mobile application , web , and now even a controllable thermostat , and for the last five years we &apos;ve been running the largest behavioral science experiment in the world .
And it &apos;s working .
Ordinary homeowners and renters have saved more than 250 million dollars on their energy bills , and we &apos;re just getting started .
This year alone , in partnership with more than 80 utilities in six countries , we &apos;re going to generate another two terawatt hours of electricity savings .
Now , the energy geeks in the room know two terawatt hours , but for the rest of us , two terawatt hours is more than enough energy to power every home in St. Louis and Salt Lake City combined for more than a year .
Two terawatt hours , it &apos;s roughly half what the U.S. solar industry produced last year .
And two terawatt hours ? In terms of coal , we &apos;d need to burn 34 of these wheelbarrows every minute around the clock every day for an entire year to get two terawatt hours of electricity .
And we &apos;re not burning anything .
We &apos;re just motivating people to pay attention and change their behavior .
But we &apos;re just one company , and this is just scratching the surface .
Twenty percent of the electricity in homes is wasted , and when I say wasted , I don &apos;t mean that people have inefficient lightbulbs . They may .
I mean we leave the lights on in empty rooms , and we leave the air conditioning on when nobody &apos;s home .
That &apos;s 40 billion dollars a year wasted on electricity that does not contribute to our well-being but does contribute to climate change .
That &apos;s 40 billion -- with a B -- every year in the U.S. alone .
That &apos;s half our coal usage right there .
Now thankfully , some of the world &apos;s best material scientists are looking to replace coal with sustainable resources like these , and this is both fantastic and essential .
But the most overlooked resource to get us to a sustainable energy future , it isn &apos;t on this slide .
It &apos;s in this room . It &apos;s you , and it &apos;s me .
And we can harness this resource with no new material science simply by applying behavioral science .
We can do it today , we know it works , and it will save us money right away .
So what are we waiting for ?
Well , in most places , utility regulation hasn &apos;t changed much since Thomas Edison .
Utilities are still rewarded when their customers waste energy .
They ought to be rewarded for helping their customers save it .
But this story is much more than about household energy use .
Take a look at the Prius .
It &apos;s efficient not only because Toyota invested in material science but because they invested in behavioral science .
The dashboard that shows drivers how much energy they &apos;re saving in real time makes former speed demons drive more like cautious grandmothers .
Which brings us back to Harriet .
We met her on our first family vacation .
She came over to meet my young daughter , and she was tickled to learn that my daughter &apos;s name is also Harriet .
She asked me what I did for a living , and I told her , I work with utilities to help people save energy .
It was then that her eyes lit up .
She looked at me , and she said , &quot; You &apos;re exactly the person I need to talk to .
You see , two weeks ago , my husband and I got a letter in the mail from our utility .
It told us we were using twice as much energy as our neighbors . &quot;
&quot; And for the last two weeks , all we can think about , talk about , and even argue about , is what we should be doing to save energy .
We did everything that letter told us to do , and still I know there must be more .
Now I &apos;m here with a genuine expert .
Tell me . What should I do to save energy ? &quot;
There are many experts who can help answer Harriet &apos;s question .
My goal is to make sure we are all asking it .
Thank you .

Ami Klin : A new way to diagnose autism
Early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder can improve the lives of everyone affected , but the complex network of causes make it incredibly difficult to predict . At TEDxPeachtree , Ami Klin describes a new early detection method that uses eye-tracking technologies to gauge babies &apos; social engagement skills and reliably measure their risk of developing autism . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
I always wanted to become a walking laboratory of social engagement , to resonate other people &apos;s feelings , thoughts , intentions , motivations , in the act of being with them .
As a scientist , I always wanted to measure that resonance , that sense of the other that happens so quickly , in the blink of an eye .
We intuit other people &apos;s feelings .
We know the meaning of their actions even before they happen .
We &apos;re always in this stance of being the object of somebody else &apos;s subjectivity .
We do that all the time . We just can &apos;t shake it off .
It &apos;s so important that the very tools that we use to understand ourselves , to understand the world around them , is shaped by that stance .
We are social to the core .
So my journey in autism really started when I lived in a residential unit for adults with autism .
Most of those individuals had spent most of their lives in long-stay hospitals . This is a long time ago .
And for them , autism was devastating .
They had profound intellectual disabilities .
They didn &apos;t talk . But most of all , they were extraordinarily isolated from the world around them , from their environment and from the people .
In fact , at the time , if you walked into a school for individuals with autism , you &apos;d hear a lot of noise , plenty of commotion , actions , people doing things , but they &apos;re always doing things by themselves .
So they may be looking at a light in the ceiling , or they may be isolated in the corner , or they might be engaged in these repetitive movements , in self-stimulatory movements that led them nowhere .
Extremely , extremely isolated .
Well , now we know that autism is this disruption , the disruption of this resonance that I am telling you .
These are survival skills .
These are survival skills that we inherited over many , many hundreds of thousands of years of evolution .
You see , babies are born in a state of utter fragility .
Without the caregiver , they wouldn &apos;t survive , so it stands to reason that nature would endow them with these mechanisms of survival .
They orient to the caregiver .
From the first days and weeks of life , babies prefer to hear human sounds rather than just sounds in the environment .
They prefer to look at people rather than at things , and even as they &apos;re looking at people , they look at people &apos;s eyes , because the eye is the window to the other person &apos;s experiences , so much so that they even prefer to look at people who are looking at them rather than people who are looking away .
Well , they orient to the caregiver .
The caregiver seeks the baby .
And it &apos;s out of this mutually reinforcing choreography that a lot that is of importance to the emergence of mind , the social mind , the social brain , depends on .
We always think about autism as something that happens later on in life .
It doesn &apos;t . It begins with the beginning of life .
As babies engage with caregivers , they soon realize that , well , there is something in between the ears that is very important -- it &apos;s invisible , you can &apos;t see -- but is really critical , and that thing is called attention .
And they learn soon enough , even before they can utter one word that they can take that attention and move somewhere in order to get things they want .
They also learn to follow other people &apos;s gaze , because whatever people are looking at is what they are thinking about .
And soon enough , they start to learn about the meaning of things , because when somebody is looking at something or somebody is pointing at something , they &apos;re not just getting a directional cue , they are getting the other person &apos;s meaning of that thing , the attitude , and soon enough they start building this body of meanings , but meanings that were acquired within the realm of social interaction .
Those are meanings that are acquired as part of their shared experiences with others .
Well , this is a little 15-month-old little girl , and she has autism .
And I am coming so close to her that I am maybe two inches from her face , and she &apos;s quite oblivious to me .
Imagine if I did that to you , and I came two inches from your face .
You &apos;d do probably two things , wouldn &apos;t you ?
You would recoil . You would call the police .
You would do something , because it &apos;s literally impossible to penetrate somebody &apos;s physical space and not get a reaction .
We do so , remember , intuitively , effortlessly .
This is our body wisdom . It &apos;s not something that is mediated by our language . Our body just knows that , and we &apos;ve known that for a long time .
And this is not something that happens to humans only .
It happens to some of our phylatic cousins , because if you &apos;re a monkey , and you look at another monkey , and that monkey has a higher hierarchy position than you , and that is considered to be a signal or threat , well , you are not going to be alive for long .
So something that in other species are survival mechanisms , without them they wouldn &apos;t basically live , we bring into the context of human beings , and this is what we need to simply act , act socially .
Now , she is oblivious to me , and I am so close to her , and you think , maybe she can see you , maybe she can hear you .
Well , a few minutes later , she goes to the corner of the room , and she finds a tiny little piece of candy , an M &amp; amp ; M.
So I could not attract her attention , but something , a thing , did .
Now , most of us make a big dichotomy between the world of things and the world of people .
Now , for this girl , that division line is not so clear , and the world of people is not attracting her as much as we would like .
Now remember that we learn a great deal by sharing experiences .
Now , what she is doing right now is that her path of learning is diverging moment by moment as she is isolating herself further and further .
So we feel sometimes that the brain is deterministic , the brain determines who we are going to be .
But in fact the brain also becomes who we are , and at the same time that her behaviors are taking away from the realm of social interaction , this is what &apos;s happening with her mind and this is what &apos;s happening with her brain .
Well , autism is the most strongly genetic condition of all developmental disorders , and it &apos;s a brain disorder .
It &apos;s a disorder that begins much prior to the time that the child is born .
We now know that there is a very broad spectrum of autism .
There are those individuals who are profoundly intellectually disabled , but there are those that are gifted .
There are those individuals who don &apos;t talk at all .
There are those individuals who talk too much .
There are those individuals that if you observe them in their school , you see them running the periphery fence of the school all day if you let them , to those individuals who cannot stop coming to you and trying to engage you repeatedly , relentlessly , but often in an awkward fashion , without that immediate resonance .
Well , this is much more prevalent than we thought at the time .
When I started in this field , we thought that there were four individuals with autism per 10,000 , a very rare condition .
Well , now we know it &apos;s more like one in 100 .
There are millions of individuals with autism all around us .
The societal cost of this condition is huge .
In the U.S. alone , maybe 35 to 80 billion dollars , and you know what ? Most of those funds are associated with adolescents and particularly adults who are severely disabled , individuals who need wrap-around services , services that are very , very intensive , and those services can cost in excess of 60 to 80,000 dollars a year .
Those are individuals who did not benefit from early treatment , because now we know that autism creates itself as they diverge in that pathway of learning that I mentioned to you .
Were we to be able to identify this condition at an earlier point , and intervene and treat , I can tell you , and this has been probably something that has changed my life in the past 10 years , this notion that we can absolutely attenuate this condition .
Also , we have a window of opportunity , because the brain is malleable for just so long , and that window of opportunity happens in the first three years of life .
It &apos;s not that that window closes . It doesn &apos;t .
But it diminishes considerably .
And yet , the median age of diagnosis in this country is still about five years , and in disadvantaged populations , the populations that don &apos;t have access to clinical services , rural populations , minorities , the age of diagnosis is later still , which is almost as if I were to tell you that we are condemning those communities to have individuals with autism whose condition is going to be more severe .
So I feel that we have a bio-ethical imperative .
The science is there , but no science is of relevance if it doesn &apos;t have an impact on the community , and we just can &apos;t afford that missed opportunity , because children with autism become adults with autism , and we feel that those things that we can do for these children , for those families , early on , will have lifetime consequences , for the child , for the family , and for the community at large .
So this is our view of autism .
There are over a hundred genes that are associated with autism . In fact , we believe that there are going to be something between 300 and 600 genes associated with autism , and genetic anomalies , much more than just genes .
And we actually have a bit of a question here , because if there are so many different causes of autism , how do you go from those liabilities to the actual syndrome ? Because people like myself , when we walk into a playroom , we recognize a child as having autism .
So how do you go from multiple causes to a syndrome that has some homogeneity ?
And the answer is , what lies in between , which is development .
And in fact , we are very interested in those first two years of life , because those liabilities don &apos;t necessarily convert into autism .
Autism creates itself .
Were we to be able to intervene during those years of life , we might attenuate for some , and God knows , maybe even prevent for others .
So how do we do that ?
How do we enter that feeling of resonance , how do we enter another person &apos;s being ?
I remember when I interacted with that 15-month-older , that the thing that came to mind was , &quot; How do you come into her world ?
Is she thinking about me ? Is she thinking about others ? &quot;
Well , it &apos;s hard to do that , so we had to create the technologies . We had to basically step inside a body .
We had to see the world through her eyes .
And so in the past many years we &apos;ve been building these new technologies that are based on eye tracking .
We can see moment by moment what children are engaging with .
Well , this is my colleague Warren Jones , with whom we &apos;ve been building these methods , these studies , for the past 12 years , and you see there a happy five-month-older , it &apos;s a five-month little boy who is going to watch things that are brought from his world , his mom , the caregiver , but also experiences that he would have were he to be in his daycare .
What we want is to embrace that world and bring it into our laboratory , but in order for us to do that , we had to create these very sophisticated measures , measures of how people , how little babies , how newborns , engage with the world , moment by moment , what is important , and what is not .
Well , we created those measures , and here , what you see is what we call a funnel of attention .
You &apos;re watching a video .
Those frames are separated by about a second through the eyes of 35 typically developing two-year-olds , and we freeze one frame , and this is what the typical children are doing .
In this scan pass , in green here , are two-year-olds with autism .
So on that frame , the children who are typical are watching this , the emotion of expression of that little boy as he &apos;s fighting a little bit with the little girl .
What are the children with autism doing ?
They are focusing on the revolving door , opening and shutting .
Well , I can tell you that this divergence that you &apos;re seeing here doesn &apos;t happen only in our five-minute experiment .
It happens moment by moment in their real lives , and their minds are being formed , and their brains are being specialized in something other than what is happening with their typical peers .
Well , we took a construct from our pediatrician friends , the concept of growth charts .
You know , when you take a child to the pediatrician , and so you have physical height , and weight .
Well we decided that we &apos;re going to create growth charts of social engagement , and we sought children from the time that they are born , and what you see here on the x-axis is two , three , four , five , six months and nine , until about the age of 24 months , and this is the percent of their viewing time that they are focusing on people &apos;s eyes , and this is their growth chart .
They start over here , they love people &apos;s eyes , and it remains quite stable .
It sort of goes up a little bit in those initial months .
Now , let &apos;s see what &apos;s happening with babies who became autistic .
It &apos;s something very different .
It starts way up here , but then it &apos;s a free fall .
It &apos;s very much like they brought into this world the reflex that orients them to people , but it has no traction .
It &apos;s almost as if that stimulus , you , you &apos;re not exerting influence on what happens as they navigate their daily lives .
Now , we thought that those data were so powerful in a way , that we wanted to see what happened in the first six months of life , because if you interact with a two- and a three-month-older , you &apos;d be surprised by how social those babies are .
And what we see in the first six months of life is that those two groups can be segregated very easily .
And using these kinds of measures , and many others , what we found out is that our science could , in fact , identify this condition early on .
We didn &apos;t have to wait for the behaviors of autism to emerge in the second year of life .
If we measured things that are , evolutionarily , highly conserved , and developmentally very early emerging , things that are online from the first weeks of life , we could push the detection of autism all the way to those first months , and that &apos;s what we are doing now .
Now , we can create the very best technologies and the very best methods to identify the children , but this would be for naught if we didn &apos;t have an impact on what happens in their reality in the community .
Now we want those devices , of course , to be deployed by those who are in the trenches , our colleagues , the primary care physicians , who see every child , and we need to transform those technologies into something that is going to add value to their practice , because they have to see so many children .
And we want to do that universally so that we don &apos;t miss any child , but this would be immoral if we also did not have an infrastructure for intervention , for treatment .
We need to be able to work with the families , to support the families , to manage those first years with them . We need to be able to really go from universal screening to universal access to treatment , because those treatments are going to change these children &apos;s and those families &apos; lives .
Now , when we think about what we &#91; can &#93; do in those first years , I can tell you , having been in this field for so long , one feels really rejuvenated .
There is a sense that the science that one worked on can actually have an impact on realities , preventing , in fact , those experiences that I really started in my journey in this field .
I thought at the time that this was an intractable condition .
No longer . We can do a great deal of things .
And the idea is not to cure autism .
That &apos;s not the idea .
What we want is to make sure that those individuals with autism can be free from the devastating consequences that come with it at times , the profound intellectual disabilities , the lack of language , the profound , profound isolation .
We feel that individuals with autism , in fact , have a very special perspective on the world , and we need diversity , and they can work extremely well in some areas of strength : predictable situations , situations that can be defined .
Because after all , they learn about the world almost like about it , rather than learning how to function in it .
But this is a strength , if you &apos;re working , for example , in technology .
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
We want them to be free of that .
We want that the next generations of individuals with autism will be able not only to express their strengths but to fulfill their promise .
Well thank you for listening to me .
Alan Siegel : Let &apos;s simplify legal jargon !
Tax forms , credit agreements , healthcare legislation : They &apos;re crammed with gobbledygook , says Alan Siegel , and incomprehensibly long . He calls for a simple , sensible redesign -- and plain English -- to make legal paperwork intelligible to the rest of us .
So , basically we have public leaders , public officials who are out of control ; they are writing bills that are unintelligible , and out of these bills are going to come maybe 40,000 pages of regulations , total complexity , which has a dramatically negative impact on our life .
If you &apos;re a veteran coming back from Iraq or Vietnam you face a blizzard of paperwork to get your benefits ; if you &apos;re trying to get a small business loan , you face a blizzard of paperwork .
What are we going to do about it ? I define simplicity as a means to achieving clarity , transparency and empathy , building humanity into communications .
I &apos;ve been simplifying things for 30 years .
I come out of the advertising and design business .
My focus is understanding you people , and how you interact with the government to get your benefits , how you interact with corporations to decide whom you &apos;re going to do business with , and how you view brands .
So , very quickly , when President Obama said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why we can &apos;t have a one-page , plain English consumer credit agreement . &quot;
So , I locked myself in a room , figured out the content , organized the document , and wrote it in plain English .
I &apos;ve had this checked by the two top consumer credit lawyers in the country .
This is a real thing .
Now , I went one step further and said , &quot; Why do we have to stick with the stodgy lawyers and just have a paper document ? Let &apos;s go online . &quot;
And many people might need help in computation .
Working with the Harvard Business School , you &apos;ll see this example when you talk about minimum payment : If you spent 62 dollars for a meal , the longer you take to pay out that loan , you see , over a period of time using the minimum payment it &apos;s 99 dollars and 17 cents .
How about that ? Do you think your bank is going to show that to people ?
But it &apos;s going to work . It &apos;s more effective than just computational aids .
And what about terms like &quot; over the limit &quot; ?
Perhaps a stealth thing .
Define it in context . Tell people what it means .
When you put it in plain English , you almost force the institution to give the people a way , a default out of that , and not put themselves at risk .
Plain English is about changing the content .
And one of the things I &apos;m most proud of is this agreement for IBM .
It &apos;s a grid , it &apos;s a calendar .
At such and such a date , IBM has responsibilities , you have responsibilities .
Received very favorably by business .
And there is some good news to report today .
Each year , one in 10 taxpayers receives a notice from the IRS .
There are 200 million letters that go out .
Running through this typical letter that they had , I ran it through my simplicity lab , it &apos;s pretty unintelligible .
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible .
We looked at doing over 1,000 letters that cover 70 percent of their transactions in plain English .
They have been tested in the laboratory .
When I run it through my lab , this heat-mapping shows everything is intelligible .
And the IRS has introduced the program .
There are a couple of things going on right now that I want to bring to your attention .
There is a lot of discussion now about a consumer financial protection agency , how to mandate simplicity .
We see all this complexity .
It &apos;s incumbent upon us , and this organization , I believe , to make clarity , transparency and empathy a national priority .
There is no way that we should allow government to communicate the way they communicate .
There is no way we should do business with companies that have agreements with stealth provisions and that are unintelligible .
So , how are we going to change the world ?
Make clarity , transparency and simplicity a national priority .
I thank you .
Rodney Brooks : Why we will rely on robots
Scaremongers play on the idea that robots will simply replace people on the job . In fact , they can become our essential collaborators , freeing us up to spend time on less mundane and mechanical challenges . Rodney Brooks points out how valuable this could be as the number of working-age adults drops and the number of retirees swells . He introduces us to Baxter , the robot with eyes that move and arms that react to touch , which could work alongside an aging population -- and learn to help them at home , too .
Well , Arthur C. Clarke , a famous science fiction writer from the 1950s , said that , &quot; We overestimate technology in the short term , and we underestimate it in the long term . &quot;
And I think that &apos;s some of the fear that we see about jobs disappearing from artificial intelligence and robots .
That we &apos;re overestimating the technology in the short term .
But I am worried whether we &apos;re going to get the technology we need in the long term .
Because the demographics are really going to leave us with lots of jobs that need doing and that we , our society , is going to have to be built on the shoulders of steel of robots in the future .
So I &apos;m scared we won &apos;t have enough robots .
But fear of losing jobs to technology has been around for a long time .
Back in 1957 , there was a Spencer Tracy , Katharine Hepburn movie .
So you know how it ended up , Spencer Tracy brought a computer , a mainframe computer of 1957 , in to help the librarians .
The librarians in the company would do things like answer for the executives , &quot; What are the names of Santa &apos;s reindeer ? &quot;
And they would look that up .
And this mainframe computer was going to help them with that job .
Well of course a mainframe computer in 1957 wasn &apos;t much use for that job .
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
But that &apos;s not what happened in fact .
The number of jobs for librarians increased for a long time after 1957 .
It wasn &apos;t until the Internet came into play , the web came into play and search engines came into play that the need for librarians went down .
And I think everyone from 1957 totally underestimated the level of technology we would all carry around in our hands and in our pockets today .
And we can just ask : &quot; What are the names of Santa &apos;s reindeer ? &quot; and be told instantly -- or anything else we want to ask .
By the way , the wages for librarians went up faster than the wages for other jobs in the U.S. over that same time period , because librarians became partners of computers .
Computers became tools , and they got more tools that they could use and become more effective during that time .
Same thing happened in offices .
Back in the old days , people used spreadsheets .
Spreadsheets were spread sheets of paper , and they calculated by hand .
But here was an interesting thing that came along .
With the revolution around 1980 of P.C. &apos; s , the spreadsheet programs were tuned for office workers , not to replace office workers , but it respected office workers as being capable of being programmers .
So office workers became programmers of spreadsheets .
It increased their capabilities .
They no longer had to do the mundane computations , but they could do something much more .
Now today , we &apos;re starting to see robots in our lives .
On the left there is the PackBot from iRobot .
When soldiers came across roadside bombs in Iraq and Afghanistan , instead of putting on a bomb suit and going out and poking with a stick , as they used to do up until about 2002 , they now send the robot out .
So the robot takes over the dangerous jobs .
On the right are some TUGs from a company called Aethon in Pittsburgh .
These are in hundreds of hospitals across the U.S.
And they take the dirty sheets down to the laundry .
They take the dirty dishes back to the kitchen .
They bring the medicines up from the pharmacy .
And it frees up the nurses and the nurse &apos;s aides from doing that mundane work of just mechanically pushing stuff around to spend more time with patients .
In fact , robots have become sort of ubiquitous in our lives in many ways .
But I think when it comes to factory robots , people are sort of afraid , because factory robots are dangerous to be around .
In order to program them , you have to understand six-dimensional vectors and quaternions .
And ordinary people can &apos;t interact with them .
And I think it &apos;s the sort of technology that &apos;s gone wrong .
It &apos;s displaced the worker from the technology .
And I think we really have to look at technologies that ordinary workers can interact with .
And so I want to tell you today about Baxter , which we &apos;ve been talking about .
And Baxter , I see , as a way -- a first wave of robot that ordinary people can interact with in an industrial setting .
So Baxter is up here .
This is Chris Harbert from Rethink Robotics .
We &apos;ve got a conveyor there .
And if the lighting isn &apos;t too extreme -- Ah , ah ! There it is . It &apos;s picked up the object off the conveyor .
It &apos;s going to come bring it over here and put it down .
And then it &apos;ll go back , reach for another object .
The interesting thing is Baxter has some basic common sense .
By the way , what &apos;s going on with the eyes ?
The eyes are on the screen there .
The eyes look ahead where the robot &apos;s going to move .
So a person that &apos;s interacting with the robot understands where it &apos;s going to reach and isn &apos;t surprised by its motions .
Here Chris took the object out of its hand , and Baxter didn &apos;t go and try to put it down ; it went back and realized it had to get another one .
It &apos;s got a little bit of basic common sense , goes and picks the objects .
And Baxter &apos;s safe to interact with .
You wouldn &apos;t want to do this with a current industrial robot .
But with Baxter it doesn &apos;t hurt .
It feels the force , understands that Chris is there and doesn &apos;t push through him and hurt him .
But I think the most interesting thing about Baxter is the user interface .
And so Chris is going to come and grab the other arm now .
And when he grabs an arm , it goes into zero-force gravity-compensated mode and graphics come up on the screen .
You can see some icons on the left of the screen there for what was about its right arm .
He &apos;s going to put something in its hand , he &apos;s going to bring it over here , press a button and let go of that thing in the hand .
And the robot figures out , ah , he must mean I want to put stuff down .
It puts a little icon there .
He comes over here , and he gets the fingers to grasp together , and the robot infers , ah , you want an object for me to pick up .
That puts the green icon there .
He &apos;s going to map out an area of where the robot should pick up the object from .
It just moves it around , and the robot figures out that was an area search .
He didn &apos;t have to select that from a menu .
And now he &apos;s going to go off and train the visual appearance of that object while we continue talking .
So as we continue here , I want to tell you about what this is like in factories .
These robots we &apos;re shipping every day .
They go to factories around the country .
This is Mildred .
Mildred &apos;s a factory worker in Connecticut .
She &apos;s worked on the line for over 20 years .
One hour after she saw her first industrial robot , she had programmed it to do some tasks in the factory .
She decided she really liked robots .
And it was doing the simple repetitive tasks that she had had to do beforehand .
Now she &apos;s got the robot doing it .
When we first went out to talk to people in factories about how we could get robots to interact with them better , one of the questions we asked them was , &quot; Do you want your children to work in a factory ? &quot;
The universal answer was &quot; No , I want a better job than that for my children . &quot;
And as a result of that , Mildred is very typical of today &apos;s factory workers in the U.S.
They &apos;re older , and they &apos;re getting older and older .
There aren &apos;t many young people coming into factory work .
And as their tasks become more onerous on them , we need to give them tools that they can collaborate with , so that they can be part of the solution , so that they can continue to work and we can continue to produce in the U.S.
And so our vision is that Mildred who &apos;s the line worker becomes Mildred the robot trainer .
She lifts her game , like the office workers of the 1980s lifted their game of what they could do .
We &apos;re not giving them tools that they have to go and study for years and years in order to use .
They &apos;re tools that they can just learn how to operate in a few minutes .
There &apos;s two great forces that are both volitional but inevitable .
That &apos;s climate change and demographics .
Demographics is really going to change our world .
This is the percentage of adults who are working age .
And it &apos;s gone down slightly over the last 40 years .
But over the next 40 years , it &apos;s going to change dramatically , even in China .
The percentage of adults who are working age drops dramatically .
And turned up the other way , the people who are retirement age goes up very , very fast , as the baby boomers get to retirement age .
That means there will be more people with fewer social security dollars competing for services .
But more than that , as we get older we get more frail and we can &apos;t do all the tasks we used to do .
If we look at the statistics on the ages of caregivers , before our eyes those caregivers are getting older and older .
That &apos;s happening statistically right now .
And as the number of people who are older , above retirement age and getting older , as they increase , there will be less people to take care of them .
And I think we &apos;re really going to have to have robots to help us .
And I don &apos;t mean robots in terms of companions .
I mean robots doing the things that we normally do for ourselves but get harder as we get older .
Getting the groceries in from the car , up the stairs , into the kitchen .
Or even , as we get very much older , driving our cars to go visit people .
And I think robotics gives people a chance to have dignity as they get older by having control of the robotic solution .
So they don &apos;t have to rely on people that are getting scarcer to help them .
And so I really think that we &apos;re going to be spending more time with robots like Baxter and working with robots like Baxter in our daily lives . And that we will -- Here , Baxter , it &apos;s good .
And that we will all come to rely on robots over the next 40 years as part of our everyday lives .
Thanks very much .
Marco Tempest : A magical tale
Marco Tempest spins a beautiful story of what magic is , how it entertains us and how it highlights our humanity -- all while working extraordinary illusions with his hands and an augmented reality machine .
Marco Tempest : What I &apos;d like to show you today is something in the way of an experiment .
Today &apos;s its debut .
It &apos;s a demonstration of augmented reality .
And the visuals you &apos;re about to see are not prerecorded .
They are live and reacting to me in real time .
I like to think of it as a kind of technological magic .
So fingers crossed .
And keep your eyes on the big screen .
Augmented reality is the melding of the real world with computer-generated imagery .
It seems the perfect medium to investigate magic and ask , why , in a technological age , we continue to have this magical sense of wonder .
Magic is deception , but it is a deception we enjoy .
To enjoy being deceived , an audience must first suspend its disbelief .
It was the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge who first suggested this receptive state of mind .
Samuel Taylor Coleridge : I try to convey a semblance of truth in my writing to produce for these shadows of the imagination a willing suspension of disbelief that , for a moment , constitutes poetic faith .
MT : This faith in the fictional is essential for any kind of theatrical experience .
Without it , a script is just words .
Augmented reality is just the latest technology .
And sleight of hand is just an artful demonstration of dexterity .
We are all very good at suspending our disbelief .
We do it every day , while reading novels , watching television or going to the movies .
We willingly enter fictional worlds where we cheer our heroes and cry for friends we never had .
Without this ability there is no magic .
It was Jean Robert-Houdin , France &apos;s greatest illusionist , who first recognized the role of the magician as a storyteller .
He said something that I &apos;ve posted on the wall of my studio .
Jean Robert-Houdin : A conjurer is not a juggler .
He is an actor playing the part of a magician .
MT : Which means magic is theater and every trick is a story .
The tricks of magic follow the archetypes of narrative fiction .
There are tales of creation and loss , death and resurrection , and obstacles that must be overcome .
Now many of them are intensely dramatic .
Magicians play with fire and steel , defy the fury of the buzzsaw , dare to catch a bullet or attempt a deadly escape .
But audiences don &apos;t come to see the magician die , they come to see him live .
Because the best stories always have a happy ending .
The tricks of magic have one special element .
They are stories with a twist .
Now Edward de Bono argued that our brains are pattern matching machines .
He said that magicians deliberately exploit the way their audiences think .
Edward de Bono : Stage magic relies almost wholly on the momentum error .
The audience is led to make assumptions or elaborations that are perfectly reasonable , but do not , in fact , match what is being done in front of them .
MT : In that respect , magic tricks are like jokes .
Jokes lead us down a path to an expected destination .
But when the scenario we have imagined suddenly flips into something entirely unexpected , we laugh .
The same thing happens when people watch magic tricks .
The finale defies logic , gives new insight into the problem , and audiences express their amazement with laughter .
It &apos;s fun to be fooled .
One of the key qualities of all stories is that they &apos;re made to be shared .
We feel compelled to tell them .
When I do a trick at a party -- that person will immediately pull their friend over and ask me to do it again .
They want to share the experience .
That makes my job more difficult , because , if I want to surprise them , I need to tell a story that starts the same , but ends differently -- a trick with a twist on a twist .
It keeps me busy .
Now experts believe that stories go beyond our capacity for keeping us entertained .
We think in narrative structures .
We connect events and emotions and instinctively transform them into a sequence that can be easily understood .
It &apos;s a uniquely human achievement .
We all want to share our stories , whether it is the trick we saw at the party , the bad day at the office or the beautiful sunset we saw on vacation .
Today , thanks to technology , we can share those stories as never before , by email , Facebook , blogs , tweets , on TED.com.
The tools of social networking , these are the digital campfires around which the audience gathers to hear our story .
We turn facts into similes and metaphors , and even fantasies .
We polish the rough edges of our lives so that they feel whole .
Our stories make us the people we are and , sometimes , the people we want to be .
They give us our identity and a sense of community .
And if the story is a good one , it might even make us smile .
Thank you .

Chip Kidd : Designing books is no laughing matter . OK , it is .
Chip Kidd doesn &apos;t judge books by their cover , he creates covers that embody the book -- and he does it with a wicked sense of humor . In one of the funniest talks from TED2012 , he shows the art and deep thought of his cover designs . This talk is from The Design Studio session at TED2012 , guest-curated by Chee Pearlman and David Rockwell .
Hi .
I did that for two reasons .
First of all , I wanted to give you a good visual first impression .
But the main reason I did it is that that &apos;s what happens to me when I &apos;m forced to wear a Lady Gaga skanky mic .
I &apos;m used to a stationary mic .
It &apos;s the sensible shoe of public address .
But you clamp this thing on my head , and something happens .
I just become skanky .
So I &apos;m sorry about that .
And I &apos;m already off-message .
Ladies and gentlemen , I have devoted the past 25 years of my life to designing books .
( &quot; Yes , BOOKS . You know , the bound volumes with ink on paper .
You cannot turn them off with a switch .
Tell your kids . &quot; ) It all sort of started as a benign mistake , like penicillin .
What I really wanted was to be a graphic designer at one of the big design firms in New York City .
But upon arrival there , in the fall of 1986 , and doing a lot of interviews , I found that the only thing I was offered was to be Assistant to the Art Director at Alfred A. Knopf , a book publisher .
Now I was stupid , but not so stupid that I turned it down .
I had absolutely no idea what I was about to become part of , and I was incredibly lucky .
Soon , it had occurred to me what my job was .
My job was to ask this question : &quot; What do the stories look like ? &quot;
Because that is what Knopf is .
It is the story factory , one of the very best in the world .
We bring stories to the public .
The stories can be anything , and some of them are actually true .
But they all have one thing in common : They all need to look like something .
They all need a face .
Why ? To give you a first impression of what you are about to get into .
A book designer gives form to content , but also manages a very careful balance between the two .
Now , the first day of my graphic design training at Penn State University , the teacher , Lanny Sommese , came into the room and he drew a picture of an apple on the blackboard , and wrote the word &quot; Apple &quot; underneath , and he said , &quot; OK . Lesson one . Listen up . &quot;
And he covered up the picture and he said , &quot; You either say this , &quot; and then he covered up the word , &quot; or you show this .
But you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
Because this is treating your audience like a moron .
And they deserve better .
And lo and behold , soon enough , I was able to put this theory to the test on two books that I was working on for Knopf .
The first was Katharine Hepburn &apos;s memoirs , and the second was a biography of Marlene Dietrich .
Now the Hepburn book was written in a very conversational style , it was like she was sitting across a table telling it all to you .
The Dietrich book was an observation by her daughter ; it was a biography .
So the Hepburn story is words and the Dietrich story is pictures , and so we did this .
So there you are .
Pure content and pure form , side by side .
No fighting , ladies .
Now , what is the story here ?
Someone is re-engineering dinosaurs by extracting their DNA from prehistoric amber .
Genius !
Now , luckily for me , I live and work in New York City , where there are plenty of dinosaurs .
So , I went to the Museum of Natural History , and I checked out the bones , and I went to the gift shop , and I bought a book .
And I was particularly taken with this page of the book , and more specifically the lower right-hand corner .
Now I took this diagram , and I put it in a Photostat machine , and I took a piece of tracing paper , and I taped it over the Photostat with a piece of Scotch tape -- stop me if I &apos;m going too fast -- -- and then I took a Rapidograph pen -- explain it to the youngsters -- and I just started to reconstitute the dinosaur .
I had no idea what I was doing , I had no idea where I was going , but at some point , I stopped -- when to keep going would seem like I was going too far .
And what I ended up with was a graphic representation of us seeing this animal coming into being .
We &apos;re in the middle of the process .
And then I just threw some typography on it .
Very basic stuff , slightly suggestive of public park signage .
Everybody in house loved it , and so off it goes to the author .
And even back then , Michael was on the cutting edge .
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine .
I miss Michael .
And sure enough , somebody from MCA Universal calls our legal department to see if they can maybe look into buying the rights to the image , just in case they might want to use it .
Well , they used it .
And I was thrilled .
We all know it was an amazing movie , and it was so interesting to see it go out into the culture and become this phenomenon and to see all the different permutations of it .
But not too long ago , I came upon this on the Web .
No , that is not me .
But whoever it is , I can &apos;t help but thinking they woke up one day like , &quot; Oh my God , that wasn &apos;t there last night . Ooooohh !
I was so wasted . &quot;
But if you think about it , from my head to my hands to his leg .
That &apos;s a responsibility .
And it &apos;s a responsibility that I don &apos;t take lightly .
The book designer &apos;s responsibility is threefold : to the reader , to the publisher and , most of all , to the author .
I want you to look at the author &apos;s book and say , &quot; Wow ! I need to read that . &quot;
David Sedaris is one of my favorite writers , and the title essay in this collection is about his trip to a nudist colony .
And the reason he went is because he had a fear of his body image , and he wanted to explore what was underlying that .
For me , it was simply an excuse to design a book that you could literally take the pants off of .
But when you do , you don &apos;t get what you expect .
You get something that goes much deeper than that .
And David especially loved this design because at book signings , which he does a lot of , he could take a magic marker and do this .
Hello !
Augusten Burroughs wrote a memoir called &#91; &quot; Dry &quot; &#93; , and it &apos;s about his time in rehab .
In his 20s , he was a hotshot ad executive , and as Mad Men has told us , a raging alcoholic .
He did not think so , however , but his coworkers did an intervention and they said , &quot; You are going to rehab , or you will be fired and you will die . &quot;
Now to me , this was always going to be a typographic solution , what I would call the opposite of Type 101 .
What does that mean ?
Usually on the first day of Introduction to Typography , you get the assignment of , select a word and make it look like what it says it is . So that &apos;s Type 101 , right ?
Very simple stuff .
This is going to be the opposite of that .
I want this book to look like it &apos;s lying to you , desperately and hopelessly , the way an alcoholic would .
The answer was the most low-tech thing you can imagine .
I set up the type , I printed it out on an Epson printer with water-soluble ink , taped it to the wall and threw a bucket of water at it . Presto !
Then when we went to press , the printer put a spot gloss on the ink and it really looked like it was running .
Not long after it came out , Augusten was waylaid in an airport and he was hiding out in the bookstore spying on who was buying his books .
And this woman came up to it , and she squinted , and she took it to the register , and she said to the man behind the counter , &quot; This one &apos;s ruined . &quot;
And the guy behind the counter said , &quot; I know , lady . They all came in that way . &quot;
Now , that &apos;s a good printing job .
A book cover is a distillation .
It is a haiku , if you will , of the story .
This particular story by Osama Tezuka is his epic life of the Buddha , and it &apos;s eight volumes in all . But the best thing is when it &apos;s on your shelf , you get a shelf life of the Buddha , moving from one age to the next .
All of these solutions derive their origins from the text of the book , but once the book designer has read the text , then he has to be an interpreter and a translator .
This story was a real puzzle .
This is what it &apos;s about .
All right , so I got a collection of the paintings together and I looked at them and I deconstructed them and I put them back together .
And so , here &apos;s the design , right ?
And so here &apos;s the front and the spine , and it &apos;s flat .
But the real story starts when you wrap it around a book and put it on the shelf .
Ahh ! We come upon them , the clandestine lovers . Let &apos;s draw them out .
Huhh ! They &apos;ve been discovered by the sultan .
He will not be pleased .
Huhh ! And now the sultan is in danger .
And now , we have to open it up to find out what &apos;s going to happen next .
Try experiencing that on a Kindle .
Don &apos;t get me started .
Seriously .
Much is to be gained by eBooks : ease , convenience , portability .
But something is definitely lost : tradition , a sensual experience , the comfort of thingy-ness -- a little bit of humanity .
Do you know what John Updike used to do the first thing when he would get a copy of one of his new books from Alfred A. Knopf ?
He &apos;d smell it .
Then he &apos;d run his hand over the rag paper , and the pungent ink and the deckled edges of the pages .
All those years , all those books , he never got tired of it .
Now , I am all for the iPad , but trust me -- smelling it will get you nowhere .
Now the Apple guys are texting , &quot; Develop odor emission plug-in . &quot;
And the last story I &apos;m going to talk about is quite a story .
A woman named Aomame in 1984 Japan finds herself negotiating down a spiral staircase off an elevated highway . When she gets to the bottom , she can &apos;t help but feel that , all of a sudden , she &apos;s entered a new reality that &apos;s just slightly different from the one that she left , but very similar , but different .
And so , we &apos;re talking about parallel planes of existence , sort of like a book jacket and the book that it covers .
So how do we show this ?
We go back to Hepburn and Dietrich , but now we merge them .
So we &apos;re talking about different planes , different pieces of paper .
So this is on a semi-transparent piece of velum .
It &apos;s one part of the form and content .
When it &apos;s on top of the paper board , which is the opposite , it forms this .
So even if you don &apos;t know anything about this book , you are forced to consider a single person straddling two planes of existence .
And the object itself invited exploration interaction , consideration and touch .
This debuted at number two on the New York Times Best Seller list .
This is unheard of , both for us the publisher , and the author .
We &apos;re talking a 900-page book that is as weird as it is compelling , and featuring a climactic scene in which a horde of tiny people emerge from the mouth of a sleeping girl and cause a German Shepherd to explode .
Not exactly Jackie Collins .
Fourteen weeks on the Best Seller list , eight printings , and still going strong .
So even though we love publishing as an art , we very much know it &apos;s a business too , and that if we do our jobs right and get a little lucky , that great art can be great business .
So that &apos;s my story . To be continued .
What does it look like ?
Yes . It can , it does and it will , but for this book designer , page-turner , dog-eared place-holder , notes in the margins-taker , ink-sniffer , the story looks like this .
Thank you .
Aicha el-Wafi + Phyllis Rodriguez : The mothers who found forgiveness , friendship
Phyllis Rodriguez and Aicha el-Wafi have a powerful friendship born of unthinkable loss . Rodriguez &apos; son was killed in the World Trade Center attacks on September 11 , 2001 ; el-Wafi &apos;s son Zacarias Moussaoui was convicted of a role in those attacks and is serving a life sentence . In hoping to find peace , these two moms have come to understand and respect one another .
Phyllis Rodriguez : We are here today because of the fact that we have what most people consider an unusual friendship .
And it is .
And yet , it feels natural to us now .
I first learned that my son had been in the World Trade Center on the morning of September 11th , 2001 .
We didn &apos;t know if he had perished yet until 36 hours later .
At the time , we knew that it was political .
We were afraid of what our country was going to do in the name of our son -- my husband , Orlando , and I and our family .
And when I saw it -- and yet , through the shock , the terrible shock , and the terrible explosion in our lives , literally , we were not vengeful .
And a couple of weeks later when Zacarias Moussaoui was indicted on six counts of conspiracy to commit terrorism , and the U.S. government called for a death penalty for him , if convicted , my husband and I spoke out in opposition to that , publicly .
Through that and through human rights groups , we were brought together with several other victims &apos; families .
When I saw Aicha in the media , coming over when her son was indicted , and I thought , &quot; What a brave woman .
Someday I want to meet that woman when I &apos;m stronger . &quot;
I was still in deep grief ; I knew I didn &apos;t have the strength .
I knew I would find her someday , or we would find each other .
Because , when people heard that my son was a victim , I got immediate sympathy .
But when people learned what her son was accused of , she didn &apos;t get that sympathy .
But her suffering is equal to mine .
So we met in November 2002 , and Aicha will now tell you how that came about .
Aicha el-Wafi : Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
I am the mother of Zacarias Moussaoui .
And I asked the Organization of Human Rights to put me in touch with the parents of the victims .
So they introduced me to five families .
And I saw Phyllis , and I watched her .
She was the only mother in the group .
The others were brothers , sisters .
And I saw in her eyes that she was a mother , just like me .
I suffered a lot as a mother .
I was married when I was 14 .
I lost a child when I was 15 , a second child when I was 16 .
So the story with Zacarias was too much really .
And I still suffer , because my son is like he &apos;s buried alive .
I know she really cried for her son .
But she knows where he is .
My son , I don &apos;t know where he is .
I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s alive . I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s tortured .
I don &apos;t know what happened to him .
So that &apos;s why I decided to tell my story , so that my suffering is something positive for other women .
For all the women , all the mothers that give life , you can give back , you can change .
It &apos;s up to us women , because we are women , because we love our children .
We must be hand-in-hand and do something together .
It &apos;s not against women , it &apos;s for us , for us women , for our children .
I talk against violence , against terrorism .
I go to schools to talk to young , Muslim girls so they don &apos;t accept to be married against their will very young .
So if I can save one of the young girls , and avoid that they get married and suffer as much as I did , well this is something good .
This is why I &apos;m here in front of you .
PR : I would like to say that I have learned so much from Aicha , starting with that day we had our very first meeting with other family members -- which was a very private meeting with security , because it was November 2002 , and , frankly , we were afraid of the super-patriotism of that time in the country -- those of us family members .
But we were all so nervous .
&quot; Why does she want to meet us ? &quot;
And then she was nervous .
&quot; Why did we want to meet her ? &quot;
What did we want from each other ?
Before we knew each others &apos; names , or anything , we had embraced and wept .
Then we sat in a circle with support , with help , from people experienced in this kind of reconciliation .
And Aicha started , and she said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if my son is guilty or innocent , but I want to tell you how sorry I am for what happened to your families .
I know what it is to suffer , and I feel that if there is a crime , a person should be tried fairly and punished . &quot;
But she reached out to us in that way , and it was , I &apos;d like to say , it was an ice-breaker .
And what happened then is we all told our stories , and we all connected as human beings .
By the end of the afternoon -- it was about three hours after lunch -- we &apos;d felt as if we &apos;d known each other forever .
Now what I learned from her , is a woman , not only who could be so generous under these present circumstances and what it was then , and what was being done to her son , but the life she &apos;s had .
I never had met someone with such a hard life , from such a totally different culture and environment from my own .
And I feel that we have a special connection , which I value very much .
And I think it &apos;s all about being afraid of the other , but making that step and then realizing , &quot; Hey , this wasn &apos;t so hard .
Who else can I meet that I don &apos;t know , or that I &apos;m so different from ? &quot;
So , Aicha , do you have a couple of words for conclusion ?
Because our time is up .
AW : I wanted to say that we have to try to know other people , the other .
You have to be generous , and your hearts must be generous , your mind must be generous .
You must be tolerant .
You have to fight against violence .
And I hope that someday we &apos;ll all live together in peace and respecting each other .
This is what I wanted to say .

Graham Hill : Why I &apos;m a weekday vegetarian
We all know the arguments that being vegetarian is better for the environment and for the animals -- but in a carnivorous culture , it can be hard to make the change . Graham Hill has a powerful , pragmatic suggestion : Be a weekday veg .
About a year ago , I asked myself a question : &quot; Knowing what I know , why am I not a vegetarian ? &quot;
After all , I &apos;m one of the green guys : I grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin .
I started a site called TreeHugger -- I care about this stuff .
I knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third .
Cruelty : I knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we , hypocritically , wouldn &apos;t even consider for our own cats , dogs and other pets .
Environmentally , meat , amazingly , causes more emissions than all of transportation combined : cars , trains , planes , buses , boats , all of it .
And beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do .
I also knew that I &apos;m not alone .
We as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s .
So what was once the special little side treat now is the main , much more regular .
So really , any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian .
Yet , there I was -- chk , chk , chk -- tucking into a big old steak .
So why was I stalling ?
I realized that what I was being pitched was a binary solution .
It was either you &apos;re a meat eater or you &apos;re a vegetarian , and I guess I just wasn &apos;t quite ready .
Imagine your last hamburger .
So my common sense , my good intentions , were in conflict with my taste buds .
And I &apos;d commit to doing it later , and not surprisingly , later never came .
Sound familiar ?
So I wondered , might there be a third solution ?
And I thought about it , and I came up with one .
I &apos;ve been doing it for the last year , and it &apos;s great .
It &apos;s called weekday veg .
The name says it all : Nothing with a face Monday through Friday .
On the weekend , your choice .
Simple .
If you want to take it to the next level , remember , the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats .
So you want to swap those out with some good , sustainably harvested fish .
It &apos;s structured , so it ends up being simple to remember , and it &apos;s okay to break it here and there .
After all , cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake .
The program has been great , weekday veg .
My footprint &apos;s smaller , I &apos;m lessening pollution , I feel better about the animals , I &apos;m even saving money .
Best of all , I &apos;m healthier , I know that I &apos;m going to live longer , and I &apos;ve even lost a little weight .
So , please ask yourselves , for your health , for your pocketbook , for the environment , for the animals : What &apos;s stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot ?
After all , if all of us ate half as much meat , it would be like half of us were vegetarians .
Thank you .
Taryn Simon : Photographs of secret sites
Taryn Simon exhibits her startling take on photography -- to reveal worlds and people we would never see otherwise . She shares two projects : one documents otherworldly locations typically kept secret from the public , the other involves haunting portraits of men convicted for crimes they did not commit .
Okay , so 90 percent of my photographic process is , in fact , not photographic .
It involves a campaign of letter writing , research and phone calls to access my subjects , which can range from Hamas leaders in Gaza to a hibernating black bear in its cave in West Virginia .
And oddly , the most notable letter of rejection I ever received came from Walt Disney World , a seemingly innocuous site .
And it read -- I &apos;m just going to read a key sentence : &quot; Especially during these violent times , I personally believe that the magical spell cast upon guests who visit our theme parks is particularly important to protect and helps to provide them with an important fantasy they can escape to . &quot;
Photography threatens fantasy .
They didn &apos;t want to let my camera in because it confronts constructed realities , myths and beliefs , and provides what appears to be evidence of a truth .
But there are multiple truths attached to every image , depending on the creator &apos;s intention , the viewer and the context in which it is presented .
Over a five year period following September 11th , when the American media and government were seeking hidden and unknown sites beyond its borders , most notably weapons of mass destruction , I chose to look inward at that which was integral to America &apos;s foundation , mythology and daily functioning .
I wanted to confront the boundaries of the citizen , self-imposed and real , and confront the divide between privileged and public access to knowledge .
It was a critical moment in American history and global history where one felt they didn &apos;t have access to accurate information .
And I wanted to see the center with my own eyes , but what I came away with is a photograph .
And it &apos;s just another place from which to observe , and the understanding that there are no absolute , all-knowing insiders .
And the outsider can never really reach the core .
I &apos;m going to run through some of the photographs in this series .
It &apos;s titled , &quot; An American Index of the Hidden and Unfamiliar , &quot; and it &apos;s comprised of nearly 70 images .
In this context I &apos;ll just show you a few .
This is a nuclear waste storage and encapsulation facility at Hanford site in Washington State , where there are over 1,900 stainless steel capsules containing nuclear waste submerged in water .
A human standing in front of an unprotected capsule would die instantly .
And I found one section amongst all of these that actually resembled the outline of the United States of America , which you can see here .
And a big part of the work that is sort of absent in this context is text .
So I create these two poles .
Every image is accompanied with a very detailed factual text .
And what I &apos;m most interested in is the invisible space between a text and its accompanying image , and how the image is transformed by the text and the text by the image .
So , at best , the image is meant to float away into abstraction and multiple truths and fantasy .
And then the text functions as this cruel anchor that kind of nails it to the ground .
But in this context I &apos;m just going to read an abridged version of those texts .
This is a cryopreservation unit , and it holds the bodies of the wife and mother of cryonics pioneer Robert Ettinger , who hoped to be awoken one day to extended life in good health , with advancements in science and technology , all for the cost of 35 thousand dollars , for forever .
This is a 21-year-old Palestinian woman undergoing hymenoplasty .
Hymenoplasty is a surgical procedure which restores the virginal state , allowing her to adhere to certain cultural expectations regarding virginity and marriage .
So it essentially reconstructs a ruptured hymen , allowing her to bleed upon having sexual intercourse , to simulate the loss of virginity .
This is a jury simulation deliberation room , and you can see beyond that two-way mirror jury advisers standing in a room behind the mirror .
And they observe deliberations after mock trial proceedings so that they can better advise their clients how to adjust their trial strategy to have the outcome that they &apos;re hoping for .
This process costs 60,000 dollars .
This is a U.S. Customs and Border Protection room , a contraband room , at John F. Kennedy International Airport .
On that table you can see 48 hours &apos; worth of seized goods from passengers entering in to the United States .
There is a pig &apos;s head and African cane rats .
And part of my photographic work is I &apos;m not just documenting what &apos;s there .
I do take certain liberties and intervene .
And in this I really wanted it to resemble an early still-life painting , so I spent some time with the smells and items .
This is the exhibited art on the walls of the CIA in Langley , Virginia , their original headquarters building .
And the CIA has had a long history with both covert and public cultural diplomacy efforts .
And it &apos;s speculated that some of their interest in the arts was designed to counter Soviet communism and promote what it considered to be pro-American thoughts and aesthetics .
And one of the art forms that elicited the interest of the agency , and had thus come under question , is abstract expressionism .
This is the Forensic Anthropology Research Facility , and on a six acre plot there are approximately 75 cadavers at any given time that are being studied by forensic anthropologists and researchers who are interested in monitoring a rate of corpse decomposition .
And in this particular photograph the body of a young boy has been used to reenact a crime scene .
This is the only federally funded site where it is legal to cultivate cannabis for scientific research in the United States .
It &apos;s a research crop marijuana grow room .
And part of the work that I hope for is that there is a sort of disorienting entropy where you can &apos;t find any discernible formula in how these things -- they sort of awkwardly jump from government to science to religion to security -- and you can &apos;t completely understand how information is being distributed .
These are transatlantic submarine communication cables that travel across the floor of the Atlantic Ocean , connecting North America to Europe .
They carry over 60 million simultaneous voice conversations , and in a lot of the government and technology sites there was just this very apparent vulnerability .
This one is almost humorous because it feels like I could just snip all of that conversation in one easy cut .
But stuff did feel like it could have been taken 30 or 40 years ago , like it was locked in the Cold War era and hadn &apos;t necessarily progressed .
This is a Braille edition of Playboy magazine .
And this is ... a division of the Library of Congress produces a free national library service for the blind and visually impaired , and the publications they choose to publish are based on reader popularity .
And Playboy is always in the top few .
But you &apos;d be surprised , they don &apos;t do the photographs . It &apos;s just the text .
This is an avian quarantine facility where all imported birds coming into America are required to undergo a 30-day quarantine , where they are tested for diseases including Exotic Newcastle Disease and Avian Influenza .
This film shows the testing of a new explosive fill on a warhead .
And the Air Armament Center at Eglin Air Force Base in Florida is responsible for the deployment and testing of all air-delivered weaponry coming from the United States .
And the film was shot on 72 millimeter , government-issue film .
And that red dot is a marking on the government-issue film .
All living white tigers in North America are the result of selective inbreeding -- that would be mother to son , father to daughter , sister to brother -- to allow for the genetic conditions that create a salable white tiger .
Meaning white fur , ice blue eyes , a pink nose .
And the majority of these white tigers are not born in a salable state and are killed at birth .
It &apos;s a very violent process that is little known .
And the white tiger is obviously celebrated in several forms of entertainment .
Kenny was born . He actually made it to adulthood .
He has since passed away , but was mentally retarded and suffers from severe bone abnormalities .
This , on a lighter note , is at George Lucas &apos; personal archive .
This is the Death Star .
And it &apos;s shown here in its true orientation .
In the context of &quot; Star Wars : Return of the Jedi , &quot; its mirror image is presented .
They flip the negative .
And you can see the photoetched brass detailing , and the painted acrylic facade .
In the context of the film , this is a deep-space battle station of the Galactic Empire , capable of annihilating planets and civilizations , and in reality it measures about four feet by two feet .
This is at Fort Campbell in Kentucky .
It &apos;s a Military Operations on Urbanized Terrain site .
Essentially they &apos;ve simulated a city for urban combat , and this is one of the structures that exists in that city .
It &apos;s called the World Church of God .
It &apos;s supposed to be a generic site of worship .
And after I took this photograph , they constructed a wall around the World Church of God to mimic the set-up of mosques in Afghanistan or Iraq .
And I worked with Mehta Vihar who creates virtual simulations for the army for tactical practice .
And we put that wall around the World Church of God , and also used the characters and vehicles and explosions that are offered in the video games for the army .
And I put them into my photograph .
This is live HIV virus at Harvard Medical School , who is working with the U.S. Government to develop sterilizing immunity .
And Alhurra is a U.S. Government- sponsored Arabic language television network that distributes news and information to over 22 countries in the Arab world .
It runs 24 hours a day , commercial free .
However , it &apos;s illegal to broadcast Alhurra within the United States .
And in 2004 , they developed a channel called Alhurra Iraq , which specifically deals with events occurring in Iraq and is broadcast to Iraq .
Now I &apos;m going to move on to another project I did .
It &apos;s titled &quot; The Innocents . &quot;
And for the men in these photographs , photography had been used to create a fantasy .
Contradicting its function as evidence of a truth , in these instances it furthered the fabrication of a lie .
I traveled across the United States photographing men and women who had been wrongfully convicted of crimes they did not commit , violent crimes .
I investigate photography &apos;s ability to blur truth and fiction , and its influence on memory , which can lead to severe , even lethal consequences .
For the men in these photographs , the primary cause of their wrongful conviction was mistaken identification .
A victim or eyewitness identifies a suspected perpetrator through law enforcement &apos;s use of images .
But through exposure to composite sketches , Polaroids , mug shots and line-ups , eyewitness testimony can change .
I &apos;ll give you an example from a case .
A woman was raped and presented with a series of photographs from which to identify her attacker .
She saw some similarities in one of the photographs , but couldn &apos;t quite make a positive identification .
Days later , she is presented with another photo array of all new photographs , except that one photograph that she had some draw to from the earlier array is repeated in the second array .
And a positive identification is made because the photograph replaced the memory , if there ever was an actual memory .
Photography offered the criminal justice system a tool that transformed innocent citizens into criminals , and the criminal justice system failed to recognize the limitations of relying on photographic identifications .
Frederick Daye , who is photographed at his alibi location , where 13 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime .
He was convicted by an all-white jury of rape , kidnapping and vehicle theft .
And he served 10 years of a life sentence .
Now DNA exonerated Frederick and it also implicated another man who was serving time in prison .
But the victim refused to press charges because she claimed that law enforcement had permanently altered her memory through the use of Frederick &apos;s photograph .
Charles Fain was convicted of kidnapping , rape and murder of a young girl walking to school .
He served 18 years of a death sentence .
I photographed him at the scene of the crime at the Snake River in Idaho .
And I photographed all of the wrongfully convicted at sites that came to particular significance in the history of their wrongful conviction .
The scene of arrest , the scene of misidentification , the alibi location .
And here , the scene of the crime , it &apos;s this place to which he &apos;s never been , but changed his life forever .
So photographing there , I was hoping to highlight the tenuous relationship between truth and fiction , in both his life and in photography .
Calvin Washington was convicted of capital murder .
He served 13 years of a life sentence in Waco , Texas .
Larry Mayes , I photographed at the scene of arrest , where he hid between two mattresses in Gary , Indiana , in this very room to hide from the police .
He ended up serving 18 and a half years of an 80 year sentence for rape and robbery .
The victim failed to identify Larry in two live lineups and then made a positive identification , days later , from a photo array .
Larry Youngblood served eight years of a 10 and half year sentence in Arizona for the abduction and repeated sodomizing of a 10 year old boy at a carnival .
He is photographed at his alibi location .
Ron Williamson . Ron was convicted of the rape and murder of a barmaid at a club , and served 11 years of a death sentence .
I photographed Ron at a baseball field because he had been drafted to the Oakland A &apos;s to play professional baseball just before his conviction .
And the state &apos;s key witness in Ron &apos;s case was , in the end , the actual perpetrator .
Ronald Jones served eight years of a death sentence for rape and murder of a 28-year-old woman .
I photographed him at the scene of arrest in Chicago .
William Gregory was convicted of rape and burglary .
He served seven years of a 70 year sentence in Kentucky .
Timothy Durham , who I photographed at his alibi location where 11 witnesses placed him at the time of the crime , was convicted of 3.5 years of a 3220 year sentence , for several charges of rape and robbery .
He had been misidentified by an 11-year-old victim .
Troy Webb is photographed here at the scene of the crime in Virginia .
He was convicted of rape , kidnapping and robbery , and served seven years of a 47 year sentence .
Troy &apos;s picture was in a photo array that the victim tentatively had some draw toward , but said he looked too old .
The police went and found a photograph of Troy Webb from four years earlier , which they entered into a photo array days later , and he was positively identified .
Now I &apos;m going to leave you with a self portrait .
And it reiterates that distortion is a constant , and our eyes are easily deceived .
That &apos;s it . Thank you .
Ed Boyden : A light switch for neurons
Ed Boyden shows how , by inserting genes for light-sensitive proteins into brain cells , he can selectively activate or de-activate specific neurons with fiber-optic implants . With this unprecedented level of control , he &apos;s managed to cure mice of analogs of PTSD and certain forms of blindness . On the horizon : neural prosthetics . Session host Juan Enriquez leads a brief post-talk Q &amp; amp ; A.
Think about your day for a second .
You woke up , felt fresh air on your face as you walked out the door , encountered new colleagues and had great discussions , and felt in awe when you found something new .
But I bet there &apos;s something you didn &apos;t think about today -- something so close to home that you probably don &apos;t think about it very often at all .
And that &apos;s that all the sensations , feelings , decisions and actions are mediated by the computer in your head called the brain .
Now the brain may not look like much from the outside -- a couple pounds of pinkish-gray flesh , amorphous -- but the last hundred years of neuroscience have allowed us to zoom in on the brain , and to see the intricacy of what lies within .
And they &apos;ve told us that this brain is an incredibly complicated circuit made out of hundreds of billions of cells called neurons .
Now unlike a human-designed computer , where there &apos;s a fairly small number of different parts -- we know how they work , because we humans designed them -- the brain is made out of thousands of different kinds of cells , maybe tens of thousands .
They come in different shapes ; they &apos;re made out of different molecules .
And they project and connect to different brain regions , and they also change different ways in different disease states .
Let &apos;s make it concrete .
There &apos;s a class of cells , a fairly small cell , an inhibitory cell , that quiets its neighbors .
It &apos;s one of the cells that seems to be atrophied in disorders like schizophrenia .
It &apos;s called the basket cell .
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
New ones are being discovered everyday .
As just a second example : these pyramidal cells , large cells , they can span a significant fraction of the brain .
They &apos;re excitatory .
And these are some of the cells that might be overactive in disorders such as epilepsy .
Every one of these cells is an incredible electrical device .
They receive input from thousands of upstream partners and compute their own electrical outputs , which then , if they pass a certain threshold , will go to thousands of downstream partners .
And this process , which takes just a millisecond or so , happens thousands of times a minute in every one of your 100 billion cells , as long as you live and think and feel .
So how are we going to figure out what this circuit does ?
Ideally , we could go through the circuit and turn these different kinds of cell on and off and see whether we could figure out which ones contribute to certain functions and which ones go wrong in certain pathologies .
If we could activate cells , we could see what powers they can unleash , what they can initiate and sustain .
If we could turn them off , then we could try and figure out what they &apos;re necessary for .
And that &apos;s a story I &apos;m going to tell you about today .
And honestly , where we &apos;ve gone through over the last 11 years , through an attempt to find ways of turning circuits and cells and parts and pathways of the brain on and off , both to understand the science and also to confront some of the issues that face us all as humans .
Now before I tell you about the technology , the bad news is that a significant fraction of us in this room , if we live long enough , will encounter , perhaps , a brain disorder .
Already , a billion people have had some kind of brain disorder that incapacitates them , and the numbers don &apos;t do it justice though .
These disorders -- schizophrenia , Alzheimer &apos;s , depression , addiction -- they not only steal our time to live , they change who we are .
They take our identity and change our emotions and change who we are as people .
Now in the 20th century , there was some hope that was generated through the development of pharmaceuticals for treating brain disorders , and while many drugs have been developed that can alleviate symptoms of brain disorders , practically none of them can be considered to be cured .
And part of that &apos;s because we &apos;re bathing the brain in the chemical .
This elaborate circuit made out of thousands of different kinds of cell is being bathed in a substance .
That &apos;s also why , perhaps , most of the drugs , and not all , on the market can present some kind of serious side effect too .
Now some people have gotten some solace from electrical stimulators that are implanted in the brain .
And for Parkinson &apos;s disease , Cochlear implants , these have indeed been able to bring some kind of remedy to people with certain kinds of disorder .
But electricity also will go in all directions -- the path of least resistance , which is where that phrase , in part , comes from .
And it also will affect normal circuits as well as the abnormal ones that you want to fix .
So again , we &apos;re sent back to the idea of ultra-precise control .
Could we dial-in information precisely where we want it to go ?
So when I started in neuroscience 11 years ago , I had trained as an electrical engineer and a physicist , and the first thing I thought about was , if these neurons are electrical devices , all we need to do is to find some way of driving those electrical changes at a distance .
If we could turn on the electricity in one cell , but not its neighbors , that would give us the tool we need to activate and shut down these different cells , figure out what they do and how they contribute to the networks in which they &apos;re embedded .
And also it would allow us to have the ultra-precise control we need in order to fix the circuit computations that have gone awry .
Now how are we going to do that ?
Well there are many molecules that exist in nature , which are able to convert light into electricity .
You can think of them as little proteins that are like solar cells .
If we can install these molecules in neurons somehow , then these neurons would become electrically drivable with light .
And their neighbors , which don &apos;t have the molecule , would not .
There &apos;s one other magic trick you need to make this all happen , and that &apos;s the ability to get light into the brain .
And to do that -- the brain doesn &apos;t feel pain -- you can put -- taking advantage of all the effort that &apos;s gone into the Internet and communications and so on -- optical fibers connected to lasers that you can use to activate , in animal models for example , in pre-clinical studies , these neurons and to see what they do .
So how do we do this ?
Around 2004 , in collaboration with Gerhard Nagel and Karl Deisseroth , this vision came to fruition .
There &apos;s a certain alga that swims in the wild , and it needs to navigate towards light in order to photosynthesize optimally .
And it senses light with a little eye-spot , which works not unlike how our eye works .
In its membrane , or its boundary , it contains little proteins that indeed can convert light into electricity .
So these molecules are called channelrhodopsins .
And each of these proteins acts just like that solar cell that I told you about .
When blue light hits it , it opens up a little hole and allows charged particles to enter the eye-spot , and that allows this eye-spot to have an electrical signal just like a solar cell charging up a battery .
So what we need to do is to take these molecules and somehow install them in neurons .
And because it &apos;s a protein , it &apos;s encoded for in the DNA of this organism .
So all we &apos;ve got to do is take that DNA , put it into a gene therapy vector , like a virus , and put it into neurons .
So it turned out that this was a very productive time in gene therapy , and lots of viruses were coming along .
So this turned out to be very simple to do .
And early in the morning one day in the summer of 2004 , we gave it a try , and it worked on the first try .
You take this DNA and you put it into a neuron .
The neuron uses its natural protein-making machinery to fabricate these little light-sensitive proteins and install them all over the cell , like putting solar panels on a roof , and the next thing you know , you have a neuron which can be activated with light .
So this is very powerful .
One of the tricks you have to do is to figure out how to deliver these genes to the cells that you want and not all the other neighbors .
And you can do that ; you can tweak the viruses so they hit just some cells and not others .
And there &apos;s other genetic tricks you can play in order to get light-activated cells .
This field has now come to be known as optogenetics .
And just as one example of the kind of thing you can do , you can take a complex network , use one of these viruses to deliver the gene just to one kind of cell in this dense network .
And then when you shine light on the entire network , just that cell type will be activated .
So for example , lets sort of consider that basket cell I told you about earlier -- the one that &apos;s atrophied in schizophrenia and the one that is inhibitory .
If we can deliver that gene to these cells -- and they &apos;re not going to be altered by the expression of the gene , of course -- and then flash blue light over the entire brain network , just these cells are going to be driven .
And when the light turns off , these cells go back to normal , so they don &apos;t seem to be averse against that .
Not only can you use this to study what these cells do , what their power is in computing in the brain , but you can also use this to try to figure out -- well maybe we could jazz up the activity of these cells , if indeed they &apos;re atrophied .
Now I want to tell you a couple of short stories about how we &apos;re using this , both at the scientific , clinical and pre-clinical levels .
One of the questions we &apos;ve confronted is , what are the signals in the brain that mediate the sensation of reward ?
Because if you could find those , those would be some of the signals that could drive learning .
The brain will do more of whatever got that reward .
And also these are signals that go awry in disorders such as addiction .
So if we could figure out what cells they are , we could maybe find new targets for which drugs could be designed or screened against , or maybe places where electrodes could be put in for people who have very severe disability .
So to do that , we came up with a very simple paradigm in collaboration with the Fiorella group , where one side of this little box , if the animal goes there , the animal gets a pulse of light in order to make different cells in the brain sensitive to light .
So if these cells can mediate reward , the animal should go there more and more .
And so that &apos;s what happens .
This animal &apos;s going to go to the right-hand side and poke his nose there , and he gets a flash of blue light every time he does that .
And he &apos;ll do that hundreds and hundreds of times .
These are the dopamine neurons , which some of you may have heard about , in some of the pleasure centers in the brain .
Now we &apos;ve shown that a brief activation of these is enough , indeed , to drive learning .
Now we can generalize the idea .
Instead of one point in the brain , we can devise devices that span the brain , that can deliver light into three-dimensional patterns -- arrays of optical fibers , each coupled to its own independent miniature light source .
And then we can try to do things in vivo that have only been done to-date in a dish -- like high-throughput screening throughout the entire brain for the signals that can cause certain things to happen .
Or that could be good clinical targets for treating brain disorders .
And one story I want to tell you about is how can we find targets for treating post-traumatic stress disorder -- a form of uncontrolled anxiety and fear .
And one of the things that we did was to adopt a very classical model of fear .
This goes back to the Pavlovian days .
It &apos;s called Pavlovian fear conditioning -- where a tone ends with a brief shock .
The shock isn &apos;t painful , but it &apos;s a little annoying .
And over time -- in this case , a mouse , which is a good animal model , commonly used in such experiments -- the animal learns to fear the tone .
The animal will react by freezing , sort of like a deer in the headlights .
Now the question is , what targets in the brain can we find that allow us to overcome this fear ?
So what we do is we play that tone again after it &apos;s been associated with fear .
But we activate targets in the brain , different ones , using that optical fiber array I told you about in the previous slide , in order to try and figure out which targets can cause the brain to overcome that memory of fear .
And so this brief video shows you one of these targets that we &apos;re working on now .
This is an area in the prefrontal cortex , a region where we can use cognition to try to overcome aversive emotional states .
And the animal &apos;s going to hear a tone -- and a flash of light occurred there .
There &apos;s no audio on this , but you can see the animal &apos;s freezing .
This tone used to mean bad news .
And there &apos;s a little clock in the lower left-hand corner , so you can see the animal is about two minutes into this .
And now this next clip is just eight minutes later .
And the same tone is going to play , and the light is going to flash again .
Okay , there it goes . Right now .
And now you can see , just 10 minutes into the experiment , that we &apos;ve equipped the brain by photoactivating this area to overcome the expression of this fear memory .
Now over the last couple of years , we &apos;ve gone back to the tree of life because we wanted to find ways to turn circuits in the brain off .
If we could do that , this could be extremely powerful .
If you can delete cells just for a few milliseconds or seconds , you can figure out what necessary role they play in the circuits in which they &apos;re embedded .
And we &apos;ve now surveyed organisms from all over the tree of life -- every kingdom of life except for animals , we see slightly differently .
And we found all sorts of molecules , they &apos;re called halorhodopsins or archaerhodopsins , that respond to green and yellow light .
And they do the opposite thing of the molecule I told you about before with the blue light activator channelrhodopsin .
Let &apos;s give an example of where we think this is going to go .
Consider , for example , a condition like epilepsy , where the brain is overactive .
Now if drugs fail in epileptic treatment , one of the strategies is to remove part of the brain .
But that &apos;s obviously irreversible , and there could be side effects .
What if we could just turn off that brain for a brief amount of time , until the seizure dies away , and cause the brain to be restored to its initial state -- sort of like a dynamical system that &apos;s being coaxed down into a stable state .
So this animation just tries to explain this concept where we made these cells sensitive to being turned off with light , and we beam light in , and just for the time it takes to shut down a seizure , we &apos;re hoping to be able to turn it off .
And so we don &apos;t have data to show you on this front , but we &apos;re very excited about this .
Now I want to close on one story , which we think is another possibility -- which is that maybe these molecules , if you can do ultra-precise control , can be used in the brain itself to make a new kind of prosthetic , an optical prosthetic .
I already told you that electrical stimulators are not uncommon .
Seventy-five thousand people have Parkinson &apos;s deep-brain stimulators implanted .
Maybe 100,000 people have Cochlear implants , which allow them to hear .
There &apos;s another thing , which is you &apos;ve got to get these genes into cells .
And new hope in gene therapy has been developed because viruses like the adeno-associated virus , which probably most of us around this room have , and it doesn &apos;t have any symptoms , which have been used in hundreds of patients to deliver genes into the brain or the body .
And so far , there have not been serious adverse events associated with the virus .
There &apos;s one last elephant in the room , the proteins themselves , which come from algae and bacteria and fungi , and all over the tree of life .
Most of us don &apos;t have fungi or algae in our brains , so what is our brain going to do if we put that in ?
Are the cells going to tolerate it ? Will the immune system react ?
In its early days -- these have not been done on humans yet -- but we &apos;re working on a variety of studies to try and examine this , and so far we haven &apos;t seen overt reactions of any severity to these molecules or to the illumination of the brain with light .
So it &apos;s early days , to be upfront , but we &apos;re excited about it .
I wanted to close with one story , which we think could potentially be a clinical application .
Now there are many forms of blindness where the photoreceptors , our light sensors that are in the back of our eye , are gone .
And the retina , of course , is a complex structure .
Now let &apos;s zoom in on it here , so we can see it in more detail .
The photoreceptor cells are shown here at the top , and then the signals that are detected by the photoreceptors are transformed by various computations until finally that layer of cells at the bottom , the ganglion cells , relay the information to the brain , where we see that as perception .
In many forms of blindness , like retinitis pigmentosa , or macular degeneration , the photoreceptor cells have atrophied or been destroyed .
Now how could you repair this ?
It &apos;s not even clear that a drug could cause this to be restored , because there &apos;s nothing for the drug to bind to .
On the other hand , light can still get into the eye .
The eye is still transparent and you can get light in .
So what if we could just take these channelrhodopsins and other molecules and install them on some of these other spare cells and convert them into little cameras .
And because there &apos;s so many of these cells in the eye , potentially , they could be very high-resolution cameras .
So this is some work that we &apos;re doing .
It &apos;s being led by one of our collaborators , Alan Horsager at USC , and being sought to be commercialized by a start-up company Eos Neuroscience , which is funded by the NIH .
And what you see here is a mouse trying to solve a maze .
It &apos;s a six-arm maze . And there &apos;s a bit of water in the maze to motivate the mouse to move , or he &apos;ll just sit there .
And the goal , of course , of this maze is to get out of the water and go to a little platform that &apos;s under the lit top port .
Now mice are smart , so this mouse solves the maze eventually , but he does a brute-force search .
He &apos;s swimming down every avenue until he finally gets to the platform .
So he &apos;s not using vision to do it .
These different mice are different mutations that recapitulate different kinds of blindness that affect humans .
And so we &apos;re being careful in trying to look at these different models so we come up with a generalized approach .
So how are we going to solve this ?
We &apos;re going to do exactly what we outlined in the previous slide .
We &apos;re going to take these blue light photosensors and install them on a layer of cells in the middle of the retina in the back of the eye and convert them into a camera -- just like installing solar cells all over those neurons to make them light sensitive .
Light is converted to electricity on them .
So this mouse was blind a couple weeks before this experiment and received one dose of this photosensitive molecule in a virus .
And now you can see , the animal can indeed avoid walls and go to this little platform and make cognitive use of its eyes again .
And to point out the power of this : these animals are able to get to that platform So this pre-clinical study , I think , bodes hope for the kinds of things we &apos;re hoping to do in the future .
To close , I want to point out that we &apos;re also exploring new business models for this new field of neurotechnology .
We &apos;re developing these tools , but we share them freely with hundreds of groups all over the world , so people can study and try to treat different disorders .
And our hope is that , by figuring out brain circuits at a level of abstraction that lets us repair them and engineer them , we can take some of these intractable disorders that I told you about earlier , practically none of which are cured , and in the 21st century make them history .
Thank you .
Juan Enriquez : So some of the stuff is a little dense .
But the implications of being able to control seizures or epilepsy with light instead of drugs , and being able to target those specifically is a first step .
The second thing that I think I heard you say is you can now control the brain in two colors , like an on / off switch .
Ed Boyden : That &apos;s right .
JE : Which makes every impulse going through the brain a binary code .
Right , yeah .
So with blue light , we can drive information , and it &apos;s in the form of a one .
And by turning things off , it &apos;s more or less a zero .
So our hope is to eventually build brain coprocessors that work with the brain so we can augment functions in people with disabilities .
JE : And in theory , that means that , as a mouse feels , smells , hears , touches , you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros .
Sure , yeah . We &apos;re hoping to use this as a way of testing what neural codes can drive certain behaviors and certain thoughts and certain feelings , and use that to understand more about the brain .
JE : Does that mean that some day you could download memories and maybe upload them ?
Well that &apos;s something we &apos;re starting to work on very hard .
We &apos;re now working on some work where we &apos;re trying to tile the brain with recording elements too .
So we can record information and then drive information back in -- sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing .
JE : Well , that might change a couple things . Thank you .
Ueli Gegenschatz : Extreme wingsuit flying
Wingsuit jumping is the leading edge of extreme sports -- an exhilarating feat of almost unbelievable daring , where skydivers soar through canyons at over 100MPH . Ueli Gegenschatz talks about how he does it , and shows jawdropping film .
I started with paragliding .
Paragliding is taking off from mountains with a paraglider , with the possibility to fly cross-country , distance , just with the use of thermals to soar .
Also different aerobatic maneuvers are possible with a paraglider .
From there I started with skydiving .
In this picture you can see there is a four-way skydive , four people flying together , and on the left hand side it &apos;s the camera flier with the camera mounted to his helmet so he can film the whole jump , for the film itself and also for the judging .
From regular , relative skydiving I went on to freeflying .
Freeflying is more the three-dimensional skydiving .
You can see the skydiver with the red suit , he &apos;s in a stand-up position .
The one with the yellow-green suit , he &apos;s flying head-down .
And that &apos;s me in the background , carving around the whole formation in freefall also , with the helmet cam to film this jump .
From freeflying I went on to skysurfing .
Skysurfing is skydiving with a board on the feet .
You can imagine with this big surface of a skysurfing board , there is a lot of force , a lot of power .
Of course I can use this power for example for nice spinning -- we call it &quot; helicopter moves . &quot;
From there I went on to wingsuit flying .
Wingsuit flying is a suit , that I can make fly , just only with my body .
If I put some tension on my body , tension on my suit , I can make it fly . And as you see the fall rate is much much slower because of the bigger surface .
With a proper body position I &apos;m able to really move forward to gain quite some distance .
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro .
You can see the Copacabana on the left-hand side .
From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving , I went on to BASE jumping .
BASE jumping is skydiving from fixed objects , like buildings , antennae , bridges and earth -- meaning mountains , cliffs .
of being in free fall , with all the visual references .
So my goal soon was to discover new places that nobody had jumped before .
So in summer 2000 I was the first to BASE jump the Eiger North Face in Switzerland .
Two years after this , I was the first to BASE jump from Matterhorn , a very famous mountain that probably everybody knows in here .
2005 I did a BASE jump from the Eiger , from the Monk and from the Jungfrau , three very famous mountains in Switzerland .
The special thing on these three jumps were , I hiked them all and climbed them all in only one day .
In 2008 I jumped the Eiffel Tower in Paris .
So with all this knowledge , I also wanted to get into stunts .
So with some friends we started to do different tricks , like for example this jump here , I jumped from a paraglider .
Or here -- everybody was freezing , pretty much , except me , because it was very cold in Austria where we did this filming .
Everybody sitting in a basket , and I was on top of the balloon , ready to slide down with my skysurf board .
Or this jump , from a moving truck on the highway .
Extreme sports on top level like this is only possible if you practice step by step , if you really work hard on your skills and on your knowledge .
Of course you need to be in physical , very good , condition , so I &apos;m training a lot .
You need to have the best possible equipment .
And probably the most important is you have to work on your mental skills , mental preparation .
And all this to come as close as possible to the human dream of being able to fly .
So for 2009 , I &apos;m training hard for my two new projects .
The first one , I want to set a world record in flying from a cliff with my wingsuit .
And I want to set a new record , with the longest distance ever flown .
For my second project , I have a sensational idea of a jump that never has been done before .
So now , on the following movie you will see that I &apos;m much better in flying a wingsuit than speaking in English .
Enjoy , and thank you very much .
I have some questions .
I think we all might have some questions .
Question one : so does that actually feel the way the flying dream does ?
Because it looks like it might .
Ueli Gegenschatz : Pretty much . I believe this is probably the closest possibility to come to the dream of being able to fly .
I know the answer to this , but how do you land ?
UE : Parachute . We have to open a parachute just seconds before , I would say , impact .
It &apos;s not possible to land a wingsuit yet .
Yet . But people are trying . Are you among those -- you &apos;re not going to commit -- are you among those trying to do it ?
UE : It &apos;s a dream . It &apos;s a dream . Yeah .
We &apos;re still working on it and we &apos;re developing the wingsuits to get better performance , to get more knowledge .
And I believe soon .
All right . Well we will watch this space . But I have two more questions .
What is the -- there was exhaust coming out of the back of the wingsuit . Was that a propelled wingsuit that you were wearing ?
UE : Nope . It &apos;s just smoke .
Coming off of you ?
UE : Hopefully not .
That seems dangerous .
UE : No , smoke is for two reasons , you can see the speed , you can see the way where I was flying .
That &apos;s reason number one . And reason number two : it &apos;s much easier for the camera guy to film If I &apos;m using smoke .
Ah , I see . So the wingsuit is set up to deliberately release smoke so that you can be tracked . One more question .
What do you do to to cover your face ?
Because I just keep thinking of going that fast and having your whole face smushed backwards .
Are you in a helmet ? Are you in goggles ?
UE : The purest and the best feeling would be with only goggles .
And is that how you usually fly ?
UE : Usually I &apos;m wearing a helmet . In the mountains I &apos;m always wearing a helmet because of landings -- usually it &apos;s difficult -- it &apos;s not like regular skydiving where you have like the big landings .
So you have to be prepared .
Right . Now is there anything you don &apos;t do ?
Do people come to you with projects and say , &quot; We want you to do this ! &quot;
and do you ever say , &quot; No , no I &apos;m not going to . &quot;
UE : Oh of course , of course . Some people have crazy ideas and -- ... a round of applause ...
UE : Thank you very much .
Amanda Palmer : The art of asking
Don &apos;t make people pay for music , says Amanda Palmer : Let them . In a passionate talk that begins in her days as a street performer , she examines the new relationship between artist and fan .
So I didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
For about the five years after graduating from an upstanding liberal arts university , this was my day job .
I was a self-employed living statue called the 8-Foot Bride , and I love telling people l did this for a job , because everybody always wants to know , who are these freaks in real life ?
Hello .
I painted myself white one day , stood on a box , put a hat or a can at my feet , and when someone came by and dropped in money , I handed them a flower and some intense eye contact .
And if they didn &apos;t take the flower , I threw in a gesture of sadness and longing as they walked away .
So I had the most profound encounters with people , especially lonely people who looked like they hadn &apos;t talked to anyone in weeks , and we would get this beautiful moment of prolonged eye contact being allowed in a city street , and we would sort of fall in love a little bit .
And my eyes would say , &quot; Thank you . I see you . &quot;
And their eyes would say , &quot; Nobody ever sees me . Thank you . &quot;
And I would get harassed sometimes .
People would yell at me from their passing cars .
&quot; Get a job ! &quot;
And I &apos;d be , like , &quot; This is my job . &quot;
But it hurt , because it made me fear that I was somehow doing something un-joblike and unfair , shameful .
I had no idea how perfect a real education I was getting for the music business on this box .
And for the economists out there , you may be interested to know I actually made a pretty predictable income , which was shocking to me given I had no regular customers , but pretty much 60 bucks on a Tuesday , 90 bucks on a Friday .
It was consistent .
And meanwhile , I was touring locally and playing in nightclubs with my band , the Dresden Dolls .
This was me on piano , a genius drummer .
I wrote the songs , and eventually we started making enough money that I could quit being a statue , and as we started touring , I really didn &apos;t want to lose this sense of direct connection with people , because I loved it .
So after all of our shows , we would sign autographs and hug fans and hang out and talk to people , and we made an art out of asking people to help us and join us , and I would track down local musicians and artists and they would set up outside of our shows , and they would pass the hat , and then they would come in and join us onstage , so we had this rotating smorgasbord of weird , random circus guests .
And then Twitter came along , and made things even more magic , because I could ask instantly for anything anywhere .
So I would need a piano to practice on , and an hour later I would be at a fan &apos;s house . This is in London .
People would bring home-cooked food to us all over the world backstage and feed us and eat with us . This is in Seattle .
Fans who worked in museums and stores and any kind of public space would wave their hands if I would decide to do a last-minute , spontaneous , free gig .
This is a library in Auckland .
On Saturday I tweeted for this crate and hat , because I did not want to schlep them from the East Coast , and they showed up care of this dude , Chris from Newport Beach , who says hello .
I once tweeted , where in Melbourne can I buy a neti pot ?
And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in , and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death .
And I love this kind of random closeness , which is lucky , because I do a lot of couchsurfing .
In mansions where everyone in my crew gets their own room but there &apos;s no wireless , and in punk squats , everyone on the floor in one room with no toilets but with wireless , clearly making it the better option .
My crew once pulled our van up to a really poor Miami neighborhood and we found out that our couchsurfing host for the night was an 18-year-old girl , still living at home , and her family were all undocumented immigrants from Honduras .
And that night , her whole family took the couches and she slept together with her mom so that we could take their beds .
And I lay there thinking , these people have so little .
Is this fair ?
And in the morning , her mom taught us how to try to make tortillas and wanted to give me a Bible , and she took me aside and she said to me in her broken English , &quot; Your music has helped my daughter so much .
Thank you for staying here . We &apos;re all so grateful . &quot;
And I thought , this is fair .
This is this .
A couple months later , I was in Manhattan , and I tweeted for a crash pad , and at midnight , I &apos;m ringing a doorbell on the Lower East Side , and it occurs to me I &apos;ve never actually done this alone .
I &apos;ve always been with my band or my crew .
Is this what stupid people do ?
Is this how stupid people die ?
And before I can change my mind , the door busts open .
She &apos;s an artist . He &apos;s a financial blogger for Reuters , and they &apos;re pouring me a glass of red wine and offering me a bath , and I have had thousands of nights like that and like that .
So I couchsurf a lot . I also crowdsurf a lot .
I maintain couchsurfing and crowdsurfing are basically the same thing .
You &apos;re falling into the audience and you &apos;re trusting each other .
I once asked an opening band of mine if they wanted to go out into the crowd and pass the hat to get themselves some extra money , something that I did a lot .
And as usual , the band was psyched , but there was this one guy in the band who told me he just couldn &apos;t bring himself to go out there .
It felt too much like begging to stand there with the hat .
And I recognized his fear of &quot; Is this fair ? &quot; and &quot; Get a job . &quot;
And meanwhile , my band is becoming bigger and bigger .
We signed with a major label .
And our music is a cross between punk and cabaret .
It &apos;s not for everybody .
Well , maybe it &apos;s for you .
We sign , and there &apos;s all this hype leading up to our next record .
And it comes out and it sells about 25,000 copies in the first few weeks , and the label considers this a failure .
And I was like , &quot; 25,000 , isn &apos;t that a lot ? &quot;
They were like , &quot; No , the sales are going down . It &apos;s a failure . &quot;
And they walk off .
Right at this same time , I &apos;m signing and hugging after a gig , and a guy comes up to me and hands me a $ 10 bill , and he says , &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I burned your CD from a friend . &quot;
&quot; But I read your blog , I know you hate your label .
I just want you to have this money . &quot;
And this starts happening all the time .
I become the hat after my own gigs , but I have to physically stand there and take the help from people , and unlike the guy in the opening band , I &apos;ve actually had a lot of practice standing there .
Thank you .
And this is the moment I decide I &apos;m just going to give away my music for free online whenever possible , so it &apos;s like Metallica over here , Napster , bad ; Amanda Palmer over here , and I &apos;m going to encourage torrenting , downloading , sharing , but I &apos;m going to ask for help , because I saw it work on the street .
So I fought my way off my label and for my next project with my new band , the Grand Theft Orchestra , I turned to crowdfunding , and I fell into those thousands of connections that I &apos;d made , and I asked my crowd to catch me .
And the goal was 100,000 dollars .
My fans backed me at nearly 1.2 million , which was the biggest music crowdfunding project to date .
And you can see how many people it is .
It &apos;s about 25,000 people .
And the media asked , &quot; Amanda , the music business is tanking and you encourage piracy .
How did you make all these people pay for music ? &quot;
And the real answer is , I didn &apos;t make them . I asked them .
And through the very act of asking people , I &apos;d connected with them , and when you connect with them , people want to help you .
It &apos;s kind of counterintuitive for a lot of artists .
They don &apos;t want to ask for things .
But it &apos;s not easy . It &apos;s not easy to ask .
And a lot of artists have a problem with this .
Asking makes you vulnerable .
And I got a lot of criticism online after my Kickstarter went big for continuing my crazy crowdsourcing practices , specifically for asking musicians who are fans if they wanted to join us on stage for a few songs in exchange for love and tickets and beer , and this was a doctored image that went up of me on a website .
And this hurt in a really familiar way .
And people saying , &quot; You &apos;re not allowed anymore to ask for that kind of help , &quot; really reminded me of the people in their cars yelling , &quot; Get a job . &quot;
Because they weren &apos;t with us on the sidewalk , and they couldn &apos;t see the exchange that was happening between me and my crowd , an exchange that was very fair to us but alien to them .
So this is slightly not safe for work .
This is my Kickstarter backer party in Berlin .
At the end of the night , I stripped and let everyone draw on me .
Now let me tell you , if you want to experience the visceral feeling of trusting strangers , I recommend this , especially if those strangers are drunk German people .
This was a ninja master-level fan connection , because what I was really saying here was , I trust you this much .
Should I ? Show me .
For most of human history , musicians , artists , they &apos;ve been part of the community , connectors and openers , not untouchable stars .
Celebrity is about a lot of people loving you from a distance , but the Internet and the content that we &apos;re freely able to share on it are taking us back .
It &apos;s about a few people loving you up close and about those people being enough .
So a lot of people are confused by the idea of no hard sticker price .
They see it as an unpredictable risk , but the things I &apos;ve done , the Kickstarter , the street , the doorbell , I don &apos;t see these things as risk .
I see them as trust .
Now , the online tools to make the exchange as easy and as instinctive as the street , they &apos;re getting there .
But the perfect tools aren &apos;t going to help us if we can &apos;t face each other and give and receive fearlessly , but , more important , to ask without shame .
My music career has been spent trying to encounter people on the Internet the way I could on the box , so blogging and tweeting not just about my tour dates and my new video but about our work and our art and our fears and our hangovers , our mistakes , and we see each other .
And I think when we really see each other , we want to help each other .
I think people have been obsessed with the wrong question , which is , &quot; How do we make people pay for music ? &quot;
What if we started asking , &quot; How do we let people pay for music ? &quot;
Thank you .
Mikko Hypponen : How the NSA betrayed the world &apos;s trust -- time to act
Recent events have highlighted , underlined and bolded the fact that the United States is performing blanket surveillance on any foreigner whose data passes through an American entity -- whether they are suspected of wrongdoing or not . This means that , essentially , every international user of the internet is being watched , says Mikko Hypponen . An important rant , wrapped with a plea : to find alternative solutions to using American companies for the world &apos;s information needs .
The two most likely largest inventions of our generation are the Internet and the mobile phone .
They &apos;ve changed the world .
However , largely to our surprise , they also turned out to be the perfect tools for the surveillance state .
It turned out that the capability to collect data , information and connections about basically any of us and all of us is exactly what we &apos;ve been hearing throughout of the summer through revelations and leaks about Western intelligence agencies , mostly U.S. intelligence agencies , watching over the rest of the world .
We &apos;ve heard about these starting with the revelations from June 6 .
Edward Snowden started leaking information , top secret classified information , from the U.S. intelligence agencies , and we started learning about things like PRISM and XKeyscore and others .
And these are examples of the kinds of programs U.S. intelligence agencies are running right now , against the whole rest of the world .
And if you look back about the forecasts on surveillance by George Orwell , well it turns out that George Orwell was an optimist .
We are right now seeing a much larger scale of tracking of individual citizens than he could have ever imagined .
And this here is the infamous NSA data center in Utah .
Due to be opened very soon , it will be both a supercomputing center and a data storage center .
You could basically imagine it has a large hall filled with hard drives storing data they are collecting .
And it &apos;s a pretty big building .
How big ? Well , I can give you the numbers -- 140,000 square meters -- but that doesn &apos;t really tell you very much .
Maybe it &apos;s better to imagine it as a comparison .
You think about the largest IKEA store you &apos;ve ever been in .
This is five times larger .
How many hard drives can you fit in an IKEA store ?
Right ? It &apos;s pretty big .
We estimate that just the electricity bill for running this data center is going to be in the tens of millions of dollars a year .
And this kind of wholesale surveillance means that they can collect our data and keep it basically forever , keep it for extended periods of time , keep it for years , keep it for decades .
And this opens up completely new kinds of risks to us all .
And what this is is that it is wholesale blanket surveillance on everyone .
Well , not exactly everyone , because the U.S. intelligence only has a legal right to monitor foreigners .
They can monitor foreigners when foreigners &apos; data connections end up in the United States or pass through the United States .
And monitoring foreigners doesn &apos;t sound too bad until you realize that I &apos;m a foreigner and you &apos;re a foreigner .
In fact , 96 percent of the planet are foreigners .
Right ?
So it is wholesale blanket surveillance of all of us , all of us who use telecommunications and the Internet .
But don &apos;t get me wrong : There are actually types of surveillance that are okay .
I love freedom , but even I agree that some surveillance is fine .
If the law enforcement is trying to find a murderer , or they &apos;re trying to catch a drug lord or trying to prevent a school shooting , and they have leads and they have suspects , then it &apos;s perfectly fine for them to tap the suspect &apos;s phone , and to intercept his Internet communications .
I &apos;m not arguing that at all , but that &apos;s not what programs like PRISM are about .
They are not about doing surveillance on people that they have reason to suspect of some wrongdoings .
They &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
So the four main arguments supporting surveillance like this , well , the first of all is that whenever you start discussing about these revelations , there will be naysayers trying to minimize the importance of these revelations , saying that we knew all this already , we knew it was happening , there &apos;s nothing new here .
And that &apos;s not true . Don &apos;t let anybody tell you that we knew this already , because we did not know this already .
Our worst fears might have been something like this , but we didn &apos;t know this was happening .
Now we know for a fact it &apos;s happening .
We didn &apos;t know about this . We didn &apos;t know about PRISM .
We didn &apos;t know about XKeyscore . We didn &apos;t know about Cybertrans .
We didn &apos;t know about DoubleArrow .
We did not know about Skywriter -- all these different programs run by U.S. intelligence agencies .
But now we do .
And we did not know that U.S. intelligence agencies go to extremes such as infiltrating standardization bodies to sabotage encryption algorithms on purpose .
And what that means is that you take something which is secure , an encryption algorithm which is so secure that if you use that algorithm to encrypt one file , nobody can decrypt that file .
Even if they take every single computer on the planet just to decrypt that one file , it &apos;s going to take millions of years .
So that &apos;s basically perfectly safe , uncrackable .
You take something which is that good and then you weaken it on purpose , making all of us less secure as an end result .
A real-world equivalent would be that intelligence agencies would force some secret pin code into every single house alarm so they could get into every single house because , you know , bad people might have house alarms , but it will also make all of us less secure as an end result .
Backdooring encryption algorithms just boggles the mind .
But of course , these intelligence agencies are doing their job .
This is what they have been told to do : do signals intelligence , monitor telecommunications , monitor Internet traffic .
That &apos;s what they &apos;re trying to do , and since most , a very big part of the Internet traffic today is encrypted , they &apos;re trying to find ways around the encryption .
One way is to sabotage encryption algorithms , which is a great example about how U.S. intelligence agencies are running loose .
They are completely out of control , and they should be brought back under control .
So what do we actually know about the leaks ?
Everything is based on the files leaked by Mr. Snowden .
The very first PRISM slides from the beginning of June detail a collection program where the data is collected from service providers , and they actually go and name the service providers they have access to .
They even have a specific date on when the collection of data began for each of the service providers .
So for example , they name the collection from Microsoft started on September 11 , 2007 , for Yahoo on the March 12 , 2008 , and then others : Google , Facebook , Skype , Apple and so on .
And every single one of these companies denies .
They all say that this simply isn &apos;t true , that they are not giving backdoor access to their data .
Yet we have these files .
So is one of the parties lying , or is there some other alternative explanation ?
And one explanation would be that these parties , these service providers , are not cooperating .
Instead , they &apos;ve been hacked .
That would explain it . They aren &apos;t cooperating . They &apos;ve been hacked .
In this case , they &apos;ve been hacked by their own government .
That might sound outlandish , but we already have cases where this has happened , for example , the case of the Flame malware which we strongly believe was authored by the U.S. government , and which , to spread , subverted the security of the Windows Update network , meaning here , the company was hacked by their own government .
And there &apos;s more evidence supporting this theory as well .
Der Spiegel , from Germany , leaked more information about the operations run by the elite hacker units operating inside these intelligence agencies .
Inside NSA , the unit is called TAO , Tailored Access Operations , and inside GCHQ , which is the U.K. equivalent , it &apos;s called NAC , Network Analysis Centre .
And these recent leaks of these three slides detail an operation run by this GCHQ intelligence agency from the United Kingdom targeting a telecom here in Belgium .
And what this really means is that an E.U. country &apos;s intelligence agency is breaching the security of a telecom of a fellow E.U. country on purpose , and they discuss it in their slides completely casually , business as usual .
Here &apos;s the primary target , here &apos;s the secondary target , here &apos;s the teaming .
They probably have a team building on Thursday evening in a pub .
They even use cheesy PowerPoint clip art like , you know , &quot; Success , &quot; when they gain access to services like this .
What the hell ?
And then there &apos;s the argument that okay , yes , this might be going on , but then again , other countries are doing it as well .
All countries spy .
And maybe that &apos;s true .
Many countries spy , not all of them , but let &apos;s take an example .
Let &apos;s take , for example , Sweden .
I &apos;m speaking of Sweden because Sweden has a little bit of a similar law to the United States .
When your data traffic goes through Sweden , their intelligence agency has a legal right by the law to intercept that traffic .
All right , how many Swedish decisionmakers and politicians and business leaders use , every day , U.S.-based services , like , you know , run Windows or OSX , or use Facebook or LinkedIn , or store their data in clouds like iCloud or Skydrive or DropBox , or maybe use online services like Amazon web services or sales support ?
And the answer is , every single Swedish business leader does that every single day .
And then we turn it around .
How many American leaders use Swedish webmails and cloud services ?
And the answer is zero .
So this is not balanced .
It &apos;s not balanced by any means , not even close .
And when we do have the occasional European success story , even those , then , typically end up being sold to the United States .
Like , Skype used to be secure .
It used to be end-to-end encrypted .
Then it was sold to the United States .
Today , it no longer is secure .
So once again , we take something which is secure and then we make it less secure on purpose , making all of us less secure as an outcome .
And then the argument that the United States is only fighting terrorists .
It &apos;s the war on terror .
You shouldn &apos;t worry about it .
Well , it &apos;s not the war on terror .
Yes , part of it is war on terror , and yes , there are terrorists , and they do kill and maim , and we should fight them , but we know through these leaks that they have used the same techniques to listen to phone calls of European leaders , to tap the email of residents of Mexico and Brazil , to read email traffic inside the United Nations Headquarters and E.U. Parliament , and I don &apos;t think they are trying to find terrorists from inside the E.U. Parliament , right ?
It &apos;s not the war on terror .
Part of it might be , and there are terrorists , but are we really thinking about terrorists as such an existential threat that we are willing to do anything at all to fight them ?
Are the Americans ready to throw away the Constituion and throw it in the trash just because there are terrorists ?
And the same thing with the Bill of Rights and all the amendments and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the E.U. conventions on human rights and fundamental freedoms and the press freedom ?
Do we really think terrorism is such an existential threat , we are ready to do anything at all ?
But people are scared about terrorists , and then they think that maybe that surveillance is okay because they have nothing to hide .
Feel free to survey me if that helps .
And whoever tells you that they have nothing to hide simply hasn &apos;t thought about this long enough .
Because we have this thing called privacy , and if you really think that you have nothing to hide , please make sure that &apos;s the first thing you tell me , because then I know that I should not trust you with any secrets , because obviously you can &apos;t keep a secret .
But people are brutally honest with the Internet , and when these leaks started , many people were asking me about this .
And I have nothing to hide .
I &apos;m not doing anything bad or anything illegal .
Yet , I have nothing that I would in particular like to share with an intelligence agency , especially a foreign intelligence agency .
And if we indeed need a Big Brother , I would much rather have a domestic Big Brother than a foreign Big Brother .
And when the leaks started , the very first thing I tweeted about this was a comment about how , when you &apos;ve been using search engines , you &apos;ve been potentially leaking all that to U.S. intelligence .
And two minutes later , I got a reply by somebody called Kimberly from the United States challenging me , like , why am I worried about this ?
What am I sending to worry about this ? Am I sending naked pictures or something ?
And my answer to Kimberly was that what I &apos;m sending is none of your business , and it should be none of your government &apos;s business either .
Because that &apos;s what it &apos;s about . It &apos;s about privacy .
Privacy is nonnegotiable .
It should be built in to all the systems we use .
And one thing we should all understand is that we are brutally honest with search engines .
You show me your search history , and I &apos;ll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes .
We are more honest with search engines than we are with our families .
Search engines know more about you than your family members know about you .
And this is all the kind of information we are giving away , we are giving away to the United States .
And surveillance changes history .
We know this through examples of corrupt presidents like Nixon .
Imagine if he would have had the kind of surveillance tools that are available today .
And let me actually quote the president of Brazil , Ms. Dilma Rousseff .
She was one of the targets of NSA surveillance .
Her email was read , and she spoke at the United Nations Headquarters , and she said , &quot; If there is no right to privacy , there can be no true freedom of expression and opinion , and therefore , there can be no effective democracy . &quot;
That &apos;s what it &apos;s about .
Privacy is the building block of our democracies .
And to quote a fellow security researcher , Marcus Ranum , he said that the United States is right now treating the Internet as it would be treating one of its colonies .
So we are back to the age of colonization , and we , the foreign users of the Internet , we should think about Americans as our masters .
So Mr. Snowden , he &apos;s been blamed for many things .
Some are blaming him for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry and software companies with these revelations -- and blaming Snowden for causing problems for the U.S. cloud industry would be the equivalent of blaming Al Gore for causing global warming .
So , what is there to be done ?
Should we worry . No , we shouldn &apos;t worry .
We should be angry , because this is wrong , and it &apos;s rude , and it should not be done .
But that &apos;s not going to really change the situation .
What &apos;s going to change the situation for the rest of the world is to try to steer away from systems built in the United States .
And that &apos;s much easier said than done .
How do you do that ?
A single country , any single country in Europe cannot replace and build replacements for the U.S.-made operating systems and cloud services .
But maybe you don &apos;t have to do it alone .
Maybe you can do it together with other countries .
The solution is open source .
By building together open , free , secure systems , we can go around such surveillance , and then one country doesn &apos;t have to solve the problem by itself .
It only has to solve one little problem .
And to quote a fellow security researcher , Haroon Meer , one country only has to make a small wave , but those small waves together become a tide , and the tide will lift all the boats up at the same time , and the tide we will build with secure , free , open-source systems , will become the tide that will lift all of us up and above the surveillance state .
Thank you very much .
Charlie Todd : The shared experience of absurdity
Charlie Todd causes bizarre , hilarious , and unexpected public scenes : Seventy synchronized dancers in storefront windows , &quot; ghostbusters &quot; running through the New York Public Library , and the annual no-pants subway ride . In his talk , he shows how his group , Improv Everywhere , uses these scenes to bring people together . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
I started Improv Everywhere about 10 years ago when I moved to New York City with an interest in acting and comedy .
Because I was new to the city , I didn &apos;t have access to a stage , so I decided to create my own in public places .
So the first project we &apos;re going to take a look at is the very first No Pants Subway Ride .
Now this took place in January of 2002 .
And this woman is the star of the video .
She doesn &apos;t know she &apos;s being filmed .
She &apos;s being filmed with a hidden camera .
This is on the 6 train in New York City .
And this is the first stop along the line .
These are two Danish guys who come out and sit down next to the hidden camera .
And that &apos;s me right there in a brown coat .
It &apos;s about 30 degrees outside .
I &apos;m wearing a hat . I &apos;m wearing a scarf .
And the girl &apos;s going to notice me right here .
And as you &apos;ll see now , I &apos;m not wearing pants .
So at this point -- at this point she &apos;s noticed me , but in New York there &apos;s weirdos on any given train car .
One person &apos;s not that unusual .
She goes back to reading her book , which is unfortunately titled &quot; Rape . &quot;
So she &apos;s noticed the unusual thing , but she &apos;s gone back to her normal life .
Now in the meantime , I have six friends who are waiting at the next six consecutive stops in their underwear as well .
They &apos;re going to be entering this car one by one .
We &apos;ll act as though we don &apos;t know each other .
And we &apos;ll act as if it &apos;s just an unfortunate mistake we &apos;ve made , forgetting our pants on this cold January day .
So at this point , she decides to put the rape book away .
And she decides to be a little bit more aware of her surroundings .
Now in the meantime , the two Danish guys to the left of the camera , they &apos;re cracking up .
They think this is the funniest thing they &apos;ve ever seen before .
And watch her make eye contact with them right about now .
And I love that moment in this video , because before it became a shared experience , it was something that was maybe a little bit scary , or something that was at least confusing to her .
And then once it became a shared experience , it was funny and something that she could laugh at .
So the train is now pulling into the third stop along the 6 line .
So the video won &apos;t show everything .
This goes on for another four stops .
A total of seven guys enter anonymously in their underwear .
At the eighth stop , a girl came in with a giant duffel bag and announced she had pants for sale for a dollar -- like you might sell batteries or candy on the train .
We all very matter of factly bought a pair of pants , put them on and said , &quot; Thank you . That &apos;s exactly what I needed today , &quot; and then exited without revealing what had happened and went in all different directions .
Thank you .
So that &apos;s a still from the video there .
And I love that girl &apos;s reaction so much .
And watching that videotape later that day inspired me to keep doing what I do .
And really one of the points of Improv Everywhere is to cause a scene in a public place that is a positive experience for other people .
It &apos;s a prank , but it &apos;s a prank that gives somebody a great story to tell .
And her reaction inspired me to do a second annual No Pants Subway Ride .
And we &apos;ve continued to do it every year .
This January , we did the 10th annual No Pants Subway Ride where a diverse group of 3,500 people rode the train in their underwear in New York -- almost every single train line in the city .
And also in 50 other cities around the world , people participated .
As I started taking improv class at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater and meeting other creative people and other performers and comedians , I started amassing a mailing list of people who wanted to do these types of projects .
So I could do more large-scale projects .
Well one day I was walking through Union Square , and I saw this building , which had just been built in 2005 .
And there was a girl in one of the windows and she was dancing .
And it was very peculiar , because it was dark out , but she was back-lit with florescent lighting , and she was very much onstage , and I couldn &apos;t figure out why she was doing it .
After about 15 seconds , her friend appeared -- she had been hiding behind a display -- and they laughed and hugged each other and ran away .
So it seemed like maybe she had been dared to do this .
So I got inspired by that .
Looking at the entire facade -- there were 70 total windows -- and I knew what I had to do .
So this project is called Look Up More . We had 70 actors dress in black .
This was completely unauthorized .
We didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
And I stood in the park giving signals .
The first signal was for everybody to hold up these four-foot tall letters that spelled out &quot; Look Up More , &quot; the name of the project .
The second signal was for everybody to do Jumping jacks together .
You &apos;ll see that start right here .
And then we had dancing . We had everyone dance .
And then we had dance solos where only one person would dance and everybody would point to them .
So then I gave a new hand signal , which signaled the next soloist down below in Forever 21 , and he danced .
There were several other activities .
We had people jumping up and down , people dropping to the ground .
And I was standing just anonymously in a sweatshirt , putting my hand on and off of a trashcan to signal the advancement .
And because it was in Union Square Park , right by a subway station , there were hundreds of people by the end who stopped and looked up and watched what we were doing .
There &apos;s a better photo of it .
So that particular event was inspired by a moment that I happened to stumble upon .
The next project I want to show was given to me in an email from a stranger .
A high school kid in Texas wrote me in 2006 and said , &quot; You should get as many people as possible to put on blue polo shirts and khaki pants and go into a Best Buy and stand around . &quot;
So I wrote this high school kid back immediately , and I said , &quot; Yes , you are correct .
I think I &apos;ll try to do that this weekend . Thank you . &quot;
So here &apos;s the video .
So again , this is 2005 .
This is the Best Buy in New York City .
We had about 80 people show up to participate , entering one-by-one .
There was an eight year-old girl , a 10 year-old girl .
There was also a 65 year-old man who participated .
So a very diverse group of people .
And I told people , &quot; Don &apos;t work . Don &apos;t actually do work .
But also , don &apos;t shop .
Just stand around and don &apos;t face products . &quot;
Now you can see the regular employees by the ones that have the yellow tags on their shirt .
Everybody else is one of our actors .
The lower level employees thought it was very funny .
And in fact , several of them went to go get their camera from the break room and took photos with us .
A lot of them made jokes about trying to get us to go to the back to get heavy television sets for customers .
The managers and the security guards , on the other hand , did not find it particularly funny .
You can see them in this footage .
They &apos;re wearing either a yellow shirt or a black shirt .
And we were there probably 10 minutes before the managers decided to dial 911 .
So they started running around telling everybody the cops were coming , watch out , the cops were coming .
And you can see the cops in this footage right here .
That &apos;s a cop wearing black right there , being filmed with a hidden camera .
Ultimately , the police had to inform Best Buy management that it was not , in fact , illegal to wear a blue polo shirt and khaki pants .
Thank you .
So we had been there for 20 minutes ; we were happy to exit the store .
One thing the managers were trying to do was to track down our cameras .
And they caught a couple of my guys who had hidden cameras in duffel bags .
But the one camera guy they never caught was the guy that went in just with a blank tape and went over to the Best Buy camera department and just put his tape in one of their cameras and pretended to shop .
So I like that concept of using their own technology against them .
I think our best projects are ones that are site specific and happen at a particular place for a reason .
And one morning , I was riding the subway .
I had to make a transfer at the 53rd St. stop where there are these two giant escalators .
And it &apos;s a very depressing place to be in the morning , it &apos;s very crowded .
So I decided to try and stage something that could make it as happy as possible for one morning .
So this was in the winter of 2009 -- 8 : 30 in the morning .
It &apos;s morning rush hour .
It &apos;s very cold outside .
People are coming in from Queens , transferring from the E train to the 6 train .
And they &apos;re going up these giant escalators on their way to their jobs .
Thank you .
So there &apos;s a photograph that illustrates it a little bit better .
He gave 2,000 high fives that day , and he washed his hands before and afterward and did not get sick .
And that was done also without permission , although no one seemed to care .
So I &apos;d say over the years , one of the most common criticisms I see of Improv Everywhere left anonymously on YouTube comments is : &quot; These people have too much time on their hands . &quot;
And you know , not everybody &apos;s going to like everything you do , and I &apos;ve certainly developed a thick skin thanks to Internet comments , but that one &apos;s always bothered me , because we don &apos;t have too much time on our hands .
The participants at Improv Everywhere events have just as much leisure time as any other New Yorkers , they just occasionally choose to spend it in an unusual way .
You know , every Saturday and Sunday , hundreds of thousands of people each fall gather in football stadiums to watch games .
And I &apos;ve never seen anybody comment , looking at a football game , saying , &quot; All those people in the stands , they have too much time on their hands . &quot;
And of course they don &apos;t .
It &apos;s a perfectly wonderful way to spent a weekend afternoon , watching a football game in a stadium .
But I think it &apos;s also a perfectly valid way to spend an afternoon freezing in place with 200 people in the Grand Central terminal or dressing up like a ghostbuster and running through the New York Public Library .
Or listening to the same MP3 as 3,000 other people and dancing silently in a park , or bursting into song in a grocery store as part of a spontaneous musical , or diving into the ocean in Coney Island wearing formal attire .
You know , as kids , we &apos;re taught to play .
And we &apos;re never given a reason why we should play .
It &apos;s just acceptable that play is a good thing .
And I think that &apos;s sort of the point of Improv Everywhere .
It &apos;s that there is no point and that there doesn &apos;t have to be a point .
We don &apos;t need a reason .
As long as it &apos;s fun and it seems like it &apos;s going to be a funny idea and it seems like the people who witness it will also have a fun time , then that &apos;s enough for us .
And I think , as adults , we need to learn that there &apos;s no right or wrong way to play .
Thank you very much .
Edi Rama : Take back your city with paint
Make a city beautiful , curb corruption . Edi Rama took this deceptively simple path as mayor of Tirana , Albania , where he instilled pride in his citizens by transforming public spaces with colorful designs . With projects that put the people first , Rama decreased crime -- and showed his citizens they could have faith in their leaders . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
In my previous life , I was an artist .
I still paint . I love art .
I love the joy that color can give to our lives and to our communities , and I try to bring something of the artist in me in my politics , and I see part of my job today , the reason for being here , not just to campaign for my party , but for politics , and the role it can play for the better in our lives .
For 11 years , I was mayor of Tirana , our capital .
We faced many challenges .
Art was part of the answer , and my name , in the very beginning , was linked with two things : demolition of illegal constructions in order to get public space back , and use of colors in order to revive the hope that had been lost in my city .
But this use of colors was not just an artistic act .
Rather , it was a form of political action in a context when the city budget I had available after being elected amounted to zero comma something .
When we painted the first building , by splashing a radiant orange on the somber gray of a facade , something unimaginable happened .
There was a traffic jam and a crowd of people gathered as if it were the location of some spectacular accident , or the sudden sighting of a visiting pop star .
The French E.U. official in charge of the funding rushed to block the painting .
He screeched that he would block the financing .
&quot; But why ? &quot; I asked him .
&quot; Because the colors you have ordered do not meet European standards , &quot; he replied .
&quot; Well , &quot; I told him , &quot; the surroundings do not meet European standards , even though this is not what we want , but we will choose the colors ourselves , because this is exactly what we want .
And if you do not let us continue with our work , I will hold a press conference here , right now , right in this road , and we will tell people that you look to me just like the censors of the socialist realism era . &quot;
Then he was kind of troubled , and asked me for a compromise .
But I told him no , I &apos;m sorry , compromise in colors is gray , and we have enough gray to last us a lifetime .
So it &apos;s time for change .
The rehabilitation of public spaces revived the feeling of belonging to a city that people lost .
The pride of people about their own place of living , and there were feelings that had been buried deep for years under the fury of the illegal , barbaric constructions that sprang up in the public space .
And when colors came out everywhere , a mood of change started transforming the spirit of people .
Big noise raised up : &quot; What is this ? What is happening ?
What are colors doing to us ? &quot;
And we made a poll , the most fascinating poll I &apos;ve seen in my life .
We asked people , &quot; Do you want this action , and to have buildings painted like that ? &quot;
And then the second question was , &quot; Do you want it to stop or do you want it to continue ? &quot;
To the first question , 63 percent of people said yes , we like it .
Thirty-seven said no , we don &apos;t like it .
But to the second question , half of them that didn &apos;t like it , they wanted it to continue .
So we noticed change .
People started to drop less litter in the streets , for example , started to pay taxes , started to feel something they had forgotten , and beauty was acting as a guardsman where municipal police , or the state itself , were missing .
One day I remember walking along a street that had just been colored , and where we were in the process of planting trees , when I saw a shopkeeper and his wife putting a glass facade to their shop .
They had thrown the old shutter in the garbage collection place .
&quot; Why did you throw away the shutters ? &quot; I asked him .
&quot; Well , because the street is safer now , &quot; they answered .
&quot; Safer ? Why ? They have posted more policemen here ? &quot;
&quot; Come on , man ! What policemen ?
You can see it for yourself . There are colors , streetlights , new pavement with no potholes , trees . So it &apos;s beautiful ; it &apos;s safe . &quot;
And indeed , it was beauty that was giving people this feeling of being protected .
And this was not a misplaced feeling .
Crime did fall .
The freedom that was won in 1990 brought about a state of anarchy in the city , while the barbarism of the &apos; 90s brought about a loss of hope for the city .
The paint on the walls did not feed children , nor did it tend the sick or educate the ignorant , but it gave hope and light , and helped to make people see there could be a different way of doing things , a different spirit , a different feel to our lives , and that if we brought the same energy and hope to our politics , we could build a better life for each other and for our country .
We removed 123,000 tons of concrete only from the riverbanks .
We demolished more than 5,000 illegal buildings all over the city , up to eight stories high , the tallest of them .
We planted 55,000 trees and bushes in the streets .
We established a green tax , and then everybody accepted it and all businessmen paid it regularly .
By means of open competitions , we managed to recruit in our administration many young people , and we thus managed to build a de-politicized public institution where men and women were equally represented .
International organizations have invested a lot in Albania during these 20 years , not all of it well spent .
When I told the World Bank directors that I wanted them to finance a project to build a model reception hall for citizens precisely in order to fight endemic daily corruption , they did not understand me .
But people were waiting in long queues under sun and under rain in order to get a certificate or just a simple answer from two tiny windows of two metal kiosks .
They were paying in order to skip the queue , the long queue .
The reply to their requests was met by a voice coming from this dark hole , and , on the other hand , a mysterious hand coming out to take their documents while searching through old documents for the bribe .
We could change the invisible clerks within the kiosks , every week , but we could not change this corrupt practice .
&quot; I &apos;m convinced , &quot; I told a German official with the World Bank , &quot; that it would be impossible for them to be bribed if they worked in Germany , in a German administration , just as I am convinced that if you put German officials from the German administration in those holes , they would be bribed just the same . &quot;
It &apos;s not about genes .
It &apos;s not about some being with a high conscience and some others having not a conscience .
It &apos;s about system , it &apos;s about organization .
It &apos;s also about environment and respect .
We removed the kiosks .
We built the bright new reception hall that made people , Tirana citizens , think they had traveled abroad when they entered to make their requests .
We created an online system of control and so speeded up all the processes .
We put the citizen first , and not the clerks .
The corruption in the state administration of countries like Albania -- it &apos;s not up to me to say also like Greece -- can be fought only by modernization .
Reinventing the government by reinventing politics itself is the answer , and not reinventing people based on a ready-made formula that the developed world often tries in vain to impose to people like us .
Things have come to this point because politicians in general , but especially in our countries , let &apos;s face it , think people are stupid .
They take it for granted that , come what may , people have to follow them , while politics , more and more , fails to offer answers for their public concerns or the exigencies of the common people .
Politics has come to resemble a cynical team game played by politicians , while the public has been pushed aside as if sitting on the seats of a stadium in which passion for politics is gradually making room for blindness and desperation .
Seen from those stairs , all politicians today seem the same , and politics has come to resemble a sport that inspires more aggressiveness and pessimism than social cohesion and the desire for civic protaganism .
Barack Obama won ‚Äî ‚Äî because he mobilized people as never before through the use of social networks .
He did not know each and every one of them , but with an admirable ingenuity , he managed to transform them into activists by giving them all the possibility to hold in their hands the arguments and the instruments that each would need to campaign in his name by making his own campaign .
I tweet . I love it .
I love it because it lets me get the message out , but it also lets people get their messages to me .
This is politics , not from top down , but from the bottom up , and sideways , and allowing everybody &apos;s voice to be heard is exactly what we need .
Politics is not just about leaders .
It &apos;s not just about politicians and laws .
It is about how people think , how they view the world around them , how they use their time and their energy .
When people say all politicians are the same , ask yourself if Obama was the same as Bush , if Fran√ßois Hollande is the same as Sarkozy .
They are not . They are human beings with different views and different visions for the world .
When people say nothing can change , just stop and think what the world was like 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 years ago .
Our world is defined by the pace of change .
We can all change the world .
I gave you a very small example of how one thing , the use of color , can make change happen .
I want to make more change as Prime Minister of my country , but every single one of you can make change happen if you want to .
President Roosevelt , he said , &quot; Believe you can , and you are halfway there . &quot;

Dan Meyer : Math class needs a makeover
Today &apos;s math curriculum is teaching students to expect -- and excel at -- paint-by-numbers classwork , robbing kids of a skill more important than solving problems : formulating them . In his talk , Dan Meyer shows classroom-tested math exercises that prompt students to stop and think . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Can I ask you to please recall a time when you really loved something -- a movie , an album , a song or a book -- and you recommended it wholeheartedly to someone you also really liked , and you anticipated that reaction , you waited for it , and it came back , and the person hated it ?
So , by way of introduction , that is the exact same state in which I spent every working day of the last six years .
I teach high school math .
I sell a product to a market that doesn &apos;t want it , but is forced by law to buy it .
I mean , it &apos;s just a losing proposition .
So there &apos;s a useful stereotype about students that I see , a useful stereotype about you all .
I could give you guys an algebra-two final exam , and I would expect no higher than a 25 percent pass rate .
And both of these facts say less about you or my students than they do about what we call math education in the U.S. today .
To start with , I &apos;d like to break math down into two categories .
One is computation ; this is the stuff you &apos;ve forgotten .
For example , factoring quadratics with leading coefficients greater than one .
This stuff is also really easy to relearn , provided you have a really strong grounding in reasoning . Math reasoning -- we &apos;ll call it the application of math processes to the world around us -- this is hard to teach .
This is what we would love students to retain , even if they don &apos;t go into mathematical fields .
This is also something that , the way we teach it in the U.S.
all but ensures they won &apos;t retain it .
So , I &apos;d like to talk about why that is , why that &apos;s such a calamity for society , what we can do about it and , to close with , why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher .
So first , five symptoms that you &apos;re doing math reasoning wrong in your classroom .
One is a lack of initiative ; your students don &apos;t self-start .
You finish your lecture block and immediately you have five hands going up asking you to re-explain the entire thing at their desks .
Students lack perseverance .
They lack retention ; you find yourself re-explaining concepts three months later , wholesale .
There &apos;s an aversion to word problems , which describes 99 percent of my students .
And then the other one percent is eagerly looking for the formula to apply in that situation .
This is really destructive .
David Milch , creator of &quot; Deadwood &quot; and other amazing TV shows , has a really good description for this .
He swore off creating contemporary drama , shows set in the present day , because he saw that when people fill their mind with four hours a day of , for example , &quot; Two and a Half Men , &quot; no disrespect , it shapes the neural pathways , he said , in such a way that they expect simple problems .
He called it , &quot; an impatience with irresolution . &quot;
You &apos;re impatient with things that don &apos;t resolve quickly .
You expect sitcom-sized problems that wrap up in 22 minutes , three commercial breaks and a laugh track .
And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
I am very concerned about this because I &apos;m going to retire in a world that my students will run .
I &apos;m doing bad things to my own future and well-being when I teach this way .
I &apos;m here to tell you that the way our textbooks -- particularly mass-adopted textbooks -- teach math reasoning and patient problem solving , it &apos;s functionally equivalent to turning on &quot; Two and a Half Men &quot; and calling it a day .
In all seriousness . Here &apos;s an example from a physics textbook .
It applies equally to math .
Notice , first of all here , that you have exactly three pieces of information there , each of which will figure into a formula somewhere , eventually , which the student will then compute .
I believe in real life .
And ask yourself , what problem have you solved , ever , that was worth solving where you knew all of the given information in advance ; where you didn &apos;t have a surplus of information and you had to filter it out , or you didn &apos;t have sufficient information and had to go find some .
I &apos;m sure we all agree that no problem worth solving is like that .
And the textbook , I think , knows how it &apos;s hamstringing students because , watch this , this is the practice problem set .
When it comes time to do the actual problem set , we have problems like this right here where we &apos;re just swapping out numbers and tweaking the context a little bit .
And if the student still doesn &apos;t recognize the stamp this was molded from , it helpfully explains to you what sample problem you can return to to find the formula .
You could literally , I mean this , pass this particular unit without knowing any physics , just knowing how to decode a textbook . That &apos;s a shame .
So I can diagnose the problem a little more specifically in math .
Here &apos;s a really cool problem . I like this .
It &apos;s about defining steepness and slope using a ski lift .
But what you have here is actually four separate layers , and I &apos;m curious which of you can see the four separate layers and , particularly , how when they &apos;re compressed together and presented to the student all at once , how that creates this impatient problem solving .
I &apos;ll define them here : You have the visual .
You also have the mathematical structure , talking about grids , measurements , labels , points , axes , that sort of thing .
You have substeps , which all lead to what we really want to talk about : which section is the steepest .
So I hope you can see .
I really hope you can see how what we &apos;re doing here is taking a compelling question , a compelling answer , but we &apos;re paving a smooth , straight path from one to the other and congratulating our students for how well they can step over the small cracks in the way .
That &apos;s all we &apos;re doing here .
So I want to put to you that if we can separate these in a different way and build them up with students , we can have everything we &apos;re looking for in terms of patient problem solving .
So right here I start with the visual , and I immediately ask the question : Which section is the steepest ?
And this starts conversation because the visual is created in such a way where you can defend two answers .
So you get people arguing against each other , friend versus friend , in pairs , journaling , whatever .
And then eventually we realize it &apos;s getting annoying to talk about the skier in the lower left-hand side of the screen or the skier just above the mid line .
And we realize how great would it be if we just had some A , B , C and D labels to talk about them more easily .
And then as we start to define what does steepness mean , we realize it would be nice to have some measurements to really narrow it down , specifically what that means .
And then and only then , we throw down that mathematical structure .
The math serves the conversation , the conversation doesn &apos;t serve the math .
And at that point , I &apos;ll put it to you that nine out of 10 classes are good to go on the whole slope , steepness thing .
But if you need to , your students can then develop those substeps together .
Do you guys see how this , right here , compared to that -- which one creates that patient problem solving , that math reasoning ?
It &apos;s been obvious in my practice , to me .
And I &apos;ll yield the floor here for a second to Einstein , who , I believe , has paid his dues .
He talked about the formulation of a problem being so incredibly important , and yet in my practice , in the U.S. here , we just give problems to students ; we don &apos;t involve them in the formulation of the problem .
So 90 percent of what I do with my five hours of prep time per week is to take fairly compelling elements of problems like this from my textbook and rebuild them in a way that supports math reasoning and patient problem solving .
And here &apos;s how it works .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
The question is : How long will it take you to fill it up ?
First things first , we eliminate all the substeps .
Students have to develop those , they have to formulate those .
And then notice that all the information written on there is stuff you &apos;ll need .
None of it &apos;s a distractor , so we lose that .
Students need to decide , &quot; All right , well , does the height matter ? Does the side of it matter ?
Does the color of the valve matter ? What matters here ? &quot;
Such an underrepresented question in math curriculum .
So now we have a water tank .
How long will it take you to fill it up ? And that &apos;s it .
And because this is the 21st century and we would love to talk about the real world on its own terms , not in terms of line art or clip art that you so often see in textbooks , we go out and we take a picture of it .
So now we have the real deal .
How long will it take it to fill it up ?
And then even better is we take a video , a video of someone filling it up .
And it &apos;s filling up slowly , agonizingly slowly .
It &apos;s tedious .
Students are looking at their watches , rolling their eyes , and they &apos;re all wondering at some point or another , &quot; Man , how long is it going to take to fill up ? &quot;
That &apos;s how you know you &apos;ve baited the hook , right ?
And that question , off this right here , is really fun for me because , like the intro , I teach kids -- because of my inexperience -- I teach the kids that are the most remedial , all right ?
And I &apos;ve got kids who will not join a conversation about math because someone else has the formula ; someone else knows how to work the formula better than me , so I won &apos;t talk about it .
But here , every student is on a level playing field of intuition .
Everyone &apos;s filled something up with water before , so I get kids answering the question , &quot; How long will it take ? &quot;
I &apos;ve got kids who are mathematically and conversationally intimidated joining the conversation .
We put names on the board , attach them to guesses , and kids have bought in here .
And then we follow the process I &apos;ve described .
And the best part here , or one of the better parts is that we don &apos;t get our answer from the answer key in the back of the teacher &apos;s edition .
We , instead , just watch the end of the movie .
And that &apos;s terrifying , because the theoretical models that always work out in the answer key in the back of a teacher &apos;s edition , that &apos;s great , but it &apos;s scary to talk about sources of error when the theoretical does not match up with the practical .
But those conversations have been so valuable , among the most valuable .
So I &apos;m here to report some really fun games with students who come pre-installed with these viruses day one of the class .
These are the kids who now , one semester in , I can put something on the board , totally new , totally foreign , and they &apos;ll have a conversation about it for three or four minutes more than they would have at the start of the year , which is just so fun .
We &apos;re no longer averse to word problems , because we &apos;ve redefined what a word problem is .
We &apos;re no longer intimidated by math , because we &apos;re slowly redefining what math is .
This has been a lot of fun .
I encourage math teachers I talk to to use multimedia , because it brings the real world into your classroom in high resolution and full color ; to encourage student intuition for that level playing field ; to ask the shortest question you possibly can and let those more specific questions come out in conversation ; to let students build the problem , because Einstein said so ; and to finally , in total , just be less helpful , because the textbook is helping you in all the wrong ways : It &apos;s buying you out of your obligation , for patient problem solving and math reasoning , to be less helpful .
And why this is an amazing time to be a math teacher right now is because we have the tools to create this high-quality curriculum in our front pocket .
It &apos;s ubiquitous and fairly cheap , and the tools to distribute it freely under open licenses has also never been cheaper or more ubiquitous .
I put a video series on my blog not so long ago and it got 6,000 views in two weeks .
I get emails still from teachers in countries I &apos;ve never visited saying , &quot; Wow , yeah . We had a good conversation about that .
Oh , and by the way , here &apos;s how I made your stuff better , &quot; which , wow .
I put this problem on my blog recently : In a grocery store , which line do you get into , the one that has one cart and 19 items or the line with four carts and three , five , two and one items .
And the linear modeling involved in that was some good stuff for my classroom , but it eventually got me on &quot; Good Morning America &quot; a few weeks later , which is just bizarre , right ?
And from all of this , I can only conclude that people , not just students , are really hungry for this .
Math makes sense of the world .
Math is the vocabulary for your own intuition .
So I just really encourage you , whatever your stake is in education -- whether you &apos;re a student , parent , teacher , policy maker , whatever -- insist on better math curriculum .
We need more patient problem solvers . Thank you .

The wonderful Nellie McKay sings &quot; Mother of Pearl &quot; and &quot; If I Had You &quot; from her sparkling set at TED2008 .
Feminists don &apos;t have a sense of humor . Feminists just want to be alone -- boo hoo , hoo , hoo . Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors . They have a tumor on their funny bone . They say child molestation isn &apos;t funny -- ha , ha , ha , ha . Rape and degradation &apos;s just a crime -- lighten up , ladies . Rampant prostitution &apos;s sex for money -- what &apos;s wrong with that ? Can &apos;t these chicks do anything but whine ? Dance break ! Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da . Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da . Woo-hoo ! Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da -- yeah , take it off . Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , dum . They say cheap objectification isn &apos;t witty -- it &apos;s hot ! Equal work and wages worth the fight -- sing us a new one . On-demand abortion every city -- OK , but no gun control . Won &apos;t these women ever get a life ? Feminists don &apos;t have a sense of humor -- poor Hillary . Feminists and vegetarians -- make mine a Big Mac . Feminists spread vicious lies and rumors . They &apos;re far too sensitive to ever be a ham , that &apos;s why these feminists just need to find a man . Da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da , da . I &apos;m Dennis Kucinich and I approved this message .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
I asked my mother , you know , should I say anything in support of anyone ?
And she said , &quot; Oh no ! Just dis everybody , except Ralph Nader . &quot;
I could show the world how to smile , I could be glad all of the while . I could turn the gray skies to blue , if I had you . I could leave the old days behind , leave all my pals , I &apos;d never mind . I could start my life all anew , if I had you . I could climb the snow-capped mountains , sail the mighty ocean wide . I could cross the burning desert , if I had you by my side . I could be a king , dear , uncrowned , humble or poor , rich or renowned . There is nothing I couldn &apos;t do , if I had you . Thank you . Well , thank you so much .
Mariana Mazzucato : Government -- investor , risk-taker , innovator
Why doesn &apos;t the government just get out of the way and let the private sector -- the &quot; real revolutionaries &quot; -- innovate ? It &apos;s rhetoric you hear everywhere , and Mariana Mazzucato wants to dispel it . In an energetic talk , she shows how the state -- which many see as a slow , hunkering behemoth -- is really one of our most exciting risk-takers and market-shapers .
Have you ever asked yourselves why it is that companies , the really cool companies , the innovative ones , the creative , new economy-type companies -- Apple , Google , Facebook -- are coming out of one particular country , the United States of America ?
Usually when I say this , someone says , &quot; Spotify !
That &apos;s Europe . &quot; But , yeah .
It has not had the impact that these other companies have had .
Now what I do is I &apos;m an economist , and I actually study the relationship between innovation and economic growth at the level of the company , the industry and the nation , and I work with policymakers worldwide , especially in the European Commission , but recently also in interesting places like China , and I can tell you that that question is on the tip of all of their tongues : Where are the European Googles ?
What is the secret behind the Silicon Valley growth model , which they understand is different from this old economy growth model ?
And what is interesting is that often , even if we &apos;re in the 21st century , we kind of come down in the end to these ideas of market versus state .
It &apos;s talked about in these modern ways , but the idea is that somehow , behind places like Silicon Valley , the secret have been different types of market-making mechanisms , the private initiative , whether this be about a dynamic venture capital sector that &apos;s actually able to provide that high-risk finance to these innovative companies , the gazelles as we often call them , which traditional banks are scared of , or different types of really successful commercialization policies which actually allow these companies to bring these great inventions , their products , to the market and actually get over this really scary Death Valley period in which many companies instead fail .
But what really interests me , especially nowadays and because of what &apos;s happening politically around the world , is the language that &apos;s used , the narrative , the discourse , the images , the actual words .
So we often are presented with the kind of words like that the private sector is also much more innovative because it &apos;s able to think out of the box .
They are more dynamic .
Think of Steve Jobs &apos; really inspirational speech to the 2005 graduating class at Stanford , where he said to be innovative , you &apos;ve got to stay hungry , stay foolish .
Right ? So these guys are kind of the hungry and foolish and colorful guys , right ?
And in places like Europe , it might be more equitable , we might even be a bit better dressed and eat better than the U.S. , but the problem is this damn public sector .
It &apos;s a bit too big , and it hasn &apos;t actually allowed these things like dynamic venture capital and commercialization to actually be able to really be as fruitful as it could .
And even really respectable newspapers , some that I &apos;m actually subscribed to , the words they use are , you know , the state as this Leviathan . Right ?
This monster with big tentacles .
They &apos;re very explicit in these editorials .
They say , &quot; You know , the state , it &apos;s necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution , but you know what , what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet ?
We all hope it might be something green , or all of this nanotech stuff , and in order for that stuff to happen , &quot; they say -- this was a special issue on the next industrial revolution -- they say , &quot; the state , just stick to the basics , right ?
Fund the infrastructure . Fund the schools .
Even fund the basic research , because this is popularly recognized , in fact , as a big public good which private companies don &apos;t want to invest in , do that , but you know what ?
Leave the rest to the revolutionaries . &quot;
Those colorful , out-of-the-box kind of thinkers .
They &apos;re often called garage tinkerers , because some of them actually did some things in garages , even though that &apos;s partly a myth .
And so what I want to do with you in , oh God , only 10 minutes , is to really think again this juxtaposition , because it actually has massive , massive implications beyond innovation policy , which just happens to be the area that I often talk with with policymakers .
It has huge implications , even with this whole notion that we have on where , when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which , of course , as we know , are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition .
Right ? I mean , the reason that we need to maybe have free schools or charter schools is in order to make them more innovative without being emburdened by this heavy hand of the state curriculum , or something .
So these kind of words are constantly , these juxtapositions come up everywhere , not just with innovation policy .
And so to think again , there &apos;s no reason that you should believe me , so just think of some of the smartest revolutionary things that you have in your pockets and do not turn it on , but you might want to take it out , your iPhone .
Ask who actually funded the really cool , revolutionary thinking-out-of-the-box things in the iPhone .
What actually makes your phone a smartphone , basically , instead of a stupid phone ?
So the Internet , which you can surf the web anywhere you are in the world ; GPS , where you can actually know where you are anywhere in the world ; the touchscreen display , which makes it also a really easy-to-use phone for anybody .
These are the very smart , revolutionary bits about the iPhone , and they &apos;re all government-funded .
And the point is that the Internet was funded by DARPA , U.S. Department of Defense .
GPS was funded by the military &apos;s Navstar program .
Even Siri was actually funded by DARPA .
The touchscreen display was funded by two public grants by the CIA and the NSF to two public university researchers at the University of Delaware .
Now , you might be thinking , &quot; Well , she &apos;s just said the word &apos; defense &apos; and &apos; military &apos; an awful lot , &quot; but what &apos;s really interesting is that this is actually true in sector after sector and department after department .
So the pharmaceutical industry , which I am personally very interested in because I &apos;ve actually had the fortune to study it in quite some depth , is wonderful to be asking this question about the revolutionary versus non-revolutionary bits , because each and every medicine can actually be divided up on whether it really is revolutionary or incremental .
So the new molecular entities with priority rating are the revolutionary new drugs , whereas the slight variations of existing drugs -- Viagra , different color , different dosage -- are the less revolutionary ones .
And it turns out that a full 75 percent of the new molecular entities with priority rating are actually funded in boring , Kafkian public sector labs .
This doesn &apos;t mean that Big Pharma is not spending on innovation .
They do . They spend on the marketing part .
They spend on the D part of R &amp; amp ; D.
They spend an awful lot on buying back their stock , which is quite problematic .
In fact , companies like Pfizer and Amgen recently have spent more money in buying back their shares to boost their stock price than on R &amp; amp ; D , but that &apos;s a whole different TED Talk which one day I &apos;d be fascinated to tell you about .
Now , what &apos;s interesting in all of this is the state , in all these examples , was doing so much more than just fixing market failures .
It was actually shaping and creating markets .
It was funding not only the basic research , which again is a typical public good , but even the applied research .
It was even , God forbid , being a venture capitalist .
So these SBIR and SDTR programs , which give small companies early-stage finance have not only been extremely important compared to private venture capital , but also have become increasingly important .
Why ? Because , as many of us know , V.C. is actually quite short-term .
They want their returns in three to five years .
Innovation takes a much longer time than that , 15 to 20 years .
And so this whole notion -- I mean , this is the point , right ?
Who &apos;s actually funding the hard stuff ?
Of course , it &apos;s not just the state .
The private sector does a lot .
But the narrative that we &apos;ve always been told is the state is important for the basics , but not really providing that sort of high-risk , revolutionary thinking out of the box .
In all these sectors , from funding the Internet to doing the spending , but also the envisioning , the strategic vision , for these investments , it was actually coming within the state .
The nanotechnology sector is actually fascinating to study this , because the word itself , nanotechnology , came from within government .
And so there &apos;s huge implications of this .
First of all , of course I &apos;m not someone , this old-fashioned person , market versus state .
What we all know in dynamic capitalism is that what we actually need are public-private partnerships .
But the point is , by constantly depicting the state part as necessary but actually -- pffff -- a bit boring and often a bit dangerous kind of Leviathan , I think we &apos;ve actually really stunted the possibility to build these public-private partnerships in a really dynamic way .
Even the words that we often use to justify the &quot; P &quot; part , the public part -- well , they &apos;re both P &apos;s -- with public-private partnerships is in terms of de-risking .
What the public sector did in all these examples I just gave you , and there &apos;s many more , which myself and other colleagues have been looking at , is doing much more than de-risking .
It &apos;s kind of been taking on that risk . Bring it on .
It &apos;s actually been the one thinking out of the box .
But also , I &apos;m sure you all have had experience with local , regional , national governments , and you &apos;re kind of like , &quot; You know what , that Kafkian bureaucrat , I &apos;ve met him . &quot;
That whole juxtaposition thing , it &apos;s kind of there .
Well , there &apos;s a self-fulfilling prophecy .
By talking about the state as kind of irrelevant , boring , it &apos;s sometimes that we actually create those organizations in that way .
So what we have to actually do is build these entrepreneurial state organizations .
DARPA , that funded the Internet and Siri , actually thought really hard about this , how to welcome failure , because you will fail .
You will fail when you innovative .
One out of 10 experiments has any success .
And the V.C. guys know this , and they &apos;re able to actually fund the other losses from that one success .
And this brings me , actually , probably , to the biggest implication , and this has huge implications beyond innovation .
If the state is more than just a market fixer , if it actually is a market shaper , and in doing that has had to take on this massive risk , what happened to the reward ?
We all know , if you &apos;ve ever taken a finance course , the first thing you &apos;re taught is sort of the risk-reward relationship , and so some people are foolish enough or probably smart enough if they have time to wait , to actually invest in stocks , because they &apos;re higher risk which over time will make a greater reward than bonds , that whole risk-reward thing .
Well , where &apos;s the reward for the state of having taken on these massive risks and actually been foolish enough to have done the Internet ?
The Internet was crazy .
It really was . I mean , the probability of failure was massive .
You had to be completely nuts to do it , and luckily , they were .
Now , we don &apos;t even get to this question about rewards unless you actually depict the state as this risk-taker .
And the problem is that economists often think , well , there is a reward back to the state . It &apos;s tax .
You know , the companies will pay tax , the jobs they create will create growth so people who get those jobs and their incomes rise will come back to the state through the tax mechanism .
Well , unfortunately , that &apos;s not true .
Okay , it &apos;s not true because many of the jobs that are created go abroad .
Globalization , and that &apos;s fine . We shouldn &apos;t be nationalistic .
Let the jobs go where they have to go , perhaps .
I mean , one can take a position on that .
But also these companies that have actually had this massive benefit from the state -- Apple &apos;s a great example .
They even got the first -- well , not the first , but 500,000 dollars actually went to Apple , the company , through this SBIC program , which predated the SBIR program , as well as , as I said before , all the technologies behind the iPhone .
And yet we know they legally , as many other companies , pay very little tax back .
So what we really need to actually rethink is should there perhaps be a return-generating mechanism that &apos;s much more direct than tax . Why not ?
It could happen perhaps through equity .
This , by the way , in the countries that are actually thinking about this strategically , countries like Finland in Scandinavia , but also in China and Brazil , they &apos;re retaining equity in these investments .
Sitra funded Nokia , kept equity , made a lot of money , it &apos;s a public funding agency in Finland , which then funded the next round of Nokias .
The Brazilian Development Bank , which is providing huge amounts of funds today to clean technology , they just announced a 56 billion program for the future on this , is retaining equity in these investments .
So to put it provocatively , had the U.S. government thought about this , and maybe just brought back just something called an innovation fund , you can bet that , you know , if even just .05 percent of the profits from what the Internet produced had come back to that innovation fund , there would be so much more money to spend today on green technology .
Instead , many of the state budgets which in theory are trying to do that are being constrained .
But perhaps even more important , we heard before about the one percent , the 99 percent .
If the state is thought about in this more strategic way , as one of the lead players in the value creation mechanism , because that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about , right ?
Who are the different players in creating value in the economy , and is the state &apos;s role , has it been sort of dismissed as being a backseat player ?
If we can actually have a broader theory of value creation and allow us to actually admit what the state has been doing and reap something back , it might just be that in the next round , and I hope that we all hope that the next big revolution will in fact be green , that that period of growth will not only be smart , innovation-led , not only green , but also more inclusive , so that the public schools in places like Silicon Valley can actually also benefit from that growth , because they have not .
Thank you .
Jennifer 8 . Lee : The hunt for General Tso
Reporter Jennifer 8 . Lee talks about her hunt for the origins of familiar Chinese-American dishes -- exploring the hidden spots where these two cultures have combined to form a new cuisine .
There are more Chinese restaurants in this country than McDonald &apos;s , Burger King , Kentucky Fried Chicken and Wendy &apos;s , combined -- 40,000 , actually .
Chinese restaurants have played an important role in American history , as a matter of fact .
The Cuban missile crisis was resolved in a Chinese restaurant called Yenching Palace in Washington , D.C. , which unfortunately is closed now , and about to be turned into Walgreen &apos;s .
And the house that John Wilkes Booth planned the assassination of Abraham Lincoln is actually also now a Chinese restaurant called Wok &apos; n Roll , on H Street in Washington .
And it &apos;s not completely gratuitous , because wok and roll -- Chinese food and Japanese foods , so it kind of works out .
And Americans love their Chinese food so much they &apos;ve actually brought it into space .
NASA , for example , serves thermal-stabilized sweet-and-sour pork on its shuttle menu for its astronauts .
So , let me present the question to you : If our benchmark for Americanness is apple pie , you should ask yourself , how often do you eat apple pie , versus how often do you eat Chinese food . Right ?
And if you think about it , a lot of the foods that you think of or we think of or Americans think of as Chinese food are barely recognizable to Chinese , for example : beef with broccoli , egg rolls , General Tso &apos;s Chicken , fortune cookies , chop suey , the take-out boxes .
For example , I took a whole bunch of fortune cookies back to China , gave them to Chinese to see how they would react .
What is this ?
Should I try it ?
Try it !
What is it called ?
Fortune cookie .
There &apos;s a piece of paper inside !
What is this ?
You &apos;ve won a prize !
What is this ?
It &apos;s a fortune !
Tasty !
So , where are they from ?
The short answer is , actually , they &apos;re from Japan .
And in Kyoto , outside , there are still small family-run bakeries that make fortune cookies , as they did over 100 years ago , 30 years before fortune cookies were introduced in the United States .
If you see them side by side , there &apos;s yellow and brown .
Theirs are actually flavored with miso and sesame paste , so they &apos;re not as sweet as our version .
So , how did they get to the United States ?
Well , the short answer is , the Japanese immigrants came over , and a bunch of the bakers introduced them -- including at least one in Los Angeles , and one here in San Francisco called Benkyo-do , which is on the corner of Sutter and Buchanan .
They back then , actually , made fortune cookies using very much the similar kind of irons that we saw back in Kyoto .
So , the interesting question is , how do you go from fortune cookies being something that is Japanese to being something that is Chinese ?
Well , the short answer is , we locked up all the Japanese during World War II , including those that made fortune cookies , so that &apos;s the time when the Chinese moved in , kind of saw a market opportunity and took over .
So , fortune cookies : invented by the Japanese , popularized by the Chinese , but ultimately consumed by Americans .
They are more American than anything else .
Another one of my favorite dishes : General Tso &apos;s Chicken -- which , by the way , in the US Naval Academy is called Admiral Tso &apos;s Chicken .
I love this dish .
The original name in my book was actually called The Long March of General Tso , and he has marched very far indeed , because he is sweet , he is fried , and he is chicken -- all things that Americans love .
He has marched so far , actually , that the chef who originally invented the dish doesn &apos;t recognize it ; he &apos;s kind of horrified .
He &apos;s in Taiwan right now .
He &apos;s retired , deaf and plays a lot of Mahjong .
So , he -- after this I showed him , he got up , and he &apos;s like , &quot; Mominqimiao , &quot; which means , &quot; This is all nonsense , &quot; and goes back to play his Mahjong game during the afternoon .
So , another dish . One of my favorites . Beef with broccoli .
Broccoli is not a Chinese vegetable ; in fact , it is originally an Italian vegetable .
It was introduced into the United States in the 1800s , but became popularized in the 1920s and the 1930s .
In fact , the Chinese had their own version of broccoli , which is called Chinese broccoli , but right now , what -- they &apos;ve now discovered American broccoli , and are importing it as a , sort of , exotic delicacy .
I guarantee you , General Tso never saw a stalk of broccoli in his life -- and indeed , that actually was a picture of General Tso .
I went to his home town .
This is a billboard that says : &quot; Welcome to the birthplace of General Tso . &quot;
And I went looking for chicken .
Finally found a cow -- and did find chicken .
Believe it or not , these guys were actually crossing the road .
And -- -- I actually found a whole bunch of General Tso &apos;s relatives who are still in the little town .
This guy is now five generations removed from the General ; this guy is about seven .
Showed them all the pictures of General Tso Chicken that I showed you , and they &apos;re like , we don &apos;t know this dish .
And then they &apos;re like , is this Chinese food ?
Because it doesn &apos;t look like Chinese food to them .
But they weren &apos;t kind of surprised I traveled around the world to visit them , because in their eyes he is , after all , a famous Qing dynasty military hero .
He played an important role in the Taiping rebellion , which was a war started by a guy who thought he was the son of God and the baby brother of Jesus Christ .
And caused the war that killed 20 million people -- still the deadliest civil war in the world to this day .
So , you know , I realized when I was there , General Tso is kind of a lot like Colonel Sanders in America , in that he &apos;s known for chicken and not war .
But in China , this guy &apos;s actually known for war and not chicken .
But the granddaddy of all the Chinese-American dishes we probably ought to talk about is chop suey , which was introduced around the turn of the 20th century .
And according to New York Times , in 1904 , there was an outbreak of Chinese restaurants all over town , and &quot; the city has gone &apos; chop suey &apos; mad . &quot;
So it took about 30 years before the Americans realized that , whoa , chop suey is actually not known in China .
And as this article points out , &quot; The average native of any city in China knows nothing of chop suey . &quot;
You know , back then it was a way to show that you were sophisticated and cosmopolitan : if you were a guy and you wanted to impress a girl , you could take her out on a chop suey date .
I like to say chop suey &apos;s the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another , because chop suey , if you translate into Chinese , means tsap sui , which , if you translate back , means &quot; odds and ends . &quot;
So , these people are going around China asking for chop suey , which is sort of like a Japanese guy coming here and saying , I understand you have a very popular dish in your country called &quot; leftovers , &quot; and it is particularly -- -- right ?
And not only that : this dish is particularly popular after that holiday you call Thanksgiving .
So , why -- why and where -- did chop suey come from ?
Let &apos;s go back to mid-1800s when the Chinese first came to America .
Now back then , the Americans were not clamoring to eat Chinese food .
In fact , they saw this people who landed at their shores as alien .
These people weren &apos;t eating dogs -- they were eating cats -- and they weren &apos;t eating cats -- they were eating rats .
In fact , The New York Times , my esteemed employer , in 1883 ran an article that asked , &quot; Do Chinese eat rats ? &quot;
And not the most PC question to be asked today , but if you kind of look at the popular imagery of the time , not so outlandish .
This is actually a real advertisement for rat poison from the late 1800s , and if you see , under the word &quot; Clears &quot; -- very small -- it says , &quot; They must go , &quot; which refers not only to the rats , but to the Chinese in their midst , because the way that the food was perceived was that these people who ate foods different from us must be different from us .
And another way that you saw , sort of , this sort of , this antipathy towards the Chinese is through documents like this .
This is actually in the Library of Congress ; it is a pamphlet published by Samuel Gompers , hero of our American labor movement , and it &apos;s called , &quot; Some Reason for Chinese Exclusion : Meat versus Rice : American Manhood against Asiatic Coolieism : Which shall survive ?
And it basically made the argument that Chinese men who ate rice would necessarily bring down the standard of living for American men who ate meat .
And as a matter of fact , then , this is one of the reasons why we must exclude them from this country So , with sentiments like these , the Chinese Exclusion Act was sort of passed between 1882 and 1902 , the only time in American history when a group was specifically excluded for its national origin or ethnicity .
So , in a way , because the Chinese were attacked , chop suey was created as a defense mechanism .
Now , who came up with the idea of chop suey ?
There &apos;s a lot of different mysteries , a lot of different legends , but of the ones that I &apos;ve found that I thought was most interesting is this article from 1904 .
A Chinese guy named Lem Sen shows up in Chinatown , New York City , and says , I want you guys all to stop making chop suey , because I am the original creator and sole proprietor of the dish known as chop suey .
And the way that he tells it , there was a guy , there was a famous Chinese diplomat that showed up , and he was told to make a dish that looked very popular and could , quote , &quot; pass &quot; as Chinese .
And as he said -- we would never print this today -- but basically , the American man has become very rich .
Lem Sen , who &apos;s this guy : I would have made this money , too , but I &apos;ve spent all this time looking for the American man who stole my recipe .
Now I &apos;ve come and found him , and I want my recipe back and I want everyone to stop making chop suey , or pay me for the right to do the same .
So it was an early exercise of intellectual property rights .
So the thing is , this kind of idea of Chinese-American food doesn &apos;t exist only in America .
In fact , if you think about it , Chinese food is the most pervasive food on the planet , served on all seven continents , even Antarctica , because Monday night is Chinese food night at McMurdo Station , which is the main scientific station in Antarctica .
So , you see different varieties of Chinese food .
For example , there is French Chinese food , where they serve salt and pepper frog legs .
There is Italian Chinese food , where they don &apos;t have fortune cookies , so they serve fried gelato .
My downstairs neighbor , Alessandra , was completely shocked when I told her , &quot; Dude , fried gelato is not Chinese . &quot;
She &apos;s like , &quot; It &apos;s not ?
But they serve it in all the Chinese restaurants in Italy . &quot;
And even the Brits have their own version .
This is a dish called crispy shredded beef , which has a lot of crisp , a lot of shred , and not a lot of beef .
There is West Indian Chinese food , there &apos;s Jamaican Chinese food , there is Middle Eastern Chinese food , there &apos;s Mauritian Chinese food .
This is a dish called Magic Bowl that I discovered .
There &apos;s Indian Chinese food , Korean Chinese food , Japanese Chinese food , where they take the bao , the little buns , and they make them into pizza versions , and they take -- and they -- like , totally randomly they &apos;ll take Chinese noodle dishes , and they &apos;ll just Ramen-ize them .
This is , like , this is something that in the Chinese version has no soup .
So , there &apos;s Peruvian Chinese food , which should not be mixed with Mexican Chinese food , where they basically take things and make it look like fajitas .
And then -- one thing : they have things like risotto chop suey .
My personal favorite of all the restaurants I &apos;ve encountered around the world was this one in Brazil , called &quot; Kung Food . &quot;
So , let &apos;s take a step back , and kind of , understand what is to be appreciated in America .
McDonald &apos;s has , sort of , garnered a lot of attention , a lot of respect , for basically standardizing the menu , d√©cor and dining experience in post-World War II America .
But you know what ?
They actually did so through a centralized headquarters out of Illinois , right ?
Chinese restaurants have done largely the same thing , I would argue , with the menu and the d√©cor -- even the restaurant name -- but without a centralized headquarters .
So , this actually became very clear to me with the March 30 , 2005 Powerball drawing , where , you know , they expected , based on the number of ticket sales they had , to have three or four second-place winners -- those are the people who match five or six Powerball numbers .
Instead , they had 110 , and they were completely shocked .
They looked all across the country , and discovered it couldn &apos;t necessarily be fraud , because it happened , you know , in different states , across different computer systems .
So whatever it was , it caused people to sort of behave in a mass synchronized way .
So , like , OK , maybe it had to do with the patterns on the little pieces of paper -- you know , like , it was a diamond , or , you know , diagonal .
It wasn &apos;t that .
It wasn &apos;t that , so they &apos;re like , OK , let &apos;s look at television , so they looked at an episode of &quot; Lost . &quot;
Now , I don &apos;t have a TV , which makes me a freak , but very productive , and -- -- and this episode of &quot; Lost , &quot; I understand , where the overweight guy has a lucky number which was not a lucky number , which was how long they &apos;d been on the island , but they looked , and the numbers did not match .
So they looked at &quot; The Young and The Restless , &quot; and it wasn &apos;t that , either .
So , it wasn &apos;t until the first guy shows up the next day , and they ask him , &quot; Where did you get your number from ? &quot;
He &apos;s like , &quot; Oh , I got it from a fortune cookie . &quot;
This actually is a slip that one of the winners had , because the Tennessee lottery security officials were like , oh , no -- like , this can &apos;t be true .
But it was true , and basically , of those 110 people , and 104 of them or so had gotten their number from the fortune cookie .
Yeah . So , I went and started looking .
I went across the country , looking for these restaurants where these people had gotten their fortune cookies from .
You know , there are a bunch of them , including Lee &apos;s China in Omaha -- which is actually run by Koreans , but that &apos;s another point -- and a bunch of them named China Buffet .
So , what &apos;s interesting is that their stories were similar , but they were different .
It was lunch , it was take-out , it was sit-down , it was buffet , it was three weeks ago , it was three months ago .
But at some point , all these people had a very similar experience that converged at a fortune cookie and at a Chinese restaurant , and all these Chinese restaurants were serving fortune cookies , which , of course we know aren &apos;t even Chinese to begin with .
So it &apos;s kind of part of the phenomenon I called spontaneous self-organization , right , where , like in ant colonies , where little decisions made by -- on the micro-level actually have a big impact on the macro-level .
So , a good sort of contrast is Chicken McNuggets .
McDonald &apos;s actually spent 10 years coming out with a chicken-like product .
They did chicken pot pie , they did fried chicken , and then they finally introduced Chicken McNuggets .
And the great innovation of Chicken McNuggets was not nuggetfying them , because that &apos;s kind of an easy concept , but the trick behind Chicken McNuggets was , they were able to remove the chicken from the bone in a cost-effective manner , which is why it took so long for other people to copy them .
It took 10 years , and then within a couple of months , it was such a hit they just introduced it and rolled it across the entire system of McDonald &apos;s in the country .
In contrast , we have General Tso &apos;s Chicken , which actually started in New York City in the early 1970s , as I was also starting in the university in New York City in the early 1970s , so ...
And this logo !
So me , General Tso &apos;s Chicken and this logo are all karmacally related .
But that dish also took about 10 years to spread across America from a random restaurant in New York City .
Someone &apos;s like , oh , God -- it &apos;s sweet , it &apos;s fried , it &apos;s chicken : Americans will love this .
So , what I like to say , you know , this being sort of Bay Area , Silicon Valley -- is that we think of McDonald &apos;s as sort of the Microsoft of the dining experiences .
We can think of Chinese restaurants perhaps as Linux : sort of an open source thing , right , where ideas from one person can be copied and propagated across the entire system , that there can be specialized versions of Chinese food , you know , depending on the region .
For example , you know , in New Orleans we have Cajun Chinese food , where they serve Sichuan alligator and sweet and sour crawfish , right ?
And in Philadelphia , you have Philadelphia cheesesteak roll , which looks like an egg roll on the outside , but a cheesesteak on the inside .
I was really surprised to discover that , not only in Philadelphia , but also in Atlanta , because what had happened was that a Chinese family had moved from Atlanta to -- sorry , from Philadelphia to Atlanta , and brought that with them .
So , the thing is , our historical lore , because of the way we like narratives , are full of vast characters such as , you know , Howard Schultz of Starbucks and Ray Kroc with McDonald &apos;s and Asa Chandler with Coca-Cola .
But , you know , it &apos;s very easy to overlook the smaller characters -- oops -- for example , like Lem Sen , who introduced chop suey , Chef Peng , who introduced General Tso Chicken , and all the Japanese bakers who introduced fortune cookies .
So , the point of my presentation is to make you think twice , that those whose names are forgotten in history can often have had as much , if not more , impact on what we eat today .
So . Thank you very much .
Dong Woo Jang : The art of bow-making
Dong Woo Jang has an unusual after school hobby . Jang , who was 15 when he gave the talk , tells the story of how living in the concrete jungle of Seoul inspired him to build the perfect bow . Watch him demo one of his beautiful hand-crafted archer &apos;s bows .
It is said that the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence , and I believe this is true , especially when I hear President Obama often talk about the Korean education system as a benchmark of success .
Well , I can tell you that , in the rigid structure and highly competitive nature of the Korean school system , also known as pressure cooker , not everyone can do well in that environment .
While many people responded in different ways about our education system , my response to the high-pressure environment was making bows with pieces of wood found near my apartment building .
Why bows ?
I &apos;m not quite sure .
Perhaps , in the face of constant pressure , my caveman instinct of survival has connected with the bows .
If you think about it , the bow has really helped drive human survival since prehistoric times .
The area within three kilometers of my home used to be a mulberry forest during the Joseon dynasty , where silkworms were fed with mulberry leaves .
In order to raise the historical awareness of this fact , the government has planted mulberry trees .
The seeds from these trees also have spread by birds here and there nearby the soundproof walls of the city expressway that has been built around the 1988 Olympics .
The area near these walls , which nobody bothers to pay attention to , had been left free from major intervention , and this is where I first found my treasures .
As I fell deeper into bow making , I began to search far and beyond my neighborhood .
When I went on school field trips , family vacations , or simply on my way home from extracurricular classes , I wandered around wooded areas and gathered tree branches with the tools that I sneaked inside my school bag .
And they would be somethings like saws , knives , sickles and axes that I covered up with a piece of towel .
I would bring the branches home , riding buses and subways , barely holding them in my hands .
And I did not bring the tools here to Long Beach .
Airport security .
In the privacy of my room , covered in sawdust , I would saw , trim and polish wood all night long until a bow took shape .
One day , I was changing the shape of a bamboo piece and ended up setting the place on fire .
Where ? The rooftop of my apartment building , a place where 96 families call home .
A customer from a department store across from my building called 911 , and I ran downstairs to tell my mom with half of my hair burned .
I want to take this opportunity to tell my mom , in the audience today : Mom , I was really sorry , and I will be more careful with open fire from now on .
My mother had to do a lot of explaining , telling people that her son did not commit a premeditated arson .
I also researched extensively on bows around the world .
In that process , I tried to combine the different bows from across time and places to create the most effective bow .
I also worked with many different types of wood , such as maple , yew and mulberry , and did many shooting experiments in the wooded area near the urban expressway that I mentioned before .
The most effective bow for me would be like this .
One : Curved tips can maximize the springiness when you draw and shoot the arrow .
Two : Belly is drawn inward for higher draw weight , which means more power .
Three : Sinew used in the outer layer of the limb for maximum tension storage .
And four : Horn used to store energy in compression .
After fixing , breaking , redesigning , mending , bending and amending , my ideal bow began to take shape , and when it was finally done , it looked like this .
I was so proud of myself for inventing a perfect bow on my own .
This is a picture of Korean traditional bows taken from a museum , and see how my bow resembles them .
Thanks to my ancestors for robbing me of my invention .
Through bowmaking , I came in contact with part of my heritage .
Learning the information that has accumulated over time and reading the message left by my ancestors were better than any consolation therapy or piece of advice any living adults could give me .
You see , I searched far and wide , but never bothered to look close and near .
From this realization , I began to take interest in Korean history , which had never inspired me before .
In the end , the grass is often greener on my side of the fence , although we don &apos;t realize it .
Now , I am going to show you how my bow works .
And let &apos;s see how this one works .
This is a bamboo bow , with 45-pound draw weights .
A bow may function in a simple mechanism , but in order to make a good bow , a great amount of sensitivity is required .
You need to console and communicate with the wood material .
Each fiber in the wood has its own reason and function for being , and only through cooperation and harmony among them comes a great bow .
I may be an &#91; odd &#93; student with unconventional interests , but I hope I am making a contribution by sharing my story with all of you .
My ideal world is a place where no one is left behind , where everyone is needed exactly where they are , like the fibers and the tendons in a bow , a place where the strong is flexible and the vulnerable is resilient .
The bow resembles me , and I resemble the bow .
Now , I am shooting a part of myself to you .
No , better yet , a part of my mind has just been shot over to your mind .
Did it strike you ?
Thank you .
Erin McKean : The joy of lexicography
Is the beloved paper dictionary doomed to extinction ? In this infectiously exuberant talk , leading lexicographer Erin McKean looks at the many ways today &apos;s print dictionary is poised for transformation .
Now , have any of y &apos;all ever looked up this word ?
You know , in a dictionary ? Yeah , that &apos;s what I thought .
How about this word ?
Here , I &apos;ll show it to you .
Lexicography : the practice of compiling dictionaries .
Notice -- we &apos;re very specific -- that word &quot; compile . &quot;
The dictionary is not carved out of a piece of granite , out of a lump of rock . It &apos;s made up of lots of little bits .
It &apos;s little discrete -- that &apos;s spelled D-I-S-C-R-E-T-E -- bits .
And those bits are words .
Now one of the perks of being a lexicographer -- besides getting to come to TED -- is that you get to say really fun words , like lexicographical .
Lexicographical has this great pattern : it &apos;s called a double dactyl . And just by saying double dactyl , I &apos;ve sent the geek needle all the way into the red .
But &quot; lexicographical &quot; is the same pattern as &quot; higgledy-piggledy . &quot;
Right ? It &apos;s a fun word to say , and I get to say it a lot .
Now , one of the non-perks of being a lexicographer is that people don &apos;t usually have a kind of warm , fuzzy , snuggly image of the dictionary .
Right ? Nobody hugs their dictionaries .
But what people really often think about the dictionary is , they think more like this .
Just to let you know , I do not have a lexicographical whistle .
But people think that my job is to let the good words make that difficult left-hand turn into the dictionary , and keep the bad words out .
But the thing is , I don &apos;t want to be a traffic cop .
For one thing , I just do not do uniforms .
And for another , deciding what words are good and what words are bad is actually not very easy .
And it &apos;s not very fun . And when parts of your job are not easy or fun , you kind of look for an excuse not to do them .
So if I had to think of some kind of occupation as a metaphor for my work , I would much rather be a fisherman .
I want to throw my big net into the deep , blue ocean of English and see what marvelous creatures I can drag up from the bottom .
But why do people want me to direct traffic , when I would much rather go fishing ?
Well , I blame the Queen .
Why do I blame the Queen ?
Well , first of all , I blame the Queen because it &apos;s funny .
But secondly , I blame the Queen because dictionaries have really not changed .
Our idea of what a dictionary is has not changed since her reign .
The only thing that Queen Victoria would not be amused by in modern dictionaries is our inclusion of the F-word , which has happened in American dictionaries since 1965 .
So , there &apos;s this guy , right ? Victorian era .
James Murray , first editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
I do not have that hat . I wish I had that hat .
So he &apos;s really responsible for a lot of what we consider modern in dictionaries today .
When a guy who looks like that , in that hat , is the face of modernity , you have a problem .
And so , James Murray could get a job on any dictionary today .
There &apos;d be virtually no learning curve .
And of course , a few of us are saying : okay , computers !
Computers ! What about computers ?
The thing about computers is , I love computers .
I mean , I &apos;m a huge geek , I love computers .
I would go on a hunger strike before I let them take away Google Book Search from me .
But computers don &apos;t do much else other than speed up the process of compiling dictionaries .
They don &apos;t change the end result .
Because what a dictionary is , is it &apos;s Victorian design merged with a little bit of modern propulsion .
It &apos;s steampunk . What we have is an electric velocipede .
You know , we have Victorian design with an engine on it . That &apos;s all !
The design has not changed .
And OK , what about online dictionaries , right ?
Online dictionaries must be different .
This is the Oxford English Dictionary Online , one of the best online dictionaries .
This is my favorite word , by the way .
Erinaceous : pertaining to the hedgehog family ; of the nature of a hedgehog .
Very useful word . So , look at that .
Online dictionaries right now are paper thrown up on a screen .
This is flat . Look how many links there are in the actual entry : two !
Right ? Those little buttons , I had them all expanded except for the date chart .
So there &apos;s not very much going on here .
There &apos;s not a lot of clickiness .
And in fact , online dictionaries replicate almost all the problems of print , except for searchability .
And when you improve searchability , you actually take away the one advantage of print , which is serendipity .
Serendipity is when you find things you weren &apos;t looking for , because finding what you are looking for is so damned difficult .
So -- -- now , when you think about this , what we have here is a ham butt problem .
Does everyone know the ham butt problem ?
Woman &apos;s making a ham for a big , family dinner .
She goes to cut the butt off the ham and throw it away , and she looks at this piece of ham and she &apos;s like , &quot; This is a perfectly good piece of ham . Why am I throwing this away ? &quot;
She thought , &quot; Well , my mom always did this . &quot;
So she calls up mom , and she says , &quot; Mom , why &apos;d you cut the butt off the ham , when you &apos;re making a ham ? &quot;
She says , &quot; I don &apos;t know , my mom always did it ! &quot;
So they call grandma , and grandma says , &quot; My pan was too small ! &quot;
So , it &apos;s not that we have good words and bad words .
We have a pan that &apos;s too small !
You know , that ham butt is delicious ! There &apos;s no reason to throw it away .
The bad words -- see , when people think about a place and they don &apos;t find a place on the map , they think , &quot; This map sucks ! &quot;
When they find a nightspot or a bar , and it &apos;s not in the guidebook , they &apos;re like , &quot; Ooh , this place must be cool ! It &apos;s not in the guidebook . &quot;
When they find a word that &apos;s not in the dictionary , they think , &quot; This must be a bad word . &quot; Why ? It &apos;s more likely to be a bad dictionary .
Why are you blaming the ham for being too big for the pan ?
So , you can &apos;t get a smaller ham .
The English language is as big as it is .
So , if you have a ham butt problem , and you &apos;re thinking about the ham butt problem , the conclusion that it leads you to is inexorable and counterintuitive : paper is the enemy of words .
How can this be ? I mean , I love books . I really love books .
Some of my best friends are books .
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
Now they &apos;re going to think &quot; Oh , boy .
People are going to take away my beautiful , paper dictionaries ? &quot;
No . There will still be paper dictionaries .
When we had cars -- when cars became the dominant mode of transportation , we didn &apos;t round up all the horses and shoot them .
You know , there &apos;re still going to be paper dictionaries , but it &apos;s not going to be the dominant dictionary .
The book-shaped dictionary is not going to be the only shape dictionaries come in . And it &apos;s not going to be the prototype for the shapes dictionaries come in .
So , think about it this way : if you &apos;ve got an artificial constraint , artificial constraints lead to arbitrary distinctions and a skewed worldview .
What if biologists could only study animals that made people go , &quot; Aww . &quot; Right ?
What if we made aesthetic judgments about animals , and only the ones we thought were cute were the ones that we could study ?
We &apos;d know a whole lot about charismatic megafauna , and not very much about much else .
And I think this is a problem .
I think we should study all the words , because when you think about words , you can make beautiful expressions from very humble parts .
Lexicography is really more about material science .
We are studying the tolerances of the materials that you use to build the structure of your expression : your speeches and your writing . And then , often people say to me , &quot; Well , OK , how do I know that this word is real ? &quot;
They think , &quot; OK , if we think words are the tools that we use to build the expressions of our thoughts , how can you say that screwdrivers are better than hammers ?
How can you say that a sledgehammer is better than a ball-peen hammer ? &quot;
They &apos;re just the right tools for the job .
And so people say to me , &quot; How do I know if a word is real ? &quot;
You know , anybody who &apos;s read a children &apos;s book knows that love makes things real .
If you love a word , use it . That makes it real .
Being in the dictionary is an artificial distinction .
It doesn &apos;t make a word any more real than any other way .
If you love a word , it becomes real .
So if we &apos;re not worrying about directing traffic , if we &apos;ve transcended paper , if we are worrying less about control and more about description , then we can think of the English language as being this beautiful mobile .
And any time one of those little parts of the mobile changes , is touched , any time you touch a word , you use it in a new context , you give it a new connotation , you verb it , you make the mobile move .
You didn &apos;t break it . It &apos;s just in a new position , and that new position can be just as beautiful .
Now , if you &apos;re no longer a traffic cop -- the problem with being a traffic cop is there can only be so many traffic cops in any one intersection , or the cars get confused . Right ?
But if your goal is no longer to direct the traffic , but maybe to count the cars that go by , then more eyeballs are better .
You can ask for help !
If you ask for help , you get more done . And we really need help .
Library of Congress : 17 million books , of which half are in English .
If only one out of every 10 of those books had a word that &apos;s not in the dictionary in it , that would be equivalent to more than two unabridged dictionaries .
And I find an un-dictionaried word -- a word like &quot; un-dictionaried , &quot; for example -- in almost every book I read . What about newspapers ?
Newspaper archive goes back to 1759 , 58.1 million newspaper pages . If only one in 100 of those pages had an un-dictionaried word on it , it would be an entire other OED .
That &apos;s 500,000 more words . So that &apos;s a lot .
And I &apos;m not even talking about magazines . I &apos;m not talking about blogs -- and I find more new words on BoingBoing in a given week than I do Newsweek or Time .
There &apos;s a lot going on there .
And I &apos;m not even talking about polysemy , which is the greedy habit some words have of taking more than one meaning for themselves .
So if you think of the word &quot; set , &quot; a set can be a badger &apos;s burrow , a set can be one of the pleats in an Elizabethan ruff , and there &apos;s one numbered definition in the OED .
The OED has 33 different numbered definitions for set .
Tiny , little word , 33 numbered definitions .
One of them is just labeled &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
Do you know what that says to me ?
That says to me , it was Friday afternoon and somebody wanted to go down the pub .
That &apos;s a lexicographical cop out , to say , &quot; miscellaneous technical senses . &quot;
So , we have all these words , and we really need help !
And the thing is , we could ask for help -- asking for help &apos;s not that hard .
I mean , lexicography is not rocket science .
See , I just gave you a lot of words and a lot of numbers , and this is more of a visual explanation .
If we think of the dictionary as being the map of the English language , these bright spots are what we know about , and the dark spots are where we are in the dark .
If that was the map of all the words in American English , we don &apos;t know very much .
And we don &apos;t even know the shape of the language .
If this was the dictionary -- if this was the map of American English -- look , we have a kind of lumpy idea of Florida , but there &apos;s no California !
We &apos;re missing California from American English .
We just don &apos;t know enough , and we don &apos;t even know that we &apos;re missing California .
We don &apos;t even see that there &apos;s a gap on the map .
So again , lexicography is not rocket science .
But even if it were , rocket science is being done by dedicated amateurs these days . You know ?
It can &apos;t be that hard to find some words !
So , enough scientists in other disciplines are really asking people to help , and they &apos;re doing a good job of it .
For instance , there &apos;s eBird , where amateur birdwatchers can upload information about their bird sightings .
And then , ornithologists can go and help track populations , migrations , etc .
And there &apos;s this guy , Mike Oates . Mike Oates lives in the U.K.
He &apos;s a director of an electroplating company .
He &apos;s found more than 140 comets .
He &apos;s found so many comets , they named a comet after him .
It &apos;s kind of out past Mars . It &apos;s a hike .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;s getting his picture taken there anytime soon .
But he found 140 comets without a telescope .
He downloaded data from the NASA SOHO satellite , and that &apos;s how he found them .
If we can find comets without a telescope , shouldn &apos;t we be able to find words ?
Now , y &apos;all know where I &apos;m going with this .
Because I &apos;m going to the Internet , which is where everybody goes .
And the Internet is great for collecting words , because the Internet &apos;s full of collectors .
And this is a little-known technological fact about the Internet , but the Internet is actually made up of words and enthusiasm .
And words and enthusiasm actually happen to be the recipe for lexicography . Isn &apos;t that great ?
So there are a lot of really good word-collecting sites out there right now , but the problem with some of them is that they &apos;re not scientific enough .
They show the word , but they don &apos;t show any context .
Where did it come from ? Who said it ?
What newspaper was it in ? What book ?
Because a word is like an archaeological artifact .
If you don &apos;t know the provenance or the source of the artifact , it &apos;s not science , it &apos;s a pretty thing to look at .
So a word without its source is like a cut flower .
You know , it &apos;s pretty to look at for a while , but then it dies .
It dies too fast .
So , this whole time I &apos;ve been saying , &quot; The dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary , the dictionary . &quot;
Not &quot; a dictionary , &quot; or &quot; dictionaries . &quot; And that &apos;s because , well , people use the dictionary to stand for the whole language .
They use it synecdochically .
And one of the problems of knowing a word like &quot; synecdochically &quot; is that you really want an excuse to say &quot; synecdochically . &quot;
This whole talk has just been an excuse to get me to the point where I could say &quot; synecdochically &quot; to all of you .
So I &apos;m really sorry . But when you use a part of something -- like the dictionary is a part of the language , or a flag stands for the United States , it &apos;s a symbol of the country -- then you &apos;re using it synecdochically .
But the thing is , we could make the dictionary the whole language .
If we get a bigger pan , then we can put all the words in .
We can put in all the meanings .
Doesn &apos;t everyone want more meaning in their lives ?
And we can make the dictionary not just be a symbol of the language -- we can make it be the whole language .
You see , what I &apos;m really hoping for is that my son , who turns seven this month -- I want him to barely remember that this is the form factor that dictionaries used to come in .
This is what dictionaries used to look like .
I want him to think of this kind of dictionary as an eight-track tape .
It &apos;s a format that died because it wasn &apos;t useful enough .
It wasn &apos;t really what people needed .
And the thing is , if we can put in all the words , no longer have that artificial distinction between good and bad , we can really describe the language like scientists .
We can leave the aesthetic judgments to the writers and the speakers .
If we can do that , then I can spend all my time fishing , and I don &apos;t have to be a traffic cop anymore .
Thank you very much for your kind attention .
Angela Belcher : Using nature to grow batteries
Inspired by an abalone shell , Angela Belcher programs viruses to make elegant nanoscale structures that humans can use . Selecting for high-performing genes through directed evolution , she &apos;s produced viruses that can construct powerful new batteries , clean hydrogen fuels and record-breaking solar cells . In her talk , she shows us how it &apos;s done .
I thought I would talk a little bit about how nature makes materials .
I brought along with me an abalone shell .
This abalone shell is a biocomposite material that &apos;s 98 percent by mass calcium carbonate and two percent by mass protein .
Yet , it &apos;s 3,000 times tougher than its geological counterpart .
And a lot of people might use structures like abalone shells , like chalk .
I &apos;ve been fascinated by how nature makes materials , and there &apos;s a lot of sequence to how they do such an exquisite job .
Part of it is that these materials are macroscopic in structure , but they &apos;re formed at the nanoscale .
They &apos;re formed at the nanoscale , and they use proteins that are coded by the genetic level that allow them to build these really exquisite structures .
So something I think is very fascinating is what if you could give life to non-living structures , like batteries and like solar cells ?
What if they had some of the same capabilities that an abalone shell did , in terms of being able to build really exquisite structures at room temperature and room pressure , using non-toxic chemicals and adding no toxic materials back into the environment ?
So that &apos;s the vision that I &apos;ve been thinking about .
And so what if you could grow a battery in a Petri dish ?
Or , what if you could give genetic information to a battery so that it could actually become better as a function of time , and do so in an environmentally friendly way ?
And so , going back to this abalone shell , besides being nano-structured , one thing that &apos;s fascinating , is when a male and a female abalone get together , they pass on the genetic information that says , &quot; This is how to build an exquisite material .
Here &apos;s how to do it at room temperature and pressure , using non-toxic materials . &quot;
Same with diatoms , which are shown right here , which are glasseous structures .
Every time the diatoms replicate , they give the genetic information that says , &quot; Here &apos;s how to build glass in the ocean that &apos;s perfectly nano-structured .
And you can do it the same , over and over again . &quot;
So what if you could do the same thing with a solar cell or a battery ?
I like to say my favorite biomaterial is my four year-old .
But anyone who &apos;s ever had , or knows , small children knows they &apos;re incredibly complex organisms .
And so if you wanted to convince them to do something they don &apos;t want to do , it &apos;s very difficult .
So when we think about future technologies , we actually think of using bacteria and virus , simple organisms .
Can you convince them to work with a new toolbox , so that they can build a structure that will be important to me ?
Also , when we think about future technologies , we start with the beginning of Earth .
Basically , it took a billion years to have life on Earth .
And very rapidly , they became multi-cellular , they could replicate , they could use photosynthesis as a way of getting their energy source .
But it wasn &apos;t until about 500 million years ago -- during the Cambrian geologic time period -- that organisms in the ocean started making hard materials .
Before that , they were all soft , fluffy structures .
And it was during this time that there was increased calcium and iron and silicon in the environment , and organisms learned how to make hard materials .
And so that &apos;s what I would like be able to do -- convince biology to work with the rest of the periodic table .
Now if you look at biology , there &apos;s many structures like DNA and antibodies and proteins and ribosomes that you &apos;ve heard about that are already nano-structured .
So nature already gives us really exquisite structures on the nanoscale .
What if we could harness them and convince them to not be an antibody that does something like HIV ?
But what if we could convince them to build a solar cell for us ?
So here are some examples : these are some natural shells .
There are natural biological materials .
The abalone shell here -- and if you fracture it , you can look at the fact that it &apos;s nano-structured .
There &apos;s diatoms made out of SIO2 , and they &apos;re magnetotactic bacteria that make small , single-domain magnets used for navigation .
What all these have in common is these materials are structured at the nanoscale , and they have a DNA sequence that codes for a protein sequence that gives them the blueprint to be able to build these really wonderful structures .
Now , going back to the abalone shell , the abalone makes this shell by having these proteins .
These proteins are very negatively charged .
And they can pull calcium out of the environment , put down a layer of calcium and then carbonate , calcium and carbonate .
It has the chemical sequences of amino acids , which says , &quot; This is how to build the structure .
Here &apos;s the DNA sequence , here &apos;s the protein sequence in order to do it . &quot;
And so an interesting idea is , what if you could take any material that you wanted , or any element on the periodic table , and find its corresponding DNA sequence , then code it for a corresponding protein sequence to build a structure , but not build an abalone shell -- build something that , through nature , it has never had the opportunity to work with yet .
And so here &apos;s the periodic table .
And I absolutely love the periodic table .
Every year for the incoming freshman class at MIT , I have a periodic table made that says , &quot; Welcome to MIT . Now you &apos;re in your element . &quot;
And you flip it over , and it &apos;s the amino acids with the PH at which they have different charges .
And so I give this out to thousands of people .
And I know it says MIT , and this is Caltech , but I have a couple extra if people want it .
And I was really fortunate to have President Obama visit my lab this year on his visit to MIT , and I really wanted to give him a periodic table .
So I stayed up at night , and I talked to my husband , &quot; How do I give President Obama a periodic table ?
What if he says , &apos; Oh , I already have one , &apos; or , &apos; I &apos;ve already memorized it &apos; ? &quot;
And so he came to visit my lab and looked around -- it was a great visit .
And then afterward , I said , &quot; Sir , I want to give you the periodic table in case you &apos;re ever in a bind and need to calculate molecular weight . &quot;
And I thought molecular weight sounded much less nerdy than molar mass .
And so he looked at it , and he said , &quot; Thank you . I &apos;ll look at it periodically . &quot;
And later in a lecture that he gave on clean energy , he pulled it out and said , &quot; And people at MIT , they give out periodic tables . &quot;
So basically what I didn &apos;t tell you is that about 500 million years ago , organisms starter making materials , but it took them about 50 million years to get good at it .
It took them about 50 million years to learn how to perfect how to make that abalone shell .
And that &apos;s a hard sell to a graduate student .
&quot; I have this great project -- 50 million years . &quot;
And so we had to develop a way of trying to do this more rapidly .
And so we use a virus that &apos;s a non-toxic virus called M13 bacteriophage that &apos;s job is to infect bacteria .
Well it has a simple DNA structure that you can go in and cut and paste additional DNA sequences into it .
And by doing that , it allows the virus to express random protein sequences .
And this is pretty easy biotechnology .
And you could basically do this a billion times .
And so you can go in and have a billion different viruses that are all genetically identical , but they differ from each other based on their tips , on one sequence that codes for one protein .
Now if you take all billion viruses , and you can put them in one drop of liquid , you can force them to interact with anything you want on the periodic table .
And through a process of selection evolution , you can pull one out of a billion that does something that you &apos;d like it to do , like grow a battery or grow a solar cell .
So basically , viruses can &apos;t replicate themselves ; they need a host .
Once you find that one out of a billion , you infect it into a bacteria , and you make millions and billions of copies of that particular sequence .
And so the other thing that &apos;s beautiful about biology is that biology gives you really exquisite structures with nice link scales .
And these viruses are long and skinny , and we can get them to express the ability to grow something like semiconductors or materials for batteries .
Now this is a high-powered battery that we grew in my lab .
We engineered a virus to pick up carbon nanotubes .
So one part of the virus grabs a carbon nanotube .
The other part of the virus has a sequence that can grow an electrode material for a battery .
And then it wires itself to the current collector .
And so through a process of selection evolution , we went from being able to have a virus that made a crummy battery to a virus that made a good battery to a virus that made a record-breaking , high-powered battery that &apos;s all made at room temperature , basically at the bench top .
And that battery went to the White House for a press conference .
I brought it here .
You can see it in this case -- that &apos;s lighting this LED .
Now if we could scale this , you could actually use it to run your Prius , which is my dream -- to be able to drive a virus-powered car .
But it &apos;s basically -- you can pull one out of a billion .
You can make lots of amplifications to it .
Basically , you make an amplification in the lab , and then you get it to self-assemble into a structure like a battery .
We &apos;re able to do this also with catalysis .
This is the example of photocatalytic splitting of water .
And what we &apos;ve been able to do is engineer a virus to basically take dye-absorbing molecules and line them up on the surface of the virus so it acts as an antenna , and you get an energy transfer across the virus .
And then we give it a second gene to grow an inorganic material that can be used to split water into oxygen and hydrogen that can be used for clean fuels .
And I brought an example with me of that today .
My students promised me it would work .
These are virus-assembled nanowires .
When you shine light on them , you can see them bubbling .
In this case , you &apos;re seeing oxygen bubbles come out .
And basically , by controlling the genes , you can control multiple materials to improve your device performance .
The last example are solar cells .
You can also do this with solar cells .
We &apos;ve been able to engineer viruses to pick up carbon nanotubes and then grow titanium dioxide around them -- and use as a way of getting electrons through the device .
And what we &apos;ve found is through genetic engineering , we can actually increase the efficiencies of these solar cells to record numbers for these types of dye-sensitized systems .
And I brought one of those as well that you can play around with outside afterward .
So this is a virus-based solar cell .
Through evolution and selection , we took it from an eight percent efficiency solar cell to an 11 percent efficiency solar cell .
So I hope that I &apos;ve convinced you that there &apos;s a lot of great , interesting things to be learned about how nature makes materials -- and taking it the next step to see if you can force , or whether you can take advantage of how nature makes materials , to make things that nature hasn &apos;t yet dreamed of making .
Thank you .
Stefan Sagmeister : Happiness by design
Graphic designer Stefan Sagmeister takes the audience on a whimsical journey through moments of his life that made him happy -- and notes how many of these moments have to do with good design .
About 15 years ago , I went to visit a friend in Hong Kong .
And at the time I was very superstitious .
So , upon landing -- this was still at the old Hong Kong airport that &apos;s Kai Tak , when it was smack in the middle of the city -- I thought , &quot; If I see something good , I &apos;m going to have a great time here in my two weeks . And if I see something negative , I &apos;m going to be miserable , indeed . &quot;
So the plane landed in between the buildings and got to a full stop in front of this little billboard .
And I actually went to see some of the design companies in Hong Kong in my stay there .
And it turned out that -- I just went to see , you know , what they are doing in Hong Kong .
But I actually walked away with a great job offer .
And I flew back to Austria , packed my bags , and , another week later , I was again on my way to Hong Kong still superstitions and thinking , &quot; Well , if that &apos; Winner &apos; billboard is still up , I &apos;m going to have a good time working here .
But if it &apos;s gone , it &apos;s going to be really miserable and stressful . &quot;
So it turned out that not only was the billboard still up but they had put this one right next to it .
On the other hand , it also taught me where superstition gets me because I really had a terrible time in Hong Kong .
However , I did have a number of real moments of happiness in my life -- of , you know , I think what the conference brochure refers to as &quot; moments that take your breath away . &quot;
And since I &apos;m a big list maker , I actually listed them all .
Now , you don &apos;t have to go through the trouble of reading them and I won &apos;t read them for you .
I know that it &apos;s incredibly boring to hear about other people &apos;s happinesses .
What I did do , though is , I actually looked at them from a design standpoint and just eliminated all the ones that had nothing to do with design .
And , very surprisingly , over half of them had , actually , something to do with design .
So there are , of course , two different possibilities .
There &apos;s one from a consumer &apos;s point of view -- where I was happy while experiencing design .
And I &apos;ll just give you one example . I had gotten my first Walkman .
This is 1983 .
My brother had this great Yamaha motorcycle that he was willing to borrow to me freely .
And The Police &apos;s &quot; Synchronicity &quot; cassette had just been released and there was no helmet law in my hometown of Bregenz .
So you could drive up into the mountains freely blasting The Police on the new Sony Walkman .
And I remember it as a true moment of happiness .
You know , of course , they are related to this combination of at least two of them being , you know , design objects .
And , you know , there &apos;s a scale of happiness when you talk about in design but the motorcycle incident would definitely be , you know , situated somewhere here -- right in there between Delight and Bliss .
Now , there is the other part , from a designer &apos;s standpoint -- if you &apos;re happy while actually doing it .
And one way to see how happy designers are when they &apos;re designing could be to look at the authors &apos; photos on the back of their monographs ?
So , according to this , the Australians and the Japanese as well as the Mexicans are very happy .
While , somewhat , the Spaniards ...
and , I think , particularly , the Swiss , don &apos;t seem to be doing all that well .
Last November , a museum opened in Tokyo called The Mori Museum , in a skyscraper , up on the 56th floor .
And their inaugural exhibit was called &quot; Happiness . &quot;
And I went , very eagerly , to see it , because -- well , also , with an eye on this conference .
And they interestingly sectioned the exhibit off into four different areas .
Under &quot; Arcadia , &quot; they showed things like this , from the Edo period -- a hundred ways to write &quot; happiness &quot; in different forms .
Or they had this apple by Yoko Ono -- that , of course , later on was , you know , made into the label for The Beatles .
Under &quot; Nirvana &quot; they showed this Constable painting .
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
This is a blue field -- it &apos;s actually an Yves Klein painting .
And the theory was that if you abstract an image , you really , you know open as much room for the un-representable -- and , therefore , you know , are able to involve the viewer more .
Then , under &quot; Desire , &quot; they showed these Shunsho paintings -- also from the Edo period -- ink on silk .
And , lastly , under &quot; Harmony , &quot; they had this 13th-century mandala from Tibet .
Now , what I took away from the exhibit was that maybe with the exception of the mandala most of the pieces in there were actually about the visualization of happiness and not about happiness .
And I felt a little bit cheated , because the visualization -- that &apos;s a really easy thing to do .
And , you know , my studio -- we &apos;ve done it all the time .
This is , you know , a book .
A happy dog -- and you take it out , it &apos;s an aggressive dog .
It &apos;s a happy David Byrne and an angry David Byrne .
Or a jazz poster with a happy face and a more aggressive face .
You know , that &apos;s not a big deal to accomplish .
It has gotten to the point where , you know , within advertising or within the movie industry , &quot; happy &quot; has gotten such a bad reputation that if you actually want to do something with the subject and still appear authentic , you almost would have to , you know , do it from a cynical point of view .
This is , you know , the movie poster .
Or we , a couple of weeks ago , designed a box set for The Talking Heads where the happiness visualized on the cover definitely has , very much , a dark side to it .
Much , much more difficult is this , where the designs actually can evoke happiness -- and I &apos;m going to just show you three that actually did this for me .
This is a campaign done by a young artist in New York , who calls himself &quot; True . &quot;
Everybody who has ridden the New York subway system will be familiar with these signs ?
True printed his own version of these signs .
Met every Wednesday at a subway stop with 20 of his friends .
They divided up the different subway lines and added their own version .
So this is one .
Now , the way this works in the system is that nobody ever looks at these signs .
So you &apos;re you &apos;re really bored in the subway , and you kind of stare at something .
And it takes you a while until it actually -- you realize that this says something different than what it normally says .
I mean , that &apos;s , at least , how it made me happy .
Now , True is a real humanitarian .
He didn &apos;t want any of his friends to be arrested , so he supplied everybody with this fake volunteer card .
And also gave this fake letter from the MTA to everybody -- sort of like pretending that it &apos;s an art project financed by The Metropolitan Transit Authority .
Another New York project .
This is at P.S. 1 -- a sculpture that &apos;s basically a square room by James Turrell , that has a retractable ceiling .
Opens up at dusk and dawn every day .
You don &apos;t see the horizon .
You &apos;re just in there , watching the incredible , subtle changes of color in the sky .
And the room is truly something to be seen .
People &apos;s demeanor changes when they go in there .
And , for sure , I haven &apos;t looked at the sky in the same way after spending an hour in there .
There are , of course , more than those three projects that I &apos;m showing here .
I would definitely say that observing Vik Muniz &apos; &quot; Cloud &quot; a couple of years ago in Manhattan for sure made me happy , as well .
But my last project is , again , from a young designer in New York .
He &apos;s from Korea originally .
And he took it upon himself to print 55,000 speech bubbles -- empty speech bubbles stickers , large ones and small ones .
And he goes around New York and just puts them , empty as they are , on posters .
And other people go and fill them in .
This one says , &quot; Please let me die in peace . &quot;
I think that was -- the most surprising to myself was that the writing was actually so good .
This is on a musician poster , that says : &quot; I am concerned that my CD will not sell more than 200,000 units and that , as a result , my recoupable advance from my label will be taken from me , after which , my contract will be cancelled , and I &apos;ll be back doing Journey covers on Bleecker Street . &quot;
I think the reason this works so well is because everybody involved wins .
Jee gets to have his project ; the public gets a sweeter environment ; and different public gets a place to express itself ; and the advertisers finally get somebody to look at their ads .
Well , there was a question , of course , that was on my mind for a while : You know , can I do more of the things that I like doing in design and less of the ones that I don &apos;t like to be doing ?
Which brought me back to my list making -- you know , just to see what I actually like about my job .
You know , one is : just working without pressure .
Then : working concentrated , without being frazzled .
Or , as Nancy said before , like really immerse oneself into it .
Try not to get stuck doing the same thing -- or try not get stuck behind the computer all day .
This is , you know , related to it : getting out of the studio .
Then , of course , trying to , you know , work on things where the content is actually important for me .
And being able to enjoy the end results .
And then I found another list in one of my diaries that actually contained all the things that I thought I learned in my life so far .
And , just about at that time , an Austrian magazine called and asked if we would want to do six spreads -- design six spreads that work like dividing pages between the different chapters in the magazine ?
And the whole thing just fell together .
So I just picked one of the things that I thought I learned -- in this case , &quot; Everything I do always comes back to me &quot; -- and we made these spreads right out of this .
So it was : &quot; Everything I do always comes back to me . &quot;
A couple of weeks ago , a French company asked us to design five billboards for them .
Again , we could supply the content for it .
So I just picked another one .
And this was two weeks ago .
We flew to Arizona -- the designer who works with me , and myself -- and photographed this one .
So it &apos;s : &quot; Trying to look good limits my life . &quot;
And then we did one more of these .
This is , again , for a magazine , dividing pages .
This is : &quot; Having &quot; -- this is the same thing ; it &apos;s just , you know , photographed from the side .
This is from the front .
Again , it &apos;s the same thing -- &quot; guts &quot; is just the same room , reworked .
Then it &apos;s : &quot; always works out . &quot;
Then it &apos;s &quot; for , &quot; with the light on .
And it &apos;s &quot; me . &quot;
Thank you so much .
Stephen Hawking &apos;s zero g flight
X Prize founder Peter Diamandis talks about how he helped Stephen Hawking fulfill his dream of going to space -- by flying together into the upper atmosphere and experiencing weightlessness at zero g .
Those of you who know me know how passionate I am about opening the space frontier .
So when I had the chance to give the world &apos;s expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity , it was incredible .
And I want to tell you that story .
I first met him through the Archon X PRIZE for Genomics .
It &apos;s a competition we &apos;re holding , the second X PRIZE , for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days .
We have something called the Genome 100 -- 100 individuals we &apos;re sequencing as part of that .
Craig Venter chairs that event .
And I met Professor Hawking , and he said his dream was to travel into space .
And I said , &quot; I can &apos;t take you there , but I can take you into weightlessness into zero-g .
And he said , on the spot , &quot; Absolutely , yes . &quot;
Well , the only way to experience zero-g on Earth is actually with parabolic flight , weightless flight .
You take an airplane , you fly over the top , you &apos;re weightless for 25 seconds .
Come back down , you weigh twice as much .
You do it again and again .
You can get eight , 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how NASA &apos;s trained their astronauts for so long .
We set out to do this .
It took us 11 years to become operational .
And we announced that we were going to fly Stephen Hawking .
We had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say , you &apos;re crazy , don &apos;t do that , you &apos;re going kill the guy .
And he wanted to go .
We worked hard to get all the permissions .
And six months later , we sat down at Kennedy Space Center .
We had a press conference , we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola , give him 25 seconds of zero-g .
And if it went really well , we might do three parabolas .
Well , we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this .
And what he said , for me , was very moving .
He said , &quot; Life on Earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster ...
I think the human race doesn &apos;t have a future if it doesn &apos;t go into space .
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space . &quot;
We took him out to the Kennedy Space Center , up inside the NASA vehicle , into the back of the zero-g airplane .
We had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $ 150,000 in donations for children &apos;s charities -- who flew with us .
A few TEDsters here .
We set up a whole ER .
We had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane .
We were monitoring his PO2 of his blood , his heart rate , his blood pressure .
We had everything all set in case of an emergency ; God knows , you don &apos;t want to hurt this world-renowned expert .
We took off from the shuttle landing facility , where the shuttle takes off and lands .
And my partner Byron Lichtenberg and I carefully suspended him into zero-g .
Once he was there , &#91; we &#93; let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like .
And after that first parabola , you know , the doc said everything is great . He was smiling , and we said go .
So we did a second parabola .
And a third .
We actually floated an apple in homage to Sir Isaac Newton because Professor Hawking holds the same chair at Cambridge that Isaac Newton did .
And we did a fourth , and a fifth and a sixth .
And a seventh and an eighth .
And this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man .
He was so happy .
We are living on a precious jewel , and it &apos;s during our lifetime that we &apos;re moving off this planet .
Please join us in this epic adventure .
Thank you so much .
Matt Killingsworth : Want to be happier ? Stay in the moment
When are humans most happy ? To gather data on this question , Matt Killingsworth built an app , Track Your Happiness , that let people report their feelings in real time . Among the surprising results : We &apos;re often happiest when we &apos;re lost in the moment . And the flip side : The more our mind wanders , the less happy we can be . &amp; lt ; i &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / i &amp; gt ;
So , people want a lot of things out of life , but I think , more than anything else , they want happiness .
Aristotle called happiness &quot; the chief good , &quot; the end towards which all other things aim .
According to this view , the reason we want a big house or a nice car or a good job isn &apos;t that these things are intrinsically valuable .
It &apos;s that we expect them to bring us happiness .
Now in the last 50 years , we Americans have gotten a lot of the things that we want . We &apos;re richer .
We live longer . We have access to technology that would have seemed like science fiction just a few years ago .
The paradox of happiness is that even though the objective conditions of our lives have improved dramatically , we haven &apos;t actually gotten any happier .
Maybe because these conventional notions of progress haven &apos;t delivered big benefits in terms of happiness , there &apos;s been an increased interest in recent years in happiness itself .
People have been debating the causes of happiness for a really long time , in fact for thousands of years , but it seems like many of those debates remain unresolved .
Well , as with many other domains in life , I think the scientific method has the potential to answer this question .
In fact , in the last few years , there &apos;s been an explosion in research on happiness . For example , we &apos;ve learned a lot about its demographics , how things like income and education , gender and marriage relate to it .
But one of the puzzles this has revealed is that factors like these don &apos;t seem to have a particularly strong effect .
Yes , it &apos;s better to make more money rather than less , or to graduate from college instead of dropping out , but the differences in happiness tend to be small .
Which leaves the question , what are the big causes of happiness ?
I think that &apos;s a question we haven &apos;t really answered yet , but I think something that has the potential to be an answer is that maybe happiness has an awful lot to do with the contents of our moment-to-moment experiences .
It certainly seems that we &apos;re going about our lives , that what we &apos;re doing , who we &apos;re with , what we &apos;re thinking about , have a big influence on our happiness , and yet these are the very factors that have been very difficult , in fact almost impossible , for scientists to study .
A few years ago , I came up with a way to study people &apos;s happiness moment to moment as they &apos;re going about their daily lives on a massive scale all over the world , something we &apos;d never been able to do before . Called trackyourhappiness.org , it uses the iPhone to monitor people &apos;s happiness in real time .
How does this work ? Basically , I send people signals at random points throughout the day , and then I ask them a bunch of questions about their moment-to-moment experience at the instant just before the signal .
The idea is that , if we can watch how people &apos;s happiness goes up and down over the course of the day , minute to minute in some cases , and try to understand how what people are doing , who they &apos;re with , what they &apos;re thinking about , and all the other factors that describe our day , how those might relate to those changes in happiness , we might be able to discover some of the things that really have a big influence on happiness .
We &apos;ve been fortunate with this project to collect quite a lot of data , a lot more data of this kind than I think has ever been collected before , over 650,000 real-time reports from over 15,000 people .
And it &apos;s not just a lot of people , it &apos;s a really diverse group , people from a wide range of ages , from 18 to late 80s , a wide range of incomes , education levels , people who are married , divorced , widowed , etc .
They collectively represent every one of 86 occupational categories and hail from over 80 countries .
What I &apos;d like to do with the rest of my time with you today is talk a little bit about one of the areas that we &apos;ve been investigating , and that &apos;s mind-wandering .
As human beings , we have this unique ability to have our minds stray away from the present .
This guy is sitting here working on his computer , and yet he could be thinking about the vacation he had last month , wondering what he &apos;s going to have for dinner .
Maybe he &apos;s worried that he &apos;s going bald .
This ability to focus our attention on something other than the present is really amazing . It allows us to learn and plan and reason in ways that no other species of animal can .
And yet it &apos;s not clear what the relationship is between our use of this ability and our happiness .
You &apos;ve probably heard people suggest that you should stay focused on the present . &quot; Be here now , &quot; you &apos;ve probably heard a hundred times .
Maybe , to really be happy , we need to stay completely immersed and focused on our experience in the moment .
Maybe these people are right . Maybe mind-wandering is a bad thing .
On the other hand , when our minds wander , they &apos;re unconstrained . We can &apos;t change the physical reality in front of us , but we can go anywhere in our minds .
Since we know people want to be happy , maybe when our minds wander , they &apos;re going to someplace happier than the place that they &apos;re leaving . It would make a lot of sense .
In other words , maybe the pleasures of the mind allow us to increase our happiness with mind-wandering .
Well , since I &apos;m a scientist , I &apos;d like to try to resolve this debate with some data , and in particular I &apos;d like to present some data to you from three questions that I ask with Track Your Happiness . Remember , this is from sort of moment-to-moment experience in people &apos;s real lives .
There are three questions . The first one is a happiness question : How do you feel , on a scale ranging from very bad to very good ? Second , an activity question : What are you doing , on a list of 22 different activities including things like eating and working and watching TV ?
And finally a mind-wandering question : Are you thinking about something other than what you &apos;re currently doing ?
People could say no -- in other words , I &apos;m focused only on my task -- or yes -- I am thinking about something else -- and the topic of those thoughts are pleasant , neutral or unpleasant .
Any of those yes responses are what we called mind-wandering .
So what did we find ?
This graph shows happiness on the vertical axis , and you can see that bar there representing how happy people are when they &apos;re focused on the present , when they &apos;re not mind-wandering .
As it turns out , people are substantially less happy when their minds are wandering than when they &apos;re not .
Now you might look at this result and say , okay , sure , on average people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering , but surely when their minds are straying away from something that wasn &apos;t very enjoyable to begin with , at least then mind-wandering should be doing something good for us .
Nope . As it turns out , people are less happy when they &apos;re mind-wandering no matter what they &apos;re doing . For example , people don &apos;t really like commuting to work very much .
It &apos;s one of their least enjoyable activities , and yet they are substantially happier when they &apos;re focused only on their commute than when their mind is going off to something else .
It &apos;s amazing .
So how could this be happening ? I think part of the reason , a big part of the reason , is that when our minds wander , we often think about unpleasant things , and they are enormously less happy when they do that , our worries , our anxieties , our regrets , and yet even when people are thinking about something neutral , they &apos;re still considerably less happy than when they &apos;re not mind-wandering at all .
Even when they &apos;re thinking about something they would describe as pleasant , they &apos;re actually just slightly less happy than when they aren &apos;t mind-wandering .
If mind-wandering were a slot machine , it would be like having the chance to lose 50 dollars , 20 dollars or one dollar . Right ? You &apos;d never want to play .
So I &apos;ve been talking about this , suggesting , perhaps , that mind-wandering causes unhappiness , but all I &apos;ve really shown you is that these two things are correlated .
It &apos;s possible that &apos;s the case , but it might also be the case that when people are unhappy , then they mind-wander .
Maybe that &apos;s what &apos;s really going on . How could we ever disentangle these two possibilites ?
Well , one fact that we can take advantage of , I think a fact you &apos;ll all agree is true , is that time goes forward , not backward . Right ? The cause has to come before the effect .
We &apos;re lucky in this data we have many responses from each person , and so we can look and see , does mind-wandering tend to precede unhappiness , or does unhappiness tend to precede mind-wandering , to get some insight into the causal direction .
As it turns out , there is a strong relationship between mind-wandering now and being unhappy a short time later , consistent with the idea that mind-wandering is causing people to be unhappy .
In contrast , there &apos;s no relationship between being unhappy now and mind-wandering a short time later .
In other words , mind-wandering very likely seems to be an actual cause , and not merely a consequence , of unhappiness .
A few minutes ago , I likened mind-wandering to a slot machine you &apos;d never want to play .
Well , how often do people &apos;s minds wander ?
Turns out , they wander a lot . In fact , really a lot .
Forty-seven percent of the time , people are thinking about something other than what they &apos;re currently doing .
How does that depend on what people are doing ?
This shows the rate of mind-wandering across 22 activities ranging from a high of 65 percent ‚Äî ‚Äî when people are taking a shower , brushing their teeth , to 50 percent when they &apos;re working , to 40 percent when they &apos;re exercising , all the way down to this one short bar on the right that I think some of you are probably laughing at .
Ten percent of the time people &apos;s minds are wandering when they &apos;re having sex .
But there &apos;s something I think that &apos;s quite interesting in this graph , and that is , basically with one exception , no matter what people are doing , they &apos;re mind-wandering at least 30 percent of the time , which suggests , I think , that mind-wandering isn &apos;t just frequent , it &apos;s ubiquitous .
It pervades basically everything that we do .
In my talk today , I &apos;ve told you a little bit about mind-wandering , a variable that I think turns out to be fairly important in the equation for happiness .
My hope is that over time , by tracking people &apos;s moment-to-moment happiness and their experiences in daily life , we &apos;ll be able to uncover a lot of important causes of happiness , and then in the end , a scientific understanding of happiness will help us create a future that &apos;s not only richer and healthier , but happier as well .
Thank you .
Eli Beer : The fastest ambulance ? A motorcycle
As a young EMT on a Jerusalem ambulance , Eli Beer realized that , stuck in brutal urban traffic , they often arrived too late to help . So he organized a group of volunteer EMTs -- many on foot -- ready to drop everything and dash to save lives in their neighborhood . Today , United Hatzlah uses a smartphone app and a fleet of &quot; ambucycles &quot; to help nearby patients until an ambulance arrives . With an average response time of 3 minutes , last year , they treated 207,000 people in Israel . And the idea is going global .
This is an ambucycle .
This is the fastest way to reach any medical emergency .
It has everything an ambulance has except for a bed .
You see the defibrillator . You see the equipment .
We all saw the tragedy that happened in Boston .
When I was looking at these pictures , it brought me back many years to my past when I was a child .
I grew up in a small neighborhood in Jerusalem .
When I was six years old , I was walking back from school on a Friday afternoon with my older brother .
We were passing by a bus stop .
We saw a bus blow up in front of our eyes .
The bus was on fire , and many people were hurt and killed .
I remembered an old man yelling to us and crying to help us get him up .
He just needed someone helping him .
We were so scared and we just ran away .
Growing up , I decided I wanted to become a doctor and save lives .
Maybe that was because of what I saw when I was a child .
When I was 15 , I took an EMT course , and I went to volunteer on an ambulance .
For two years , I volunteered on an ambulance in Jerusalem .
I helped many people , but whenever someone really needed help , I never got there in time . We never got there .
The traffic is so bad . The distance , and everything .
We never got there when somebody really needed us .
One day , we received a call about a seven-year-old child choking from a hot dog .
Traffic was horrific , and we were coming from the other side of town in the north part of Jerusalem .
When we got there , 20 minutes later , we started CPR on the kid .
A doctor comes in from a block away , stop us , checks the kid , and tells us to stop CPR .
That second he declared this child dead .
At that moment , I understood that this child died for nothing .
If this doctor , who lived one block away from there , would have come 20 minutes earlier , not have to wait until that siren he heard before coming from the ambulance , if he would have heard about it way before , he would have saved this child .
He could have run from a block away .
He could have saved this child .
I said to myself , there must be a better way .
Together with 15 of my friends -- we were all EMTs ‚Äî we decided , let &apos;s protect our neighborhood , so when something like that happens again , we will be there running to the scene a lot before the ambulance .
So I went over to the manager of the ambulance company and I told him , &quot; Please , whenever you have a call coming into our neighborhood , we have 15 great guys who are willing to stop everything they &apos;re doing and run and save lives .
Just alert us by beeper .
We &apos;ll buy these beepers , just tell your dispatch to send us the beeper , and we will run and save lives . &quot;
Well , he was laughing . I was 17 years old . I was a kid .
And he said to me ‚Äî I remember this like yesterday ‚Äî he was a great guy , but he said to me , &quot; Kid , go to school , or go open a falafel stand .
We &apos;re not really interested in these kinds of new adventures .
We &apos;re not interested in your help . &quot; And he threw me out of the room .
&quot; I don &apos;t need your help , &quot; he said .
I was a very stubborn kid .
As you see now , I &apos;m walking around like crazy , meshugenah .
So I decided to use the Israeli very famous technique you &apos;ve probably all heard of , chutzpah .
And the next day , I went and I bought two police scanners , and I said , &quot; The hell with you , if you don &apos;t want to give me information , I &apos;ll get the information myself . &quot;
And we did turns , who &apos;s going to listen to the radio scanners .
The next day , while I was listening to the scanners , I heard about a call coming in of a 70-year-old man hurt by a car only one block away from me on the main street of my neighborhood .
I ran there by foot . I had no medical equipment .
When I got there , the 70-year-old man was lying on the floor , blood was gushing out of his neck .
He was on Coumadin .
I knew I had to stop his bleeding or else he would die .
I took off my yarmulke , because I had no medical equipment , and with a lot of pressure , I stopped his bleeding .
He was bleeding from his neck .
When the ambulance arrived 15 minutes later , I gave them over a patient who was alive .
When I went to visit him two days later , he gave me a hug and was crying and thanking me for saving his life .
At that moment , when I realized this is the first person I ever saved in my life after two years volunteering in an ambulance , I knew this is my life &apos;s mission .
So today , 22 years later , we have United Hatzalah .
&quot; Hatzalah &quot; means &quot; rescue , &quot; for all of you who don &apos;t know Hebrew .
I forgot I &apos;m not in Israel .
So we have thousands of volunteers who are passionate about saving lives , and they &apos;re spread all around , so whenever a call comes in , they just stop everything and go and run and save a life .
Our average response time today went down to less than three minutes in Israel .
I &apos;m talking about heart attacks , I &apos;m talking about car accidents , God forbid bomb attacks , shootings , whatever it is , even a woman 3 o &apos;clock in the morning falling in her home and needs someone to help her .
Three minutes , we &apos;ll have a guy with his pajamas running to her house and helping her get up .
The reasons why we &apos;re so successful are because of three things .
Thousands of passionate volunteers who will leave everything they do and run to help people they don &apos;t even know .
We &apos;re not there to replace ambulances .
We &apos;re just there to get the gap between the ambulance call until they arrive .
And we save people that otherwise would not be saved .
The second reason is because of our technology .
You know , Israelis are good in technology .
Every one of us has on his phone , no matter what kind of phone , a GPS technology done by NowForce , and whenever a call comes in , the closest five volunteers get the call , and they actually get there really quick , and navigated by a traffic navigator to get there and not waste time .
And this is a great technology we use all over the country and reduce the response time .
And the third thing are these ambucycles .
These ambucycles are an ambulance on two wheels .
We don &apos;t transfer people , but we stabilize them , and we save their lives .
They never get stuck in traffic . They could even go on a sidewalk .
They never , literally , get stuck in traffic .
That &apos;s why we get there so fast .
A few years after I started this organization , in a Jewish community , two Muslims from east Jerusalem called me up .
They ask me to meet . They wanted to meet with me .
Muhammad Asli and Murad Alyan .
When Muhammad told me his personal story , how his father , 55 years old , collapsed at home , had a cardiac arrest , and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive , and he saw his father die in front of his eyes , he asked me , &quot; Please start this in east Jerusalem . &quot;
I said to myself , I saw so much tragedy , so much hate , and it &apos;s not about saving Jews . It &apos;s not about saving Muslims .
It &apos;s not about saving Christians . It &apos;s about saving people .
So I went ahead , full force -- ‚Äî and I started United Hatzalah in east Jerusalem , and that &apos;s why the names United and Hatzalah match so well .
We started hand in hand saving Jews and Arabs .
Arabs were saving Jews . Jews were saving Arabs .
Something special happened .
Arabs and Jews , they don &apos;t always get along together , but here in this situation , the communities , literally , it &apos;s an unbelievable situation that happened , the diversities , all of a sudden they had a common interest : Let &apos;s save lives together .
Settlers were saving Arabs and Arabs were saving settlers .
It &apos;s an unbelievable concept that could work only when you have such a great cause .
And these are all volunteers .
No one is getting money .
They &apos;re all doing it for the purpose of saving lives .
When my own father collapsed a few years ago from a cardiac arrest , one of the first volunteers to arrive to save my father was one of these Muslim volunteers from east Jerusalem who was in the first course to join Hatzalah .
And he saved my father .
Could you imagine how I felt in that moment ?
When I started this organization , I was 17 years old .
I never imagined that one day I &apos;d be speaking at TEDMED .
I never even knew what TEDMED was then .
I don &apos;t think it existed , but I never imagined , I never imagined that it &apos;s going to go all around , it &apos;s going to spread around , and this last year we started in Panama and Brazil .
All I need is a partner who is a little meshugenah like me , passionate about saving lives , and willing to do it .
And I &apos;m actually starting it in India very soon with a friend who I met in Harvard just a while back .
Hatzalah actually started in Brooklyn by a Hasidic Jew years before us in Williamsburg , and now it &apos;s all over the Jewish community in New York , even Australia and Mexico and many other Jewish communities .
But it could spread everywhere .
It &apos;s very easy to adopt .
You even saw these volunteers in New York saving lives in the World Trade Center .
Last year alone , we treated in Israel 207,000 people .
Forty-two thousand of them were life-threatening situations .
And we made a difference .
I guess you could call this a lifesaving flash mob , and it works .
When I look all around here , I see lots of people who would go an extra mile , run an extra mile to save other people , no matter who they are , no matter what religion , no matter who , where they come from .
We all want to be heroes .
We just need a good idea , motivation and lots of chutzpah , and we could save millions of people that otherwise would not be saved .
Thank you very much .
Joshua Silver : Adjustable liquid-filled eyeglasses
Josh Silver delivers his brilliantly simple solution for correcting vision at the lowest cost possible -- adjustable , liquid-filled lenses . At TEDGlobal 2009 , he demos his affordable eyeglasses and reveals his global plan to distribute them to a billion people in need by 2020 .
I &apos;m going to tell you about one of the world &apos;s largest problems and how it can be solved .
I &apos;d like to start with a little experiment .
Could you put your hand up if you wear glasses or contact lenses , or you &apos;ve had laser refractive surgery ?
Now , unfortunately , there are too many of you for me to do the statistics properly .
But it looks like -- I &apos;m guessing -- that it &apos;ll be about 60 percent of the room because that &apos;s roughly the fraction of developed world population that have some sort of vision correction .
The World Health Organization estimates -- well , they make various estimates of the number of people who need glasses -- the lowest estimate is 150 million people .
They also have an estimate of around a billion .
But in fact , I would argue that we &apos;ve just done an experiment here and now , which shows us that the global need for corrective eyewear is around half of any population .
And the problem of poor vision , is actually not just a health problem , it &apos;s also an educational problem , and it &apos;s an economic problem , and it &apos;s a quality of life problem .
Glasses are not very expensive . They &apos;re quite plentiful .
The problem is , there aren &apos;t enough eye care professionals in the world to use the model of the delivery of corrective eyewear that we have in the developed world .
There are just way too few eye care professionals .
So this little slide here shows you an optometrist and the little blue person represents about 10,000 people and that &apos;s the ratio in the U.K.
This is the ratio of optometrists to people in sub-Saharan Africa .
In fact , there are some countries in sub-Saharan Africa where there &apos;s one optometrist for eight million of the population .
How do you do this ? How do you solve this problem ?
I came up with a solution to this problem , and I came up with a solution based on adaptive optics for this .
And the idea is you make eye glasses , and you adjust them yourself and that solves the problem .
What I want to do is to show you that one can make a pair of glasses .
I shall just show you how you make a pair of glasses . I shall pop this in my pocket .
I &apos;m short sighted . I look at the signs at the end , I can hardly see them .
So -- okay , I can now see that man running out there , I &apos;ve now made prescription eyewear to my prescription .
Next step in my process .
So , I &apos;ve now made eye glasses to my prescription .
Okay , so I &apos;ve made these glasses and ...
Okay , I &apos;ve made the glasses to my prescription and ...
... I &apos;ve just ...
And I &apos;ve now made some glasses . That &apos;s it .
Now , these aren &apos;t the only pair in the world .
In fact , this technology &apos;s been evolving .
I started working on it in 1985 , and it &apos;s been evolving very slowly .
There are about 30,000 in use now .
And they &apos;re in fifteen countries . They &apos;re spread around the world .
And I have a vision , which I &apos;ll share with you .
I have a global vision for vision .
And that vision is to try to get a billion people wearing the glasses they need by the year 2020 .
To do that -- this is an early example of the technology .
The technology is being further developed -- the cost has to be brought down .
This pair , in fact , these currently cost about 19 dollars .
But the cost has to be brought right down .
It has to be brought down because we &apos;re trying to serve populations who live on a dollar a day .
How do you solve this problem ?
You start to get into detail .
And on this slide , I &apos;m basically explaining all the problems you have .
How do you distribute ? How do you work out how to fit the thing ?
How do you have people realizing that they have a vision problem ?
How do you deal with the industry ?
And the answer to that is research .
What we &apos;ve done is to set up the Center for Vision in the Developing World here in the university .
If you want to know more , just come have a look at our website . Thank you .
Julia Bacha : Pay attention to nonviolence
In 2003 , the Palestinian village of Budrus mounted a 10-month-long nonviolent protest to stop a barrier being built across their olive groves . Did you hear about it ? Didn &apos;t think so . Brazilian filmmaker Julia Bacha asks why we only pay attention to violence in the Israel-Palestine conflict -- and not to the nonviolent leaders who may one day bring peace .
I &apos;m a filmmaker .
For the last 8 years , I have dedicated my life to documenting the work of Israelis and Palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means .
When I travel with my work across Europe and the United States , one question always comes up : Where is the Palestinian Gandhi ?
Why aren &apos;t Palestinians using nonviolent resistance ?
The challenge I face when I hear this question is that often I have just returned from the Middle East where I spent my time filming dozens of Palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from Israeli soldiers and settlers .
These leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region .
Yet , most of you have probably never heard about them .
This divide between what &apos;s happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we don &apos;t have yet a Palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful .
So I &apos;m here today to talk about the power of attention , the power of your attention , and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the West Bank , Gaza and elsewhere -- but today , my case study is going to be Palestine .
I believe that what &apos;s mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for Palestinians to start adopting nonviolence , but for us to start paying attention to those who already are .
Allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called Budrus .
About seven years ago , they faced extinction , because Israel announced it would build a separation barrier , and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village .
They would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded , so they would lose free access to the rest of the West Bank .
Through inspired local leadership , they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening .
Let me show you some brief clips , so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground .
Palestinian We were told the wall would separate Palestine from Israel .
Here in Budrus , we realized the wall would steal our land .
Israeli The fence has , in fact , created a solution to terror .
Today you &apos;re invited to a peaceful march .
You are joined by dozens of your Israeli brothers and sisters .
Israeli Activist : Nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition .
We saw the men trying to push the soldiers , but none of them could do that .
But I think the girls could do it .
Fatah Party Member : We must empty our minds of traditional thinking .
Hamas Party Member : We were in complete harmony , and we wanted to spread it to all of Palestine .
Chanting : One united nation .
Fatah , Hamas and the Popular Front !
News Anchor : The clashes over the fence continue .
Reporter : Israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd .
They were allowed to use any force necessary .
These are live bullets .
It &apos;s like Fallujah . Shooting everywhere .
Israeli Activist : I was sure we were all going to die .
But there were others around me who weren &apos;t even cowering .
Israeli A nonviolent protest is not going to stop the &#91; unclear &#93; .
Protester : This is a peaceful march .
There is no need to use violence .
Chanting : We can do it ! We can do it !
We can do it !
Julia Bacha : When I first heard about the story of Budrus , I was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago , in 2003 .
What was even more surprising was the fact that Budrus was successful .
The residents , after 10 months of peaceful resistance , convinced the Israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line , which is the internationally recognized boundary between Israel and the Palestinian Territories .
The resistance in Budrus has since spread to villages across the West Bank and to Palestinian neighborhoods in Jerusalem .
Yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories .
This silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow , or even survive , in Palestine .
Violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause .
If violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the Palestinian issue , it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight .
The power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room .
The surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit .
The tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior , since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it .
Parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children .
But that &apos;s true for adults too .
In fact , the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced , depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention .
I believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the Middle East and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today .
In the course of taking my film to villages in the West Bank , in Gaza and in East Jerusalem , I have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation .
In a village called Wallajeh , which sits very close to Jerusalem , the community was facing a very similar plight to Budrus .
They were going to be surrounded , lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access , either to the West Bank or Jerusalem .
They had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention .
So we organized a screening .
A week later , they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date .
The organizers say that the villagers , upon seeing the story of Budrus documented in a film , felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing , that people cared .
So they kept on going .
On the Israeli side , there is a new peace movement called Solidariot , which means solidarity in Hebrew .
The leaders of this movement have been using Budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools .
They report that Israelis who had never been active before , upon seeing the film , understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities .
The examples of Wallajeh and the Solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior .
Now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like Bil &apos;in , Ni &apos;lin , Wallajeh , in Jerusalem neighborhoods like Sheikh Jarrah and Silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible , valued and effective in their work .
I believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we don &apos;t pay attention to these efforts , they are invisible , and it &apos;s as if they never happened .
But I have seen first hand that if we do , they will multiply .
If they multiply , their influence will grow in the overall Israeli-Palestinian conflict .
And theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation .
These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus .
Let &apos;s give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere .
Thank you .
Seth Godin : How to get your ideas to spread
In a world of too many options and too little time , our obvious choice is to just ignore the ordinary stuff . Marketing guru Seth Godin spells out why , when it comes to getting our attention , bad or bizarre ideas are more successful than boring ones .
I &apos;m going to give you four specific examples -- and I &apos;m going to cover at the end -- about how a company called Silk tripled their sales by doing one thing , how an artist named Jeff Koons went from being a nobody to making a whole bunch of money and having a lot of impact , to how Frank Gehry redefined what it meant to be an architect .
And one of my biggest failures as a marketer in the last few years , a record label I started that had a CD called &quot; Sauce . &quot;
Before I can do that I &apos;ve got to tell you about sliced bread , and a guy named Otto Rohwedder .
Now , before sliced bread was invented in the 1910s I wonder what they said ?
Like the greatest invention since ... the telegraph or something .
But this guy named Otto Rohwedder invented sliced bread , and he focused , like most inventors did , on the patent part and the making part .
And the thing about the invention of sliced bread is this -- that for the first 15 years after sliced bread was available no one bought it ; no one knew about it ; it was a complete and total failure .
And the reason is that until Wonder came along and figured out how to spread the idea of sliced bread , no one wanted it .
That the success of sliced bread , like the success of almost everything we &apos;ve been talking about at this conference , is not always about what the patent is like , or what the factory is like -- it &apos;s about can you get your idea to spread , or not .
And I think that the way you &apos;re going to get what you want , or cause the change that you want to change , to happen , is that you &apos;ve got to figure out a way to get your ideas to spread .
And it doesn &apos;t matter to me whether you &apos;re running a coffee shop or you &apos;re an intellectual , or you &apos;re in business , or you &apos;re flying hot air balloons .
I think that all this stuff applies to everybody regardless of what we do .
That what we are living in is a century of idea diffusion .
That people who can spread ideas , regardless of what those ideas are , win .
And when I talk about it I usually pick business because they make the best pictures that you can put in your presentation , and because it &apos;s the easiest sort of way to keep score .
But I want you to forgive me when I use these examples because I &apos;m talking about anything that you decide to spend your time to do .
At the heart of spreading ideas is TV and stuff like TV .
TV and mass media made it really easy to spread ideas in a certain way .
I call it the &quot; TV-industrial complex . &quot;
The way the TV-industrial complex works , is you buy some ads -- interrupt some people -- that gets you distribution .
You use the distribution you get to sell more products .
You take the profit from that to buy more ads .
And it goes around and around and around , the same way that military-industrial complex worked a long time ago .
And that model of , and we heard it yesterday , if we could only get onto the homepage of Google , if we could only figure out how to get promoted there , if we could only figure out how to grab that person by the throat , and tell them about what we want to do .
If we do that then everyone would pay attention , and we would win .
Well , this TV-industrial complex informed my entire childhood and probably yours .
I mean , all of these products succeeded because someone figured out how to touch people in a way they weren &apos;t expecting , in a way they didn &apos;t necessarily want , with an ad , over and over and over again until they bought it .
And the thing that &apos;s happened is , they canceled the TV-industrial complex .
That just over the last few years , what anybody who markets anything has discovered is that it &apos;s not working the way that it used to .
This picture is really fuzzy , I apologize ; I had a bad cold when I took it .
But the product in the blue box in the center is my poster child .
Right . I go to the deli ; I &apos;m sick ; I need to buy some medicine .
The brand manager for that blue product spent 100 million dollars trying to interrupt me in one year .
100 million dollars interrupting me with TV commercials and magazine ads and spam and coupons and shelving allowances and spiff -- all so I could ignore every single message .
And I ignored every message because I don &apos;t have a pain reliever problem .
I buy the stuff in the yellow box because I always have .
And I &apos;m not going to invest a minute of my time to solve her problem , because I don &apos;t care .
Here &apos;s a magazine called &quot; Hydrate . &quot; It &apos;s 180 pages about water .
Right . Articles about water , ads about water .
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek .
Now there are magazines about water .
New products from Coke Japan -- water salad .
OK . Coke Japan comes out with a new product every three weeks , because they have no idea what &apos;s going to work and what &apos;s not .
I couldn &apos;t have written this better myself . It came out four days ago -- I circled the important parts so you can see them here .
They &apos;ve come out ... Arby &apos;s is going to spend 85 million dollars promoting an oven mitt with the voice of Tom Arnold , hoping that that will get people to go to Arby &apos;s and buy a roast beef sandwich .
Now , I had tried to imagine what could possibly be in an animated TV commercial featuring Tom Arnold , that would get you to get in your car , drive across town and buy a roast beef sandwich .
Now , this is Copernicus , and he was right , when he was talking to anyone who needs to hear your idea .
The world revolves around me . Me , me , me , me , me . My favorite person -- me .
I don &apos;t want to get email from anybody ; I want to get &quot; memail . &quot;
So consumers , and I don &apos;t just mean people who buy stuff at the Safeway ; I mean people at the Defense Department who might buy something , or people at , you know , the New Yorker who might print your article .
Consumers don &apos;t care about you at all ; they just don &apos;t care .
Part of the reason is -- they &apos;ve got way more choices than they used to , and way less time .
And in a world where we have too many choices and too little time , the obvious thing to do is just ignore stuff .
And my parable here is you &apos;re driving down the road and you see a cow , and you keep driving because you &apos;ve seen cows before .
Cows are invisible . Cows are boring .
Who &apos;s going to stop and pull over and say -- oh , look , a cow . Nobody .
But if the cow was purple -- isn &apos;t that a great special effect ?
I could do that again if you want it .
If the cow was purple , you &apos;d notice it for a while .
I mean , if all cows were purple you &apos;d get bored with those , too .
The thing that &apos;s going to decide what gets talked about , what gets done , what gets changed , what gets purchased , what gets built , is : is it remarkable ?
And &quot; remarkable &quot; is a really cool word because we think it just means neat , but it also means -- worth making a remark about .
And that is the essence of where idea diffusion is going .
That two of the hottest cars in the United States is a 55,000-dollar giant car , big enough to hold a mini in its trunk .
People are paying full price for both , and the only thing they have in common is that they don &apos;t have anything in common .
Every week the number one best-selling DVD in America changes .
It &apos;s never &quot; The Godfather ; &quot; it &apos;s never &quot; Citizen Kane ; &quot; it &apos;s always some third rate movie with some second rate star .
But the reason it &apos;s number one is because that &apos;s the week it came out .
Because it &apos;s new , because it &apos;s fresh .
Because people saw it and said -- I didn &apos;t know that was there -- and they noticed it .
Two of the big success stories of the last 20 years in retail -- one sells things that are super-expensive in a blue box , and one sells things that are as cheap as they can make them .
The only thing they have in common is that they &apos;re different .
We &apos;re now in the fashion business , no matter what we do for a living , we &apos;re in the fashion business .
And the thing is , people in the fashion business know what it &apos;s like to be in the fashion business -- they &apos;re used to it .
The rest of us have to figure out how to think that way .
How to understand that it &apos;s not about interrupting people with big full-page ads , or insisting on meetings with people .
But it &apos;s a totally different sort of process that determines which ideas spread , and which ones don &apos;t .
This chair -- they sold a billion dollars &apos; worth of Aeron chairs by reinventing what it meant to sell a chair .
They turned a chair from something the purchasing department bought , to something that was a status symbol about where you sat at work .
This guy , Lionel Poilane , the most famous baker in the world -- he died two and a half months ago , and he was a hero of mine and a dear friend .
He lived in Paris . Last year he sold 10 million dollars &apos; worth of French bread .
Every loaf baked in a bakery he owned , by one baker at a time , in a wood-fired oven .
And when Lionel started his bakery the French pooh-pooh-ed it .
They didn &apos;t want to buy his bread . It didn &apos;t look like &quot; French bread . &quot;
It wasn &apos;t what they expected .
It was neat ; it was remarkable ; and slowly it spread from one person to another person until finally , it became the official bread of three-star restaurants in Paris .
Now he &apos;s in London , and he ships by FedEx all around the world .
What marketers used to do is make average products for average people .
That &apos;s what mass marketing is .
Smooth out the edges ; go for the center ; that &apos;s the big market .
They would ignore the geeks , and God forbid , the laggards .
It was all about going for the center .
But in a world where the TV-industrial complex is broken , I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a strategy we want to use any more .
I think the strategy we want to use is to not market to these people because they &apos;re really good at ignoring you .
But market to these people because they care .
These are the people who are obsessed with something .
And when you talk to them they &apos;ll listen because they like listening -- it &apos;s about them .
And if you &apos;re lucky , they &apos;ll tell their friends on the rest of the curve , and it &apos;ll spread .
It &apos;ll spread to the entire curve .
They have something I call &quot; otaku &quot; -- it &apos;s a great Japanese word .
It describes the desire of someone who &apos;s obsessed to say , drive across Tokyo to try a new ramen noodle place , because that &apos;s what they do : they get obsessed with it .
To make a product , to market an idea , to come up with any problem you want to solve that doesn &apos;t have a constituency with an otaku , is almost impossible .
Instead , you have to find a group that really , desperately cares about what it is you have to say .
Talk to them and make it easy for them to tell their friends .
There &apos;s a hot sauce otaku , but there &apos;s no mustard otaku .
That &apos;s why there &apos;s lots and lots and lots of kinds of hot sauces , and not so many kinds of mustard .
Not because it &apos;s hard to make interesting mustard -- you can make interesting mustard -- but people don &apos;t because no one &apos;s obsessed with it , and thus no one tells their friends .
Krispy Kreme has figured this whole thing out .
Krispy Kreme has a strategy , and what they do is , they enter a city , they talk to the people with otaku , and then they spread through the city to the people who &apos;ve just crossed the street .
This yoyo right here cost 112 dollars , but it sleeps for 12 minutes .
Not everybody wants it but they don &apos;t care .
They want to talk to the people who do , and maybe it &apos;ll spread .
These guys make the loudest car stereo in the world .
It &apos;s as loud as a 747 jet . You can &apos;t get in the car ; it &apos;s got bulletproof glass on the windows because they &apos;ll blow out the windshield otherwise .
But the fact remains that when someone wants to put a couple of speakers in their car , if they &apos;ve got the otaku or they &apos;ve heard from someone who does , they go ahead and they pick this .
It &apos;s really simple -- you sell to the people who are listening , and maybe , just maybe those people tell their friends .
So when Steve Jobs talks to 50,000 people at his keynote , right , who are all tuned in from 130 countries watching his two-hour commercial -- that &apos;s the only thing keeping his company in business -- is that those 50,000 people care desperately enough to watch a two-hour commercial , and then tell their friends .
Pearl Jam , 96 albums released in the last two years .
Every one made a profit . How ?
They only sell them on their website .
Those people who buy them on the website have the otaku , and then they tell their friends , and it spreads and it spreads .
This hospital crib cost 10,000 dollars , 10 times the standard .
But hospitals are buying it faster than any other model .
Hard Candy nail polish , doesn &apos;t appeal to everybody , but to the people who love it , they talk about it like crazy .
This paint can right here saved the Dutch Boy paint company , making them a fortune . It costs 35 percent more than regular paint because Dutch Boy made a can that people talk about , because it &apos;s remarkable .
They didn &apos;t just slap a new ad on the product ; they changed what it meant to build a paint product .
AmIhotornot.com -- everyday 250,000 people go to this site , run by two volunteers , and I can tell you they are hard graders , and they didn &apos;t get this way by advertising a lot .
They got this way by being remarkable , sometimes a little too remarkable .
And this picture frame has a cord going out the back , and you plug it into the wall .
My father has this on his desk , and he sees his grandchildren everyday , changing constantly .
And every single person who walks into his office hears the whole story of how this thing ended up on his desk .
And one person at a time , the idea spreads .
These are not diamonds , not really .
They &apos;re made from &quot; cremains . &quot;
After you &apos;re cremated you can have yourself made into a gem .
Oh , you like my ring ? It &apos;s my grandmother .
Fastest-growing business in the whole mortuary industry .
But you don &apos;t have to be Ozzie Osborne -- you don &apos;t have to be super-outrageous to do this .
What you have to do is figure out what people really want and give it to them .
A couple of quick rules to wrap up .
The first one is : Design is free when you get to scale .
And the people who come up with stuff that &apos;s remarkable more often than not figure out how to put design to work for them .
Number two : The riskiest thing you can do now is be safe .
Proctor and Gamble knows this , right ?
The whole model of being Proctor and Gamble is always about average products for average people .
That &apos;s risky . The safe thing to do now is to be at the fringes , be remarkable .
And being very good is one of the worst things you can possibly do .
Very good is boring . Very good is average .
It doesn &apos;t matter whether you &apos;re making a record album , or you &apos;re an architect , or you have a tract on sociology .
If it &apos;s very good , it &apos;s not going to work , because no one &apos;s going to notice it .
So my three stories .
Silk . Put a product that does not need to be in the refrigerated section next to the milk in the refrigerated section .
Sales tripled . Why ?
Milk , milk , milk , milk , milk -- not milk .
For the people who were there and looking at that section , it was remarkable .
They didn &apos;t triple their sales with advertising ; they tripled it by doing something remarkable .
That is a remarkable piece of art . You don &apos;t have to like it , but a 40-foot tall dog made out of bushes in the middle of New York City is remarkable .
Frank Gehry didn &apos;t just change a museum ; he changed an entire city &apos;s economy by designing one building that people from all over the world went to see .
Now , at countless meetings at , you know , the Portland City Council , or who knows where , they said , we need an architect -- can we get Frank Gehry ?
Because he did something that was at the fringes .
And my big failure ? I came out with an entire record album and hopefully a whole bunch of record albums in SACD format -- this remarkable new format -- and I marketed it straight to people with 20,000-dollar stereos .
People with 20,000-dollar stereos don &apos;t like new music .
So what you need to do is figure out who does care .
Who is going to raise their hand and say , &quot; I want to hear what you &apos;re doing next , &quot; and sell something to them .
The last example I want to give you .
This is a map of Soap Lake , Washington .
As you can see , if that &apos;s nowhere , it &apos;s in the middle of it .
But they do have a lake .
And people used to come from miles around to swim in the lake .
They don &apos;t anymore . So the founding fathers said , &quot; We &apos;ve got some money to spend .
What can we build here ? &quot; And like most committees , they were going to build something pretty safe .
And then an artist came to them -- this is a true artist &apos;s rendering -- he wants to build a 55-foot tall lava lamp in the center of town .
That &apos;s a purple cow ; that &apos;s something worth noticing .
I don &apos;t know about you but if they build it , that &apos;s where I &apos;m going to go .
Thank you very much for your attention .
Rob Hopkins : Transition to a world without oil
Rob Hopkins reminds us that the oil our world depends on is steadily running out . He proposes a unique solution to this problem -- the Transition response , where we prepare ourselves for life without oil and sacrifice our luxuries to build systems and communities that are completely independent of fossil fuels .
As a culture , we tell ourselves lots of stories about the future , and where we might move forward from this point .
Some of those stories are that somebody is just going to sort everything out for us .
Other stories are that everything is on the verge of unraveling .
But I want to tell you a different story here today .
Like all stories , it has a beginning .
My work , for a long time , has been involved in education , in teaching people practical skills for sustainability , teaching people how to take responsibility for growing some of their own food , how to build buildings using local materials , how to generate their own energy , and so on .
I lived in Ireland , built the first straw-bale houses in Ireland , and some cob buildings and all this kind of thing .
But all my work for many years was focused around the idea that sustainability means basically looking at the globalized economic growth model , and moderating what comes in at one end , And then I came into contact with a way of looking at things which actually changed that profoundly .
And in order to introduce you to that , I &apos;ve got something here that I &apos;m going to unveil , which is one of the great marvels of the modern age .
And it &apos;s something so astounding and so astonishing that I think maybe as I remove this cloth a suitable gasp of amazement might be appropriate .
If you could help me with that it would be fantastic .
This is a liter of oil .
This bottle of oil , distilled over a hundred million years of geological time , ancient sunlight , contains the energy equivalent of about five weeks hard human manual labor -- equivalent to about 35 strong people coming round and working for you .
We can turn it into a dazzling array of materials , medicine , modern clothing , laptops , a whole range of different things .
It gives us an energy return that &apos;s unimaginable , historically .
We &apos;ve based the design of our settlements , our business models , our transport plans , even the idea of economic growth , some would argue , on the assumption that we will have this in perpetuity .
Yet , when we take a step back , and look over the span of history , at what we might call the petroleum interval , it &apos;s a short period in history where we &apos;ve discovered this extraordinary material , and then based a whole way of life around it .
But as we straddle the top of this energy mountain , at this stage , we move from a time where our economic success , our sense of individual prowess and well-being is directly linked to how much of this we consume , to a time when actually our degree of oil dependency is our degree of vulnerability .
And it &apos;s increasingly clear that we aren &apos;t going to be able to rely on the fact that we &apos;re going to have this at our disposal forever .
For every four barrels of oil that we consume , we only discover one .
And that gap continues to widen .
There is also the fact that the amount of energy that we get back from the oil that we discover is falling .
In the 1930s we got 100 units of energy back for every one that we put in to extract it .
Completely unprecedented , historically .
Already that &apos;s fallen to about 11 .
And that &apos;s why , now , the new breakthroughs , the new frontiers in terms of oil extraction are scrambling about in Alberta , or at the bottom of the oceans .
There are 98 oil-producing nations in the world .
But of those , 65 have already passed their peak .
The moment when the world on average passes this peak , people wonder when that &apos;s going to happen .
And there is an emerging case that maybe that was what happened last July when the oil prices were so high .
But are we to assume that the same brilliance and creativity and adaptability that got us up to the top of that energy mountain in the first place is somehow mysteriously going to evaporate when we have to design a creative way back down the other side ?
No . But the thinking that we have to come up with has to be based on a realistic assessment of where we are .
There is also the issue of climate change , is the other thing that underpins this transition approach .
But the thing that I notice , as I talk to climate scientists , is the increasingly terrified look they have in their eyes , as the data that &apos;s coming in , which is far ahead of what the IPCC are talking about .
So the IPCC said that we might see significant breakup of the arctic ice in 2100 , in their worst case scenario .
Actually , if current trends continue , it could all be gone in five or 10 years &apos; time .
If just three percent of the carbon locked up in the arctic permafrost is released as the world warms , it would offset all the savings that we need to make , in carbon , over the next 40 years to avoid runaway climate change .
We have no choice other than deep and urgent decarbonization .
But I &apos;m always very interested to think about what might the stories be that the generations further down the slope from us are going to tell about us .
&quot; The generation that lived at the top of the mountain , that partied so hard , and so abused its inheritance . &quot;
And one of the ways I like to do that is to look back at the stories people used to tell before we had cheap oil , before we had fossil fuels , and people relied on their own muscle , animal muscle energy , or a little bit of wind , little bit of water energy .
We had stories like &quot; The Seven-League Boots &quot; : the giant who had these boots , where , once you put them on , with every stride you could cover seven leagues , or 21 miles , a kind of travel completely unimaginable to people without that kind of energy at their disposal .
Stories like The Magic Porridge Pot , where you had a pot where if you knew the magic words , this pot would just make as much food as you liked , without you having to do any work , provided you could remember the other magic word to stop it making porridge .
Otherwise you &apos;d flood your entire town with warm porridge .
There is the story of &quot; The Elves and the Shoemaker . &quot;
The people who make shoes go to sleep , wake up in the morning , and all the shoes are magically made for them .
It &apos;s something that was unimaginable to people then .
Now we have the seven-league boots in the form of Ryanair and Easyjet .
We have the magic porridge pot in the form of Walmart and Tesco .
And we have the elves in the form of China .
But we don &apos;t appreciate what an astonishing thing that has been .
And what are the stories that we tell ourselves now , as we look forward about where we &apos;re going to go .
And I would argue that there are four . There is the idea of business as usual , that the future will be like the present , just more of it .
But as we &apos;ve seen over the last year , I think that &apos;s an idea that is increasingly coming into question .
And in terms of climate change , is something that is not actually feasible .
There is the idea of hitting the wall , that actually somehow everything is so fragile that it might just all unravel and collapse .
This is a popular story in some places .
The third story is the idea that technology can solve everything , that technology can somehow get us through this completely .
And it &apos;s an idea that I think is very prevalent at these TED Talks , the idea that we can invent our way out of a profound economic and energy crisis , that a move to a knowledge economy can somehow neatly sidestep those energy constraints , the idea that we &apos;ll discover some fabulous new source of energy that will mean we can sweep all concerns about energy security to one side , the idea that we can step off neatly onto a completely renewable world .
But the world isn &apos;t Second Life .
We can &apos;t create new land and new energy systems at the click of a mouse .
And as we sit , exchanging free ideas with each other , there are still people mining coal in order to power the servers , extracting the minerals to make all of those things .
The breakfast that we eat as we sit down to check our email in the morning is still transported at great distances , usually at the expense of the local , more resilient food systems that would have supplied that in the past , which we &apos;ve so effectively devalued and dismantled .
We can be astonishingly inventive and creative .
But we also live in a world with very real constraints and demands .
Energy and technology are not the same thing .
What I &apos;m involved with is the transition response .
And this is really about looking the challenges of peak oil and climate change square in the face , and responding with a creativity and an adaptability and an imagination that we really need .
It &apos;s something which has spread incredibly fast .
And it is something which has several characteristics .
It &apos;s viral . It seems to spread under the radar very , very quickly .
It &apos;s open source . It &apos;s something which everybody who &apos;s involved with it develops and passes on as they work with it .
It &apos;s self-organizing . There is no great central organization that pushes this ; people just pick up an idea and they run with it , and they implement it where they are .
It &apos;s solutions-focused . It &apos;s very much looking at what people can do where they are , to respond to this .
It &apos;s sensitive to place and to scale .
Transitional is completely different .
Transition groups in Chile , transition groups in the U.S. , transition groups here , what they &apos;re doing looks very different in every place that you go to .
It learns very much from its mistakes .
And it feels historic . It tries to create a sense that this is a historic opportunity to do something really extraordinary .
And it &apos;s a process which is really joyful .
People have a huge amount of fun doing this , reconnecting with other people as they do it .
One of the things that underpins it is this idea of resilience .
And I think , in many ways , the idea of resilience is a more useful concept than the idea of sustainability .
The idea of resilience comes from the study of ecology .
And it &apos;s really about how systems , settlements , withstand shock from the outside .
When they encounter shock from the outside that they don &apos;t just unravel and fall to pieces .
And I think it &apos;s a more useful concept than sustainability , as I said .
When our supermarkets have only two or three days &apos; worth of food in them at any one time , often sustainability tends to focus on the energy efficiency of the freezers and on the packaging that the lettuces are wrapped up in .
Looking through the lens of resilience , we really question how we &apos;ve let ourselves get into a situation that &apos;s so vulnerable .
Resilience runs much deeper : it &apos;s about building modularity into what we do , building surge breakers into how we organize the basic things that support us .
This is a photograph of the Bristol and District Market Gardeners Association , in 1897 .
This is at a time when the city of Bristol , which is quite close to here , was surrounded by commercial market gardens , which provided a significant amount of the food that was consumed in the town , and created a lot of employment for people , as well .
There was a degree of resilience , if you like , at that time , which we can now only look back on with envy .
So how does this transition idea work ?
So basically , you have a group of people who are excited by the idea .
They pick up some of the tools that we &apos;ve developed .
They start to run an awareness-raising program looking at how this might actually work in the town .
They show films , they give talks , and so on .
It &apos;s a process which is playful and creative and informative .
Then they start to form working groups , looking at different aspects of this , and then from that , there emerge a whole lot of projects which then the transition project itself starts to support and enable .
So it started out with some work I was involved in in Ireland , where I was teaching , and has since spread .
There are now over 200 formal transition projects .
And there are thousands of others who are at what we call the mulling stage .
They are mulling whether they &apos;re going to take it further .
And actually a lot of them are doing huge amounts of stuff .
But what do they actually do ? You know , it &apos;s a kind of nice idea , but what do they actually do on the ground ?
Well , I think it &apos;s really important to make the point that actually you know , this isn &apos;t something which is going to do everything on its own .
We need international legislation from Copenhagen and so on .
We need national responses . We need local government responses .
But all of those things are going to be much easier if we have communities that are vibrant and coming up with ideas and leading from the front , making unelectable policies electable , over the next 5 to 10 years .
Some of the things that emerge from it are local food projects , like community-supported agriculture schemes , urban food production , creating local food directories , and so on .
A lot of places now are starting to set up their own energy companies , community-owned energy companies , where the community can invest money into itself , to start putting in place the kind of renewable energy infrastructure that we need .
A lot of places are working with their local schools .
Newent in the Forest of Dean : big polytunnel they built for the school ; the kids are learning how to grow food .
Promoting recycling , things like garden-share , that matches up people who don &apos;t have a garden who would like to grow food , with people who have gardens they aren &apos;t using anymore .
Planting productive trees throughout urban spaces .
And also starting to play around with the idea of alternative currencies .
This is Lewes in Sussex , who have recently launched the Lewes Pound , a currency that you can only spend within the town , as a way of starting to cycle money within the local economy .
You take it anywhere else , it &apos;s not worth anything .
But actually within the town you start to create these economic cycles much more effectively .
Another thing that they do is what we call an energy descent plan , which is basically to develop a plan B for the town .
Most of our local authorities , when they sit down to plan for the next five , 10 , 15 , 20 years of a community , still start by assuming that there will be more energy , more cars , more housing , more jobs , more growth , and so on .
What does it look like if that &apos;s not the case ? And how can we embrace that and actually come up with something that was actually more likely to sustain everybody ?
As a friend of mine says , &quot; Life is a series of things you &apos;re not quite ready for . &quot;
And that &apos;s certainly been my experience with transition .
From three years ago , it just being an idea , this has become something that has virally swept around the world .
We &apos;re getting a lot of interest from government . Ed Miliband , the energy minister of this country , was invited to come to our recent conference as a keynote listener .
Which he did -- -- and has since become a great advocate of the whole idea .
There are now two local authorities in this country who have declared themselves transitional local authorities , Leicestershire and Somerset . And in Stroud , the transition group there , in effect , wrote the local government &apos;s food plan .
And the head of the council said , &quot; If we didn &apos;t have Transition Stroud , we would have to invent all of that community infrastructure for the first time . &quot;
As we see the spread of it , we see national hubs emerging .
In Scotland , the Scottish government &apos;s climate change fund has funded Transition Scotland as a national organization supporting the spread of this .
And we see it all over the place as well now .
But the key to transition is thinking not that we have to change everything now , but that things are already inevitably changing , and what we need to do is to work creatively with that , based on asking the right questions .
I think I &apos;d like to just return at the end to the idea of stories .
Because I think stories are vital here .
And actually the stories that we tell ourselves , we have a huge dearth of stories about how to move forward creatively from here .
And one of the key things that transition does is to pull those stories out of what people are doing .
Stories about the community that &apos;s produced its own 21 pound note , for example , the school that &apos;s turned its car park into a food garden , the community that &apos;s founded its own energy company .
And for me , one of the great stories recently was the Obamas digging up the south lawn of the White House to create a vegetable garden . Because the last time that was done , when Eleanor Roosevelt did it , it led to the creation of 20 million vegetable gardens across the United States .
So the question I &apos;d like to leave you with , really , is -- for all aspects of the things that your community needs in order to thrive , how can it be done in such a way that drastically reduces its carbon emissions , while also building resilience ?
Personally , I feel enormously grateful to have lived through the age of cheap oil .
I &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky , we &apos;ve been astonishingly lucky .
But let us honor what it has bought us , and move forward from this point .
Because if we cling to it , and continue to assume that it can underpin our choices , the future that it presents to us is one which is really unmanageable .
And by loving and leaving all that oil has done for us , and that the Oil Age has done for us , we are able to then begin the creation of a world which is more resilient , more nourishing , and in which , we find ourselves fitter , more skilled and more connected to each other .
Thank you very much .
Elizabeth Pisani : Sex , drugs and HIV -- let &apos;s get rational
Armed with bracing logic , wit and her &quot; public-health nerd &quot; glasses , Elizabeth Pisani reveals the myriad of inconsistencies in today &apos;s political systems that prevent our dollars from effectively fighting the spread of HIV . Her research with at-risk populations -- from junkies in prison to sex workers on the street in Cambodia -- demonstrates the sometimes counter-intuitive measures that could stall the spread of this devastating disease .
&quot; People do stupid things .
That &apos;s what spreads HIV . &quot;
This was a headline in a U.K. newspaper , The Guardian , not that long ago .
I &apos;m curious , show of hands , who agrees with it ?
Well , one or two brave souls .
This is actually a direct quote from an epidemiologist who &apos;s been in field of HIV for 15 years , worked on four continents , and you &apos;re looking at her .
And I am now going to argue that this is only half true .
People do get HIV because they do stupid things , but most of them are doing stupid things for perfectly rational reasons .
Now , &quot; rational &quot; is the dominant paradigm in public health , and if you put your public health nerd glasses on , you &apos;ll see that if we give people the information that they need about what &apos;s good for them and what &apos;s bad for them , if you give them the services that they can use to act on that information , and a little bit of motivation , people will make rational decisions and live long and healthy lives .
Wonderful .
That &apos;s slightly problematic for me because I work in HIV , and although I &apos;m sure you all know that HIV is about poverty and gender inequality , and if you were at TED &apos; 07 it &apos;s about coffee prices ...
Actually , HIV &apos;s about sex and drugs , and if there are two things that make human beings a little bit irrational , they are erections and addiction .
So , let &apos;s start with what &apos;s rational for an addict .
Now , I remember speaking to an Indonesian friend of mine , Frankie .
We were having lunch and he was telling me about when he was in jail in Bali for a drug injection .
It was someone &apos;s birthday , and they had very kindly smuggled some heroin into jail , and he was very generously sharing it out with all of his colleagues .
And so everyone lined up , all the smackheads in a row , and the guy whose birthday it was filled up the fit , and he went down and started injecting people .
So he injects the first guy , and then he &apos;s wiping the needle on his shirt , and he injects the next guy .
And Frankie says , &quot; I &apos;m number 22 in line , and I can see the needle coming down towards me , and there is blood all over the place .
It &apos;s getting blunter and blunter .
And a small part of my brain is thinking , &apos; That is so gross and really dangerous , &apos; but most of my brain is thinking , &apos; Please let there be some smack left by the time it gets to me .
Please let there be some left . &apos; &quot; And then , telling me this story , Frankie said , &quot; You know ... God , drugs really make you stupid . &quot;
And , you know , you can &apos;t fault him for accuracy .
But , actually , Frankie , at that time , was a heroin addict and he was in jail .
So his choice was either to accept that dirty needle or not to get high .
And if there &apos;s one place you really want to get high , it &apos;s when you &apos;re in jail .
But I &apos;m a scientist and I don &apos;t like to make data out of anecdotes , so let &apos;s look at some data .
We talked to 600 drug addicts in three cities in Indonesia , and we said , &quot; Well , do you know how you get HIV ? &quot;
&quot; Oh yeah , by sharing needles . &quot;
I mean , nearly 100 percent . Yeah , by sharing needles .
And , &quot; Do you know where you can get a clean needle at a price you can afford to avoid that ? &quot;
&quot; Oh yeah . &quot; Hundred percent .
&quot; We &apos;re smackheads ; we know where to get clean needles . &quot;
&quot; So are you carrying a needle ? &quot;
We &apos;re actually interviewing people on the street , in the places where they &apos;re hanging out and taking drugs .
&quot; Are you carrying clean needles ? &quot;
One in four , maximum .
So no surprises then that the proportion that actually used clean needles every time they injected in the last week is just about one in 10 , and the other nine in 10 are sharing .
So you &apos;ve got this massive mismatch ; everyone knows that if they share they &apos;re going to get HIV , but they &apos;re all sharing anyway .
So what &apos;s that about ? Is it like you get a better high if you share or something ?
We asked that to a junkie and they &apos;re like , &quot; Are you nuts ? &quot;
You don &apos;t want to share a needle anymore than you want to share a toothbrush even with someone you &apos;re sleeping with .
There &apos;s just kind of an ick factor there .
&quot; No , no . We share needles because we don &apos;t want to go to jail . &quot;
So , in Indonesia at this time , if you were carrying a needle and the cops rounded you up , they could put you into jail .
And that changes the equation slightly , doesn &apos;t it ?
Because your choice now is either I use my own needle now , or I could share a needle now and get a disease that &apos;s going to possibly kill me 10 years from now , or I could use my own needle now and go to jail tomorrow .
And while junkies think that it &apos;s a really bad idea to expose themselves to HIV , they think it &apos;s a much worse idea to spend the next year in jail where they &apos;ll probably end up in Frankie &apos;s situation and expose themselves to HIV anyway .
So , suddenly it becomes perfectly rational to share needles .
Now , let &apos;s look at it from a policy maker &apos;s point of view .
This is a really easy problem .
For once , your incentives are aligned .
We &apos;ve got what &apos;s rational for public health .
You want people to use clean needles -- and junkies want to use clean needles .
So we could make this problem go away simply by making clean needles universally available and taking away the fear of arrest .
Now , the first person to figure that out and do something about it on a national scale was that well-known , bleeding heart liberal Margaret Thatcher .
And she put in the world &apos;s first national needle exchange program , and other countries followed suit : Australia , The Netherlands and few others .
And in all of those countries , you can see , not more than four percent of injectors ever became infected with HIV .
Now , places that didn &apos;t do this -- New York City for example , Moscow , Jakarta -- we &apos;re talking , at its peak , one in two injectors infected with this fatal disease .
Now , Margaret Thatcher didn &apos;t do this because she has any great love for junkies .
She did it because she ran a country that had a national health service .
So , if she didn &apos;t invest in effective prevention , she was going to have pick up the costs of treatment later on , and obviously those are much higher .
So she was making a politically rational decision .
Now , if I take out my public health nerd glasses here and look at these data , it seems like a no-brainer , doesn &apos;t it ?
But in this country , where the government apparently does not feel compelled to provide health care for citizens , we &apos;ve taken a very different approach .
So what we &apos;ve been doing in the United States is reviewing the data -- endlessly reviewing the data .
So , these are reviews of hundreds of studies by all the big muckety-mucks of the scientific pantheon in the United States , and these are the studies that show needle programs are effective -- quite a lot of them .
Now , the ones that show that needle programs aren &apos;t effective -- you think that &apos;s one of these annoying dynamic slides and I &apos;m going to press my dongle and the rest of it &apos;s going to come up , but no -- that &apos;s the whole slide .
There is nothing on the other side .
So , completely irrational , you would think .
Except that , wait a minute , politicians are rational , too , and they &apos;re responding to what they think the voters want .
So what we see is that voters respond very well to things like this and not quite so well to things like this .
So it becomes quite rational to deny services to injectors .
Now let &apos;s talk about sex .
Are we any more rational about sex ?
Well , I &apos;m not even going to address the clearly irrational positions of people like the Catholic Church , who think somehow that if you give out condoms , everyone &apos;s going to run out and have sex .
I don &apos;t know if Pope Benedict watches TEDTalks online , but if you do , I &apos;ve got news for you Benedict -- I carry condoms all the time and I never get laid .
It &apos;s not that easy !
Here , maybe you &apos;ll have better luck .
Okay , seriously , HIV is actually not that easy to transmit sexually .
So , it depends on how much virus there is in your blood and in your body fluids .
And what we &apos;ve got is a very , very high level of virus right at the beginning when you &apos;re first infected , then you start making antibodies , and then it bumps along at quite low levels for a long time -- 10 or 12 years -- you have spikes if you get another sexually transmitted infection .
But basically , nothing much is going on until you start to get symptomatic AIDS , and by that stage , you &apos;re not looking great , you &apos;re not feeling great , you &apos;re not having that much sex .
So the sexual transmission of HIV is essentially determined by how many partners you have in these very short spaces of time when you have peak viremia .
Now , this makes people crazy because it means that you have to talk about some groups having more sexual partners in shorter spaces of time than other groups , and that &apos;s considered stigmatizing .
I &apos;ve always been a bit curious about that because I think stigma is a bad thing , whereas lots of sex is quite a good thing , but we &apos;ll leave that be .
The truth is that 20 years of very good research have shown us that there are groups that are more likely to turnover large numbers of partners in a short space of time .
And those groups are , globally , people who sell sex and their more regular partners .
They are gay men on the party scene who have , on average , three times more partners than straight people on the party scene .
And they are heterosexuals who come from countries that have traditions of polygamy and relatively high levels of female autonomy , and almost all of those countries are in east or southern Africa .
And that is reflected in the epidemic that we have today .
You can see these horrifying figures from Africa .
These are all countries in southern Africa where between one in seven , and one in three of all adults , are infected with HIV .
Now , in the rest of the world , we &apos;ve got basically nothing going on in the general population -- very , very low levels -- but we have extraordinarily high levels of HIV in these other populations who are at highest risk : drug injectors , sex workers and gay men .
And you &apos;ll note , that &apos;s the local data from Los Angeles : 25 percent prevalence among gay men .
Of course , you can &apos;t get HIV just by having unprotected sex .
You can only HIV by having unprotected sex with a positive person .
In most of the world , these few prevention failures notwithstanding , we are actually doing quite well these days in commercial sex : condom use rates are between 80 and 100 percent in commercial sex in most countries .
And , again , it &apos;s because of an alignment of the incentives .
What &apos;s rational for public health is also rational for individual sex workers because it &apos;s really bad for business to have another STI .
No one wants it .
And , actually , clients don &apos;t want to go home with a drip either .
So essentially , you &apos;re able to achieve quite high rates of condom use in commercial sex .
But in &quot; intimate &quot; relations it &apos;s much more difficult because , with your wife or your boyfriend or someone that you hope might turn into one of those things , we have this illusion of romance and trust and intimacy , and nothing is quite so unromantic as the , &quot; My condom or yours , darling ? &quot; question .
So in the face of that , you really need quite a strong incentive to use condoms .
This , for example , this gentleman is called Joseph .
He &apos;s from Haiti and he has AIDS .
And he &apos;s probably not having a lot of sex right now , but he is a reminder in the population , of why you might want to be using condoms .
This is also in Haiti and is a reminder of why you might want to be having sex , perhaps .
Now , funnily enough , this is also Joseph after six months on antiretroviral treatment .
Not for nothing do we call it the Lazarus Effect .
But it is changing the equation of what &apos;s rational in sexual decision-making .
So , what we &apos;ve got -- some people say , &quot; Oh , it doesn &apos;t matter very much because , actually , treatment is effective prevention because it lowers your viral load and therefore makes it more difficult to transmit HIV . &quot;
So , if you look at the viremia thing again , if you do start treatment when you &apos;re sick , well , what happens ? Your viral load comes down .
But compared to what ? What happens if you &apos;re not on treatment ?
Well , you die , so your viral load goes to zero .
And all of this green stuff here , including the spikes -- which are because you couldn &apos;t get to the pharmacy , or you ran out of drugs , or you went on a three day party binge and forgot to take your drugs , or because you &apos;ve started to get resistance , or whatever -- all of that is virus that wouldn &apos;t be out there , except for treatment .
Now , am I saying , &quot; Oh , well , great prevention strategy .
Let &apos;s just stop treating people . &quot;
Of course not , of course not .
We need to expand antiretroviral treatment as much as we can .
But what I am doing is calling into question those people who say that more treatment is all the prevention we need .
That &apos;s simply not necessarily true , and I think we can learn a lot from the experience of gay men in rich countries where treatment has been widely available for going on 15 years now .
And what we &apos;ve seen is that , actually , condom use rates , which were very , very high -- the gay community responded very rapidly to HIV , with extremely little help from public health nerds , I would say -- that condom use rate has come down dramatically since treatment for two reasons really : One is the assumption of , &quot; Oh well , if he &apos;s infected , he &apos;s probably on meds , and his viral load &apos;s going to be low , so I &apos;m pretty safe . &quot;
And the other thing is that people are simply not as scared of HIV as they were of AIDS , and rightly so .
AIDS was a disfiguring disease that killed you , and HIV is an invisible virus that makes you take a pill every day .
And that &apos;s boring , but is it as boring as having to use a condom every time you have sex , no matter how drunk you are , no matter how many poppers you &apos;ve taken , whatever ?
If we look at the data , we can see that the answer to that question is , mmm .
So these are data from Scotland .
You see the peak in drug injectors before they started the national needle exchange program .
Then it came way down .
And both in heterosexuals -- mostly in commercial sex -- and in drug users , you &apos;ve really got nothing much going on after treatment begins , and that &apos;s because of that alignment of incentives that I talked about earlier .
But in gay men , you &apos;ve got quite a dramatic rise starting three or four years after treatment became widely available .
This is of new infections .
What does that mean ?
It means that the combined effect of being less worried and having more virus out there in the population -- more people living longer , healthier lives , more likely to be getting laid with HIV -- is outweighing the effects of lower viral load , and that &apos;s a very worrisome thing .
What does it mean ?
It means we need to be doing more prevention the more treatment we have .
Is that what &apos;s happening ?
No , and I call it the &quot; compassion conundrum . &quot;
We &apos;ve talked a lot about compassion the last couple of days , and what &apos;s happening really is that people are unable quite to bring themselves to put in good sexual and reproductive health services for sex workers , unable quite to be giving out needles to junkies .
But once they &apos;ve gone from being transgressive people whose behaviors we don &apos;t want to condone to being AIDS victims , we come over all compassionate and buy them incredibly expensive drugs for the rest of their lives .
It doesn &apos;t make any sense from a public health point of view .
I want to give what &apos;s very nearly the last word to Ines .
Ines is a a transgender hooker on the streets of Jakarta ; she &apos;s a chick with a dick .
Why does she do that job ?
Well , of course , because she &apos;s forced into it because she doesn &apos;t have any better option , etc . , etc .
And if we could just teach her to sew and get her a nice job in a factory , all would be well .
This is what factory workers earn in an hour in Indonesia : on average , 20 cents .
It varies a bit province to province .
I do speak to sex workers , 15,000 of them for this particular slide , and this is what sex workers say they earn in an hour .
So it &apos;s not a great job , but for a lot of people it really is quite a rational choice .
Okay , Ines .
We &apos;ve got the tools , the knowledge and the cash , and commitment to preventing HIV too .
Ines : So why is prevalence still rising ?
It &apos;s all politics .
When you get to politics , nothing makes sense .
Elizabeth Pisani : &quot; When you get to politics , nothing makes sense . &quot;
So , from the point of view of a sex worker , politicians are making no sense .
From the point of view of a public health nerd , junkies are doing dumb things .
The truth is that everyone has a different rationale .
There are as many different ways of being rational as there are human beings on the planet , and that &apos;s one of the glories of human existence .
But those ways of being rational are not independent of one another , so it &apos;s rational for a drug injector to share needles because of a stupid decision that &apos;s made by a politician , and it &apos;s rational for a politician to make that stupid decision because they &apos;re responding to what they think the voters want .
But here &apos;s the thing : we are the voters .
We &apos;re not all of them , of course , but TED is a community of opinion leaders .
And everyone who &apos;s in this room , and everyone who &apos;s watching this out there on the web , I think , has a duty to demand of their politicians that we make policy based on scientific evidence and on common sense .
It &apos;s going to be really hard for us to individually affect what &apos;s rational for every Frankie and every Ines out there , but you can at least use your vote to stop politicians doing stupid things that spread HIV .
Thank you .
Ellen Dunham-Jones : Retrofitting suburbia
Ellen Dunham-Jones fires the starting shot for the next 50 years &apos; big sustainable design project : retrofitting suburbia . To come : Dying malls rehabilitated , dead &quot; big box &quot; stores re-inhabited , parking lots transformed into thriving wetlands . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
In the last 50 years , we &apos;ve been building the suburbs with a lot of unintended consequences .
And I &apos;m going to talk about some of those consequences and just present a whole bunch of really interesting projects that I think give us tremendous reasons to be really optimistic that the big design and development project of the next 50 years is going to be retrofitting suburbia .
So whether it &apos;s redeveloping dying malls or re-inhabiting dead big-box stores or reconstructing wetlands out of parking lots , I think the fact is the growing number of empty and under-performing , especially retail , sites throughout suburbia gives us actually a tremendous opportunity to take our least-sustainable landscapes right now and convert them into more sustainable places .
And in the process , what that allows us to do is to redirect a lot more of our growth back into existing communities that could use a boost , and have the infrastructure in place , instead of continuing to tear down trees and to tear up the green space out at the edges .
So why is this important ?
I think there are any number of reasons , and I &apos;m just going to not get into detail but mention a few .
Just from the perspective of climate change , the average urban dweller in the U.S.
has about one-third the carbon footprint of the average suburban dweller , mostly because suburbanites drive a lot more , and living in detached buildings , you have that much more exterior surface to leak energy out of .
So strictly from a climate change perspective , the cities are already relatively green .
The big opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is actually in urbanizing the suburbs .
All that driving that we &apos;ve been doing out in the suburbs , we have doubled the amount of miles we drive .
It &apos;s increased our dependence on foreign oil despite the gains in fuel efficiency .
We &apos;re just driving so much more ; we haven &apos;t been able to keep up technologically .
Public health is another reason to consider retrofitting .
Researchers at the CDC and other places have increasingly been linking suburban development patterns with sedentary lifestyles .
And those have been linked then with the rather alarming , growing rates of obesity , shown in these maps here , and that obesity has also been triggering great increases in heart disease and diabetes to the point where a child born today has a one-in-three chance of developing diabetes .
And that rate has been escalating at the same rate as children not walking to school anymore , again , because of our development patterns .
And then there &apos;s finally -- there &apos;s the affordability question .
I mean , how affordable is it to continue to live in suburbia with rising gas prices ?
Suburban expansion to cheap land , for the last 50 years -- you know the cheap land out on the edge -- has helped generations of families enjoy the American dream .
But increasingly , the savings promised by drive-till-you-qualify affordability -- which is basically our model -- those savings are wiped out when you consider the transportation costs .
For instance , here in Atlanta , about half of households make between $ 20,000 and $ 50,000 a year , and they are spending 29 percent of their income on housing and 32 percent on transportation .
I mean , that &apos;s 2005 figures .
That &apos;s before we got up to the four bucks a gallon .
You know , none of us really tend to do the math on our transportation costs , and they &apos;re not going down any time soon .
Whether you love suburbia &apos;s leafy privacy or you hate its soulless commercial strips , there are reasons why it &apos;s important to retrofit .
But is it practical ?
I think it is .
June Williamson and I have been researching this topic for over a decade , and we &apos;ve found over 80 varied projects .
But that they &apos;re really all market driven , and what &apos;s driving the market in particular -- number one -- is major demographic shifts .
We all tend to think of suburbia as this very family-focused place , but that &apos;s really not the case anymore .
Since 2000 , already two-thirds of households in suburbia did not have kids in them .
We just haven &apos;t caught up with the actual realities of this .
The reasons for this have a lot to with the dominance of the two big demographic groups right now : the Baby Boomers retiring -- and then there &apos;s a gap , Generation X , which is a small generation .
They &apos;re still having kids -- but Generation Y hasn &apos;t even started hitting child-rearing age .
They &apos;re the other big generation .
So as a result of that , demographers predict that through 2025 , 75 to 85 percent of new households will not have kids in them .
And the market research , consumer research , asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we &apos;re already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia .
That basically , the Boomers want to be able to age in place , and Gen Y would like to live an urban lifestyle , but most of their jobs will continue to be out in suburbia .
The other big dynamic of change is the sheer performance of underperforming asphalt .
Now I keep thinking this would be a great name for an indie rock band , but developers generally use it to refer to underused parking lots -- and suburbia is full of them .
When the postwar suburbs were first built out on the cheap land away from downtown , it made sense to just build surface parking lots .
But those sites have now been leapfrogged and leapfrogged again , as we &apos;ve just continued to sprawl , and they now have a relatively central location .
It no longer just makes sense .
That land is more valuable than just surface parking lots .
It now makes sense to go back in , build a deck and build up on those sites .
So what do you do with a dead mall , dead office park ?
It turns out , all sorts of things .
In a slow economy like ours , re-inhabitation is one of the more popular strategies .
So this happens to be a dead mall in St. Louis that &apos;s been re-inhabited as art-space .
It &apos;s now home to artist studios , theater groups , dance troupes .
It &apos;s not pulling in as much tax revenue as it once was , but it &apos;s serving its community .
It &apos;s keeping the lights on .
It &apos;s becoming , I think , a really great institution .
Other malls have been re-inhabited as nursing homes , as universities , and as all variety of office space .
We also found a lot of examples of dead big-box stores that have been converted into all sorts of community-serving uses as well -- lots of schools , lots of churches and lots of libraries like this one .
This was a little grocery store , a Food Lion grocery store , that is now a public library .
In addition to , I think , doing a beautiful adaptive reuse , they tore up some of the parking spaces , put in bioswales to collect and clean the runoff , put in a lot more sidewalks to connect to the neighborhoods .
And they &apos;ve made this , what was just a store along a commercial strip , into a community gathering space .
This one is a little L-shaped strip shopping center in Phoenix , Arizona .
Really all they did was they gave it a fresh coat of bright paint , a gourmet grocery , and they put up a restaurant in the old post office .
Never underestimate the power of food to turn a place around and make it a destination .
It &apos;s been so successful , they &apos;ve now taken over the strip across the street .
The real estate ads in the neighborhood all very proudly proclaim , &quot; Walking distance to Le Grande Orange , &quot; because it provided its neighborhood with what sociologists like to call &quot; a third place . &quot;
If home is the first place and work is the second place , the third place is where you go to hang out and build community .
And especially as suburbia is becoming less centered on the family , the family households , there &apos;s a real hunger for more third places .
So the most dramatic retrofits are really those in the next category , the next strategy : redevelopment .
Now , during the boom , there were several really dramatic redevelopment projects where the original building was scraped to the ground and then the whole site was rebuilt at significantly greater density , a sort of compact , walkable urban neighborhoods .
But some of them have been much more incremental .
This is Mashpee Commons , the oldest retrofit that we &apos;ve found .
And it &apos;s just incrementally , over the last 20 years , built urbanism on top of its parking lots .
So the black and white photo shows the simple 60 &apos;s strip shopping center .
And then the maps above that show its gradual transformation into a compact , mixed-use New England village , and it has plans now that have been approved for it to connect to new residential neighborhoods across the arterials and over to the other side .
So , you know , sometimes it &apos;s incremental .
Sometimes , it &apos;s all at once .
This is another infill project on the parking lots , this one of an office park outside of Washington D.C.
When Metrorail expanded transit into the suburbs and opened a station nearby to this site , the owners decided to build a new parking deck and then insert on top of their surface lots a new Main Street , several apartments and condo buildings , while keeping the existing office buildings .
Here is the site in 1940 : It was just a little farm in the village of Hyattsville .
By 1980 , it had been subdivided into a big mall on one side and the office park on the other and then some buffer sites for a library and a church to the far right .
Today , the transit , the Main Street and the new housing have all been built .
Eventually , I expect that the streets will probably extend through a redevelopment of the mall .
Plans have already been announced for a lot of those garden apartments above the mall to be redeveloped .
Transit is a big driver of retrofits .
So here &apos;s what it looks like .
You can sort of see the funky new condo buildings in between the office buildings and the public space and the new Main Street .
This one is one of my favorites , Belmar .
I think they really built an attractive place here and have just employed all-green construction .
There &apos;s massive P.V. arrays on the roofs as well as wind turbines .
This was a very large mall on a hundred-acre superblock .
It &apos;s now 22 walkable urban blocks with public streets , two public parks , eight bus lines and a range of housing types , and so it &apos;s really given Lakewood , Colorado the downtown that this particular suburb never had .
Here was the mall in its heyday .
They had their prom in the mall . They loved their mall .
So here &apos;s the site in 1975 with the mall .
By 1995 , the mall has died .
The department store has been kept -- and we found this was true in many cases .
The department stores are multistory ; they &apos;re better built .
They &apos;re easy to be re-adapted .
But the one story stuff ...
that &apos;s really history .
So here it is at projected build-out .
This project , I think , has great connectivity to the existing neighborhoods .
It &apos;s providing 1,500 households with the option of a more urban lifestyle .
It &apos;s about two-thirds built out right now .
Here &apos;s what the new Main Street looks like .
It &apos;s very successful , and it &apos;s helped to prompt -- regional malls in Denver have now , or have announced plans to be , retrofitted .
But it &apos;s important to note that all of this retrofitting is not occurring -- just bulldozers are coming and just plowing down the whole city .
No , it &apos;s pockets of walkability on the sites of under-performing properties .
And so it &apos;s giving people more choices , but it &apos;s not taking away choices .
But it &apos;s also not really enough to just create pockets of walkability .
You want to also try to get more systemic transformation .
We need to also retrofit the corridors themselves .
So this is one that has been retrofitted in California .
They took the commercial strip shown on the black-and-white images below , and they built a boulevard that has become the Main Street for their town .
And it &apos;s transformed from being an ugly , unsafe , undesirable address , to becoming a beautiful , attractive , dignified sort of good address .
I mean now we &apos;re hoping we start to see it ; they &apos;ve already built City Hall , attracted two hotels .
I could imagine beautiful housing going up along there without tearing down another tree .
So there &apos;s a lot of great things , but I &apos;d love to see more corridors getting retrofitting .
But densification is not going to work everywhere .
Sometimes re-greening is really the better answer .
There &apos;s a lot to learn from successful landbanking programs in cities like Flint , Michigan .
There &apos;s also a burgeoning suburban farming movement -- sort of victory gardens meets the Internet .
But perhaps one of the most important re-greening aspects is the opportunity to restore the local ecology , as in this example outside of Minneapolis .
When the shopping center died , the city restored the site &apos;s original wetlands , creating lakefront property , which then attracted private investment , the first private investment to this very low-income neighborhood in over 40 years .
So they &apos;ve managed to both restore the local ecology and the local economy at the same time .
This is another re-greening example .
It also makes sense in very strong markets .
This one in Seattle is on the site of a mall parking lot adjacent to a new transit stop .
And the wavy line is a path alongside a creek that has now been daylit .
The creek had been culverted under the parking lot .
But daylighting our creeks really improves their water quality and contributions to habitat .
So I &apos;ve shown you some of the first generation of retrofits .
What &apos;s next ?
I think we have three challenges for the future .
The first is to plan retrofitting much more systemically at the metropolitan scale .
We need to be able to target which areas really should be re-greened .
Where should we be redeveloping ?
And where should we be encouraging re-inhabitation ?
These slides just show two images from a larger project that looked at trying to do that for Atlanta .
I led a team that was asked to imagine Atlanta 100 years from now .
And we chose to try to reverse sprawl through three simple moves -- expensive , but simple .
One , in a hundred years , transit on all major rail and road corridors .
Two , in a hundred years , thousand foot buffers on all stream corridors .
It &apos;s a little extreme , but we &apos;ve got a little water problem .
In a hundred years , subdivisions that simply end up too close to water or too far from transit won &apos;t be viable .
And so we &apos;ve created the eco-acre transfer-to-transfer development rights to the transit corridors and allow the re-greening of those former subdivisions for food and energy production .
So the second challenge is to improve the architectural design quality of the retrofits .
And I close with this image of democracy in action : This is a protest that &apos;s happening on a retrofit in Silver Spring , Maryland on an Astroturf town green .
Now , retrofits are often accused of being examples of faux downtowns and instant urbanism , and not without reason ; you don &apos;t get much more phony than an Astroturf town green .
I have to say , these are very hybrid places .
They are new but trying to look old .
They have urban streetscapes , but suburban parking ratios .
Their populations are more diverse than typical suburbia , but they &apos;re less diverse than cities .
And they are public places , but that are managed by private companies .
And just the surface appearance are often -- like the Astroturf here -- they make me wince .
So , you know , I mean I &apos;m glad that the urbanism is doing its job .
The fact that a protest is happening really does mean that the layout of the blocks , the streets and blocks , the putting in of public space , compromised as it may be , is still a really great thing .
But we &apos;ve got to get the architecture better .
The final challenge is for all of you .
I want you to join the protest and start demanding more sustainable suburban places -- more sustainable places , period .
But culturally , we tend to think that downtowns should be dynamic , and we expect that .
But we seem to have an expectation that the suburbs should forever remain frozen in whatever adolescent form they were first given birth to .
It &apos;s time to let them grow up , so I want you to all support the zoning changes , the road diets , the infrastructure improvements and the retrofits that are coming soon to a neighborhood near you .
Thank you .
Mitchell Besser : Mothers helping mothers fight HIV
In sub-Saharan Africa , HIV infections are more prevalent and doctors scarcer than anywhere else in the world . With a lack of medical professionals , Mitchell Besser enlisted the help of his patients to create mothers2mothers -- an extraordinary network of HIV-positive women whose support for each other is changing and saving lives .
I want you to take a trip with me .
Picture yourself driving down a small road in Africa , and as you drive along , you look off to the side , and this is what you see : you see a field of graves .
And you stop , and you get out of your car and you take a picture .
And you go into the town , and you inquire , &quot; What &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
and people are initially reluctant to tell you .
And then someone says , &quot; These are the recent AIDS deaths in our community . &quot;
HIV isn &apos;t like other medical conditions ; it &apos;s stigmatizing .
People are reluctant to talk about it -- there &apos;s a fear associated with it .
And I &apos;m going to talk about HIV today , about the deaths , about the stigma .
It &apos;s a medical story , but more than that , it &apos;s a social story .
This map depicts the global distribution of HIV .
And as you can see , Africa has a disproportionate share of the infection .
There are 33 million people living with HIV in the world today .
Of these , two-thirds , 22 million are living in sub-Saharan Africa .
There are 1.4 million pregnant women in low- and middle-income countries living with HIV and of these , 90 percent are in sub-Saharan Africa .
We talk about things in relative terms .
And I &apos;m going to talk about annual pregnancies and HIV-positive mothers .
The United States -- a large country -- each year , 7,000 mothers with HIV who give birth to a child .
But you go to Rwanda -- a very small country -- 8,000 mothers with HIV who are pregnant .
And then you go to Baragwanath Hospital , outside of Johannesburg in South Africa , and 8,000 HIV-positive pregnant women giving birth -- a hospital the same as a country .
And to realize that this is just the tip of an iceberg that when you compare everything here to South Africa , it just pales , because in South Africa , each year 300,000 mothers with HIV give birth to children .
So we talk about PMTCT , and we refer to PMTCT , prevention of mother to child transmission .
I think there &apos;s an assumption amongst most people in the public that if a mother is HIV-positive , she &apos;s going to infect her child .
The reality is really , very different .
In resource-rich countries , with all the tests and treatment we currently have , less than two percent of babies are born HIV-positive -- 98 percent of babies are born HIV-negative .
And yet , the reality in resource-poor countries , in the absence of tests and treatment , 40 percent -- 40 percent of children are infected -- 40 percent versus two percent -- an enormous difference .
So these programs -- and I &apos;m going to refer to PMTCT though my talk -- these prevention programs , simply , they &apos;re the tests and the drugs that we give to mothers to prevent them from infecting their babies , and also the medicines we give to mothers to keep them healthy and alive to raise their children .
So it &apos;s the test a mother gets when she comes in .
It &apos;s the drugs she receives to protect the baby that &apos;s inside the uterus and during delivery .
It &apos;s the guidance she gets around infant feeding and safer sex .
It &apos;s an entire package of services , and it works .
So in the United States , since the advent of treatment in the middle of the 1990s , there &apos;s been an 80-percent decline in the number of HIV-infected children .
Less than 100 babies are born with HIV each year in the United States and yet , still , over 400,000 children are born every year in the world today with HIV .
What does that mean ?
It means 1,100 children infected each day -- 1,100 children each day , infected with HIV .
And where do they come from ?
Well , less than one comes from the United States .
One , on average , comes from Europe .
100 come from Asia and the Pacific .
And each day , a thousand babies -- a thousand babies are born each day with HIV in Africa .
So again , I look at the globe here and the disproportionate share of HIV in Africa .
And let &apos;s look at another map .
And here , again , we see Africa has a disproportionate share of the numbers of doctors .
That thin sliver you see here , that &apos;s Africa .
And it &apos;s the same with nurses .
The truth is sub-Saharan Africa has 24 percent of the global disease burden and yet only three percent of the world &apos;s health care workers .
That means doctors and nurses simply don &apos;t have the time to take care of patients .
A nurse in a busy clinic will see 50 to 100 patients in a day , which leaves her just minutes per patient -- minutes per patient .
And so when we look at these PMTCT programs , what does it mean ?
Well , back in 2001 , when there was just a simple test and a single dose of a drug , a nurse , in the course of her few minutes with a patient , would have to counsel for the HIV test , perform the HIV test , explain the results , dispense a single dose of the drug , Nevirapine , explain how to take it , discuss infant feeding options , reinforce infant feeding , and test the baby -- in minutes .
Well , fortunately since 2001 , we &apos;ve got new treatments , new tests , and we &apos;re far more successful , but we don &apos;t have any more nurses .
And so these are the tests a nurse now has to do in those same few minutes .
It &apos;s not possible -- it doesn &apos;t work .
And so we need to find better ways of providing care .
This is a picture of a maternal health clinic in Africa -- mothers coming , pregnant and with their babies .
These women are here for care , but we know that just doing a test , just giving someone a drug , it &apos;s not enough .
Meds don &apos;t equal medical care .
Doctors and nurses , frankly , don &apos;t have the time or skills to tell people what to do in ways they understand .
I &apos;m a doctor -- I tell people things to do , and I expect them to follow my guidance -- because I &apos;m a doctor ; I went to Harvard -- but the reality is , if I tell a patient , &quot; You should have safer sex .
You should always use a condom , &quot; and yet , in her relationship , she &apos;s not empowered -- what &apos;s going to happen ?
If I tell her to take her medicines every day and yet , no one in the household knows about her illness , so it &apos;s just not going to work .
And so we need to do more , we need to do it differently , we need to do it in ways that are affordable and accessible and can be taken to scale , which means it can be done everywhere .
So , I want to tell you a story -- I want to take you on a little trip .
Imagine yourself , if you can , you &apos;re a young woman in Africa , you &apos;re going to the hospital or clinic .
You go in for a test and you find out that you &apos;re pregnant , and you &apos;re delighted .
And then they give you another test and they tell you you &apos;re HIV-positive , and you &apos;re devastated .
And the nurse takes you into a room , and she tells you about the tests and HIV and the medicines you can take and how to take care of yourself and your baby , and you hear none of it .
All you &apos;re hearing is , &quot; I &apos;m going to die , and my baby is going to die . &quot;
And then you &apos;re out on the street , and you don &apos;t know where to go .
And you don &apos;t know who you can talk to , because the truth is , HIV is so stigmatizing that if you partner , your family , anyone in your home , you &apos;re likely to be thrown out without any means of support .
And this -- this is the face and story of HIV in Africa today .
But we &apos;re here to talk about possible solutions and some good news .
And I want to change the story a little bit .
Take the same mother , and the nurse , after she gives her her test , takes her to a room .
The door opens and there &apos;s a room full of mothers , mothers with babies , and they &apos;re sitting , and they &apos;re talking , they &apos;re listening .
They &apos;re drinking tea , they &apos;re having sandwiches .
And she goes inside , and woman comes up to her and says , &quot; Welcome to mothers2mothers .
Have a seat . You &apos;re safe here .
We &apos;re all HIV-positive .
You &apos;re going to be okay . You &apos;re going to live .
Your baby is going to be HIV-negative . &quot;
We view mothers as a community &apos;s single greatest resource .
Mothers take care of the children , take care of the home .
So often the men are gone .
They &apos;re working , or they &apos;re not part of the household .
Our organization , mothers2mothers , enlists women with HIV as care providers .
We bring mothers who have HIV , who &apos;ve been through these PMTCT programs in the very facilities , to come back and work side by side with doctors and nurses as part of the health care team .
These mothers , we call them mentor mothers , are able to engage women who , just like themselves , pregnant with babies , have found out about being HIV-positive , who need support and education .
And they support them around the diagnosis and educate them about how to take their medicines , how to take care of themselves , how to take care of their babies .
Consider : if you needed surgery , you would want the best possible technical surgeon , right ?
But if you wanted to understand what that surgery would do to your life , you &apos;d like to engage someone , someone who &apos;s had the procedure .
Patients are experts on their own experience , and they can share that experience with others .
This is the medical care that goes beyond just medicines .
So the mothers who work for us , they come from the communities in which they work .
They &apos;re hired -- they &apos;re paid as professional members of the health care teams , just like doctors and nurses .
And we open bank accounts for them and they &apos;re paid directly into the accounts , because their money &apos;s protected ; the men can &apos;t take it away from them .
They go through two to three weeks of rigorous curriculum-based education , training .
Now , doctors and nurses -- they too get trained .
But so often , they only get trained once , so they &apos;re not aware of new medicines , new guidelines as they come out .
Our mentor mothers get trained every single year and retrained .
And so doctors and nurses -- they look up to them as experts .
Imagine that : a woman , a former patient , being able to educate her doctor for the first time and educate the other patients that she &apos;s taking care of .
Our organization has three goals .
The first , to prevent mother-to-child transmission .
The second : keep mothers healthy , keep mothers alive , keep the children alive -- no more orphans .
And the third , and maybe the most grand , is to find ways to empower women , enable them to fight the stigma and to live positive and productive lives with HIV .
So how do we do it ?
Well , maybe the most important engagement is the one-to-one , seeing patients one-to-one , educating them , supporting them , explaining how they can take care of themselves .
We go beyond that ; we try to bring in the husbands , the partners .
In Africa , it &apos;s very , very hard to engage men .
Men are not frequently part of pregnancy care .
But in Rwanda , in one country , they &apos;ve got a policy that a woman can &apos;t come for care unless she brings the father of the baby with her -- that &apos;s the rule .
And so the father and the mother , together , go through the counseling and the testing .
The father and the mother , together , they get the results .
And this is so important in breaking through the stigma .
Disclosure is so central to prevention .
How do you have safer sex , how do you use a condom regularly if there hasn &apos;t been disclosure ?
Disclosure is so important to treatment , because again , people need the support of family members and friends to take their medicines regularly .
We also work in groups .
Now the groups , it &apos;s not like me lecturing , but what happens is women , they come together -- under the support and guidance of our mentor mothers -- they come together , and they share their personal experiences .
And it &apos;s through the sharing that people get tactics of how to take care of themselves , how to disclose how to take medicines .
And then there &apos;s the community outreach , engaging women in their communities .
If we can change the way households believe and think , we can change the way communities believe and think .
And if we can change enough communities , we can change national attitudes .
We can change national attitudes to women and national attitudes to HIV .
The hardest barrier really is around stigma reduction .
We have the medicines , we have the tests , but how do you reduce the stigma ?
And it &apos;s important about disclosure .
So , a couple years ago , one of the mentor mothers came back , and she told me a story .
She had been asked by one of the clients to go to the home of the client , because the client wanted to tell the mother and her brothers and sisters about her HIV status , and she was afraid to go by herself .
And so the mentor mother went along with .
And the patient walked into the house and said to her mother and siblings , &quot; I have something to tell you . I &apos;m HIV-positive . &quot;
And everybody was quiet .
And then her oldest brother stood up and said , &quot; I too have something to tell you .
I &apos;m HIV-positive .
I &apos;ve been afraid to tell everybody . &quot;
And then this older sister stood up and said , &quot; I too am living with the virus , and I &apos;ve been ashamed . &quot;
And then her younger brother stood up and said , &quot; I &apos;m also positive .
I thought you were going to throw me out of the family . &quot;
And you see where this is going .
The last sister stood up and said , &quot; I &apos;m also positive .
I thought you were going to hate me . &quot;
And there they were , all of them together for the first time being able to share this experience for the first time and to support each other for the first time .
Female Women come to us , and they are crying and scared .
I tell them my story , that I am HIV-positive , but my child is HIV-negative .
I tell them , &quot; You are going to make it , and you will raise a healthy baby . &quot;
I am proof that there is hope .
Mitchell Besser : Remember the images I showed you of how few doctors and nurses there are in Africa .
And it is a crisis in health care systems .
Even as we have more tests and more drugs , we can &apos;t reach people ; we don &apos;t have enough providers .
So we talk in terms of what we call task-shifting .
Task-shifting is traditionally when you take health care services from one provider and have another provider do it .
Typically , it &apos;s a doctor giving a job to a nurse .
And the issue in Africa is that there are fewer nurses , really than doctors , and so we need to find new paradigm for health care .
How do you build a better health care system ?
We &apos;ve chosen to redefine the health care system as a doctor , a nurse and a mentor mother .
And so what nurses do is that they ask the mentor mothers to explain how to take the drugs , the side effects .
They delegate education about infant feeding , family planning , safer sex , actions that nurses simple just don &apos;t have time for .
So we go back to the prevention of mother to child transmission .
The world is increasingly seeing these programs as the bridge to comprehensive maternal and child health .
And our organization helps women across that bridge .
The care doesn &apos;t stop when the baby &apos;s born -- we deal with the ongoing health of the mother and baby , ensuring that they live healthy , successful lives .
Our organization works on three levels .
The first , at the patient level -- mothers and babies keeping babies from getting HIV , keeping mothers healthy to raise them .
The second , communities -- empowering women .
They become leaders within their communities .
They change the way communities think -- we need to change attitudes to HIV .
We need to change attitudes to women in Africa .
We have to do that .
And then rework the level of the health care systems , building stronger health care systems .
Our health care systems are broken .
They &apos;re not going to work the way they &apos;re currently designed .
And so doctors and nurses who need to try to change people &apos;s behaviors don &apos;t have the skills , don &apos;t have the time -- our mentor mothers do .
And so in redefining the health care teams by bringing the mentor mothers in , we can do that .
I started the program in Capetown , South Africa back in 2001 .
It was at that point , just the spark of an idea .
Referencing Steven Johnson &apos;s very lovely speech yesterday on where ideas come from , I was in the shower at the time -- I was alone .
The program is now working in nine countries , we have 670 program sites , we &apos;re seeing about 230,000 women every month , we &apos;re employing 1,600 mentor mothers , and last year , they enrolled 300,000 HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers .
That is 20 percent of the global HIV-positive pregnant women -- 20 percent of the world .
What &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the premise is .
Mothers with HIV caring for mothers with HIV .
Past patients taking care of present patients .
And empowerment through employment -- reducing stigma .
Female There is hope , hope that one day we shall win this fight against HIV and AIDS .
Each person must know their HIV status .
Those who are HIV-negative must know how to stay negative .
Those who are HIV-infected must know how to take care of themselves .
HIV-positive pregnant women must get PMTCT services in order to have HIV-negative babies .
All of this is possible , if we each contribute to this fight .
MB : Simple solutions to complex problems .
Mothers caring for mothers .
It &apos;s transformational .
Thank you .
Jenna McCarthy : What you don &apos;t know about marriage
In this funny , casual talk from TEDx , writer Jenna McCarthy shares surprising research on how marriages really work . One tip : Do not try to win an Oscar for best actress . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Every year in the United States alone , 2,077,000 couples make a legal and spiritual decision to spend the rest of their lives together ...
and not to have sex with anyone else , ever .
He buys a ring , she buys a dress .
They go shopping for all sorts of things .
She takes him to Arthur Murray for ballroom dancing lessons .
And the big day comes .
And they &apos;ll stand before God and family and some guy her dad once did business with , and they &apos;ll vow that nothing , not abject poverty , not life-threatening illness , not complete and utter misery will ever put the tiniest damper on their eternal love and devotion .
These optimistic young bastards promise to honor and cherish each other through hot flashes and mid-life crises and a cumulative 50-lb. weight gain , until that far-off day when one of them is finally able to rest in peace .
You know , because they can &apos;t hear the snoring anymore .
And then they &apos;ll get stupid drunk and smash cake in each others &apos; faces and do the &quot; Macarena , &quot; and we &apos;ll be there showering them with towels and toasters and drinking their free booze and throwing birdseed at them every single time -- even though we know , statistically , half of them will be divorced within a decade .
Of course , the other half won &apos;t , right ?
They &apos;ll keep forgetting anniversaries and arguing about where to spend holidays and debating which way the toilet paper should come off of the roll .
And some of them will even still be enjoying each others &apos; company when neither of them can chew solid food anymore .
And researchers want to know why .
I mean , look , it doesn &apos;t take a double-blind , placebo-controlled study to figure out what makes a marriage not work .
Disrespect , boredom , too much time on Facebook , having sex with other people .
But you can have the exact opposite of all of those things -- respect , excitement , a broken Internet connection , mind-numbing monogamy -- and the thing still can go to hell in a hand basket .
So what &apos;s going on when it doesn &apos;t ?
What do the folks who make it all the way to side-by-side burial plots have in common ?
What are they doing right ?
What can we learn from them ?
And if you &apos;re still happily sleeping solo , why should you stop what you &apos;re doing and make it your life &apos;s work to find that one special person that you can annoy for the rest of your life ?
Well researchers spend billions of your tax dollars trying to figure that out .
They stalk blissful couples and they study their every move and mannerism .
And they try to pinpoint what it is that sets them apart from their miserable neighbors and friends .
And it turns out , the success stories share a few similarities , actually , beyond they don &apos;t have sex with other people .
For instance , in the happiest marriages , the wife is thinner and better looking than the husband .
Obvious , right .
It &apos;s obvious that this leads to marital bliss because , women , we care a great deal about being thin and good looking , whereas men mostly care about sex ...
ideally with women who are thinner and better looking than they are .
The beauty of this research though is that no one is suggesting that women have to be thin to be happy ; we just have to be thinner than our partners .
So instead of all that laborious dieting and exercising , we just need to wait for them to get fat , maybe bake a few pies .
This is good information to have , and it &apos;s not that complicated .
Research also suggests that the happiest couples are the ones that focus on the positives .
For example , the happy wife .
Instead of pointing out her husband &apos;s growing gut or suggesting he go for a run , she might say , &quot; Wow , honey , thank you for going out of your way to make me relatively thinner . &quot;
These are couples who can find good in any situation .
&quot; Yeah , it was devastating when we lost everything in that fire , but it &apos;s kind of nice sleeping out here under the stars , and it &apos;s a good thing you &apos;ve got all that body fat to keep us warm . &quot;
One of my favorite studies found that the more willing a husband is to do house work , the more attractive his wife will find him .
Because we needed a study to tell us this .
But here &apos;s what &apos;s going on here .
The more attractive she finds him , the more sex they have ; the more sex they have , the nicer he is to her ; the nicer he is to her , the less she nags him about leaving wet towels on the bed -- and ultimately , they live happily ever after .
In other words , men , you might want to pick it up a notch in the domestic department .
Here &apos;s an interesting one .
One study found that people who smile in childhood photographs are less likely to get a divorce .
This is an actual study , and let me clarify .
The researchers were not looking at documented self-reports of childhood happiness or even studying old journals .
The data were based entirely on whether people looked happy in these early pictures .
Now I don &apos;t know how old all of you are , but when I was a kid , your parents took pictures with a special kind of camera that held something called film , and , by God , film was expensive .
They didn &apos;t take 300 shots of you in that rapid-fire digital video mode and then pick out the nicest , smileyest one for the Christmas card .
Oh no .
They dressed you up , they lined you up , and you smiled for the fucking camera like they told you to or you could kiss your birthday party goodbye .
But still , I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I &apos;m glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce .
So what else can you do to safeguard your marriage ?
Do not win an Oscar for best actress .
I &apos;m serious .
Bettie Davis , Joan Crawford , Hallie Berry , Hillary Swank , Sandra Bullock , Reese Witherspoon , all of them single soon after taking home that statue .
They actually call it the Oscar curse .
It is the marriage kiss of death and something that should be avoided .
And it &apos;s not just successfully starring in films that &apos;s dangerous .
It turns out , merely watching a romantic comedy causes relationship satisfaction to plummet .
Apparently , the bitter realization that maybe it could happen to us , but it obviously hasn &apos;t and it probably never will , makes our lives seem unbearably grim in comparison .
And theoretically , I suppose if we opt for a film where someone gets brutally murdered or dies in a fiery car crash , we are more likely to walk out of that theater feeling like we &apos;ve got it pretty good .
Drinking alcohol , it seems , is bad for your marriage .
Yeah .
I can &apos;t tell you anymore about that one because I stopped reading it at the headline .
But here &apos;s a scary one : Divorce is contagious .
That &apos;s right -- when you have a close couple friend split up , it increases your chances of getting a divorce by 75 percent .
Now I have to say , I don &apos;t get this one at all .
My husband and I have watched quite a few friends divide their assets and then struggle with being our age and single in an age of sexting and Viagra and eHarmony .
And I &apos;m thinking they &apos;ve done more for my marriage than a lifetime of therapy ever could .
So now you may be wondering , why does anyone get married ever ?
Well the U.S. federal government counts more than a thousand legal benefits to being someone &apos;s spouse -- a list that includes visitation rights in jail , but hopefully you &apos;ll never need that one .
But beyond the profound federal perks , married people make more money .
We &apos;re healthier , physically and emotionally .
We produce happier , more stable and more successful kids .
We have more sex than our supposedly swinging single friends -- believe it or not .
We even live longer , which is a pretty compelling argument for marrying someone you like a lot in the first place .
Now if you &apos;re not currently experiencing the joy of the joint tax return , I can &apos;t tell you how to find a chore-loving person of the approximately ideal size and attractiveness who prefers horror movies and doesn &apos;t have a lot of friends hovering on the brink of divorce , but I can only encourage you to try , because the benefits , as I &apos;ve pointed out , are significant .
The bottom line is , whether you &apos;re in it or you &apos;re searching for it , I believe marriage is an institution worth pursuing and protecting .
So I hope you &apos;ll use the information I &apos;ve given you today to weigh your personal strengths against your own risk factors .
For instance , in my marriage , I &apos;d say I &apos;m doing okay .
One the one hand , I have a husband who &apos;s annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome .
So I &apos;m obviously going to need fatten him up .
And like I said , we have those divorced friends who may secretly or subconsciously be trying to break us up .
So we have to keep an eye on that .
And we do like a cocktail or two .
On the other hand , I have the fake happy picture thing .
And also , my husband does a lot around the house , and would happily never see another romantic comedy as long as he lives .
So I &apos;ve got all those things going for me .
But just in case , I plan to work extra hard to not win an Oscar anytime soon .
And for the good of your relationships , I would encourage you to do the same .
I &apos;ll see you at the bar .
John Maeda : How art , technology and design inform creative leaders
John Maeda , former President of the Rhode Island School of Design , delivers a funny and charming talk that spans a lifetime of work in art , design and technology , concluding with a picture of creative leadership in the future . Watch for demos of Maeda &apos;s earliest work -- and even a computer made of people .
I have to say that I &apos;m very glad to be here .
I understand we have over 80 countries here , so that &apos;s a whole new paradigm for me to speak to all of these countries .
In each country , I &apos;m sure you have this thing called the parent-teacher conference .
Do you know about the parent-teacher conference ?
Not the ones for your kids , but the one you had as a child , where your parents come to school and your teacher talks to your parents , and it &apos;s a little bit awkward .
Well , I remember in third grade , I had this moment where my father , who never takes off from work , he &apos;s a classical blue collar , a working-class immigrant person , going to school to see his son , how he &apos;s doing , and the teacher said to him , he said , &quot; You know , John is good at math and art . &quot;
And he kind of nodded , you know ?
The next day I saw him talking to a customer at our tofu store , and he said , &quot; You know , John &apos;s good at math . &quot;
And that always stuck with me all my life .
Why didn &apos;t Dad say art ? Why wasn &apos;t it okay ?
Why ? It became a question my entire life , and that &apos;s all right , because being good at math meant he bought me a computer , and some of you remember this computer , this was my first computer .
Who had an Apple II ? Apple II users , very cool .
As you remember , the Apple II did nothing at all .
You &apos;d plug it in , you &apos;d type in it and green text would come out .
It would say you &apos;re wrong most of the time .
That was the computer we knew .
That computer is a computer that I learned about going to MIT , my father &apos;s dream . And at MIT , however , I learned about the computer at all levels , and after , I went to art school to get away from computers , and I began to think about the computer as more of a spiritual space of thinking .
And I was influenced by performance art -- so this is 20 years ago . I made a computer out of people .
It was called the Human Powered Computer Experiment .
I have a power manager , mouse driver , memory , etc . , and I built this in Kyoto , the old capital of Japan .
It &apos;s a room broken in two halves .
I &apos;ve turned the computer on , and these assistants are placing a giant floppy disk built out of cardboard , and it &apos;s put into the computer .
And the floppy disk drive person wears it .
She finds the first sector on the disk , and takes data off the disk and passes it off to , of course , the bus .
So the bus diligently carries the data into the computer to the memory , to the CPU , the VRAM , etc . , and it &apos;s an actual working computer . That &apos;s a bus , really .
And it looks kind of fast . That &apos;s a mouse driver , where it &apos;s XY .
It looks like it &apos;s happening kind of quickly , but it &apos;s actually a very slow computer , and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is , it made me wonder about computers and technology in general .
And so I &apos;m going to talk today about four things , really .
The first three things are about how I &apos;ve been curious about technology , design and art , and how they intersect , how they overlap , and also a topic that I &apos;ve taken on since four years ago I became the President of Rhode Island School of Design : leadership .
And I &apos;ll talk about how I &apos;ve looked to combine these four areas into a kind of a synthesis , a kind of experiment .
So starting from technology , technology is a wonderful thing .
When that Apple II came out , it really could do nothing .
It could show text and after we waited a bit , we had these things called images .
Remember when images were first possible with a computer , those gorgeous , full-color images ?
And then after a few years , we got CD-quality sound .
It was incredible . You could listen to sound on the computer .
And then movies , via CD-ROM . It was amazing .
Remember that excitement ?
And then the browser appeared . The browser was great , but the browser was very primitive , very narrow bandwidth .
Text first , then images , we waited , CD-quality sound over the Net , then movies over the Internet . Kind of incredible .
And then the mobile phone occurred , text , images , audio , video . And now we have iPhone , iPad , Android , with text , video , audio , etc .
You see this little pattern here ?
We &apos;re kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something I &apos;ve been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
And I have a small experiment to give you a quick design lesson .
Designers talk about the relationship between form and content , content and form . Now what does that mean ?
Well , content is the word up there : fear .
It &apos;s a four-letter word . It &apos;s a kind of a bad feeling word , fear .
Fear is set in Light Helvetica , so it &apos;s not too stressful , and if you set it in Ultra Light Helvetica , it &apos;s like , &quot; Oh , fear , who cares ? &quot; Right ?
You take the same Ultra Light Helvetica and make it big , and like , whoa , that hurts . Fear .
So you can see how you change the scale , you change the form . Content is the same , but you feel differently .
You change the typeface to , like , this typeface , and it &apos;s kind of funny . It &apos;s like pirate typeface , like Captain Jack Sparrow typeface . Arr ! Fear !
Like , aww , that &apos;s not fearful . That &apos;s actually funny .
Or fear like this , kind of a nightclub typeface .
Like , we gotta go to Fear .
It &apos;s , like , amazing , right ?
It just changes the same content .
Or you make it -- The letters are separated apart , they &apos;re huddled together like on the deck of the Titanic , and you feel sorry for the letters , like , I feel the fear .
You feel for them .
Or you change the typeface to something like this .
It &apos;s very classy . It &apos;s like that expensive restaurant , Fear .
I can never get in there .
It &apos;s just amazing , Fear . But that &apos;s form , content .
If you just change one letter in that content , you get a much better word , much better content : free .
&quot; Free &quot; is a great word . You can serve it almost any way .
Free bold feels like Mandela free .
It &apos;s like , yes , I can be free .
Free even light feels kind of like , ah , I can breathe in free .
It feels great . Or even free spread out , it &apos;s like , ah , I can breathe in free , so easily .
And I can add in a blue gradient and a dove , and I have , like , Don Draper free .
So you see that -- form , content , design , it works that way .
It &apos;s a powerful thing . It &apos;s like magic , almost , like the magicians we &apos;ve seen at TED . It &apos;s magic .
Design does that .
And I &apos;ve been curious about how design and technology intersect , and I &apos;m going to show you some old work I never really show anymore , to give you a sense of what I used to do .
So -- yeah .
So I made a lot of work in the &apos; 90s .
This was a square that responds to sound .
People ask me why I made that . It &apos;s not clear .
But I thought it &apos;d be neat for the square to respond to me , and my kids were small then , and my kids would play with these things , like , &quot; Aaah , &quot; you know , they would say , &quot; Daddy , aaah , aaah . &quot; You know , like that .
We &apos;d go to a computer store , and they &apos;d do the same thing .
And they &apos;d say , &quot; Daddy , why doesn &apos;t the computer respond to sound ? &quot;
And it was really at the time I was wondering why doesn &apos;t the computer respond to sound ?
So I made this as a kind of an experiment at the time .
And then I spent a lot of time in the space of interactive graphics and things like this , and I stopped doing it because my students at MIT got so much better than myself , so I had to hang up my mouse .
But in &apos; 96 , I made my last piece . It was in black and white , monochrome , fully monochrome , all in integer mathematics .
It &apos;s called &quot; Tap , Type , Write . &quot;
It &apos;s paying a tribute to the wonderful typewriter that my mother used to type on all the time as a legal secretary .
It has 10 variations .
There &apos;s a shift .
Ten variations . This is , like , spin the letter around .
This is , like , a ring of letters .
This is 20 years old , so it &apos;s kind of a -- Let &apos;s see , this is ‚Äî I love the French film &quot; The Red Balloon . &quot;
Great movie , right ? I love that movie . So , this is sort of like a play on that .
It &apos;s peaceful , like that .
I &apos;ll show this last one . This is about balance , you know .
It &apos;s kind of stressful typing out , so if you type on this keyboard , you can , like , balance it out .
If you hit G , life &apos;s okay , so I always say , &quot; Hit G , and it &apos;s going to be all right .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So that was 20 years ago , and I was always on the periphery of art .
By being President of RISD I &apos;ve gone deep into art , and art is a wonderful thing , fine art , pure art .
You know , when people say , &quot; I don &apos;t get art .
I don &apos;t get it at all . &quot; That means art is working , you know ?
It &apos;s like , art is supposed to be enigmatic , so when you say , like , &quot; I don &apos;t get it , &quot; like , oh , that &apos;s great .
Art does that , because art is about asking questions , questions that may not be answerable .
At RISD , we have this amazing facility called the Edna Lawrence Nature Lab . It has 80,000 samples of animal , bone , mineral , plants .
You know , in Rhode Island , if an animal gets hit on the road , they call us up and we pick it up and stuff it .
And why do we have this facility ?
Because at RISD , you have to look at the actual animal , the object , to understand its volume , to perceive it .
At RISD , you &apos;re not allowed to draw from an image .
And many people ask me , John , couldn &apos;t you just digitize all this ? Make it all digital ? Wouldn &apos;t it be better ?
And I often say , well , there &apos;s something good to how things used to be done . There &apos;s something very different about it , something we should figure out what is good about how we did it , even in this new era .
And I have a good friend , he &apos;s a new media artist named Tota Hasegawa . He &apos;s based in London , no , actually it &apos;s in Tokyo , but when he was based in London , he had a game with his wife . He would go to antique shops , and the game was as such : When we look at an antique we want , we &apos;ll ask the shopkeeper for the story behind the antique , and if it &apos;s a good story , we &apos;ll buy it .
So they &apos;d go to an antique shop , and they &apos;d look at this cup , and they &apos;d say , &quot; Tell us about this cup . &quot;
And the shopkeeper would say , &quot; It &apos;s old . &quot;
&quot; Tell us more . &quot; &quot; Oh , it &apos;s really old . &quot;
And he saw , over and over , the antique &apos;s value was all about it being old .
And as a new media artist , he reflected , and said , you know , I &apos;ve spent my whole career making new media art .
People say , &quot; Wow , your art , what is it ? &quot; It &apos;s new media .
And he realized , it isn &apos;t about old or new .
It &apos;s about something in between .
It isn &apos;t about &quot; old , &quot; the dirt , &quot; new , &quot; the cloud . It &apos;s about what is good .
A combination of the cloud and the dirt is where the action is at .
You see it in all interesting art today , in all interesting businesses today . How we combine those two together to make good is very interesting .
So art makes questions , and leadership is something that is asking a lot of questions .
We aren &apos;t functioning so easily anymore .
We aren &apos;t a simple authoritarian regime anymore .
As an example of authoritarianism , I was in Russia one time traveling in St. Petersburg , at a national monument , and I saw this sign that says , &quot; Do Not Walk On The Grass , &quot; and I thought , oh , I mean , I speak English , and you &apos;re trying to single me out . That &apos;s not fair .
But I found a sign for Russian-speaking people , and it was the best sign ever to say no .
It was like , &quot; No swimming , no hiking , no anything . &quot;
My favorite ones are &quot; no plants . &quot; Why would you bring a plant to a national monument ? I &apos;m not sure .
And also &quot; no love . &quot;
So that is authoritarianism .
And what is that , structurally ?
It &apos;s a hierarchy . We all know that a hierarchy is how we run many systems today , but as we know , it &apos;s been disrupted .
It is now a network instead of a perfect tree .
It &apos;s a heterarchy instead of a hierarchy . And that &apos;s kind of awkward .
And so today , leaders are faced with how to lead differently , I believe .
This is work I did with my colleague Becky Bermont on creative leadership . What can we learn from artists and designers for how to lead ?
Because in many senses , a regular leader loves to avoid mistakes .
Someone who &apos;s creative actually loves to learn from mistakes .
A traditional leader is always wanting to be right , whereas a creative leader hopes to be right .
And this frame is important today , in this complex , ambiguous space , and artists and designers have a lot to teach us , I believe .
And I had a show in London recently where my friends invited me to come to London for four days to sit in a sandbox , and I said great .
And so I sat in a sandbox for four days straight , six hours every day , six-minute appointments with anyone in London , and that was really bad .
But I would listen to people , hear their issues , draw in the sand , try to figure things out , and it was kind of hard to figure out what I was doing .
You know ? It &apos;s all these one-on-one meetings for like four days .
And it felt kind of like being president , actually .
I was like , &quot; Oh , this my job . President . I do a lot of meetings , you know ? &quot;
And by the end of the experience , I realized why I was doing this .
It &apos;s because leaders , what we do is we connect improbable connections and hope something will happen , and in that room I found so many connections between people across all of London , and so leadership , connecting people , is the great question today .
Whether you &apos;re in the hierarchy or the heterarchy , it &apos;s a wonderful design challenge .
And one thing I &apos;ve been doing is doing some research on systems that can combine technology and leadership with an art and design perspective .
Let me show you something I haven &apos;t shown anywhere , actually .
So what this is , is a kind of a sketch , an application sketch I wrote in Python . You know how there &apos;s Photoshop ?
This is called Powershop , and the way it works is imagine an organization . You know , the CEO isn &apos;t ever at the top . The CEO &apos;s at the center of the organization .
There may be different subdivisions in the organization , and you might want to look into different areas . For instance , green are areas doing well , red are areas doing poorly .
You know , how do you , as the leader , scan , connect , make things happen ? So for instance , you might open up a distribution here and find the different subdivisions in there , and know that you know someone in Eco , over here , and these people here are in Eco , the people you might engage with as CEO , people going across the hierarchy .
And part of the challenge of the CEO is to find connections across areas , and so you might look in R &amp; amp ; D , and here you see one person who crosses the two areas of interest , and it &apos;s a person important to engage .
So you might want to , for instance , get a heads-up display on how you &apos;re interacting with them .
How many coffees do you have ?
How often are you calling them , emailing them ?
What is the tenor of their email ? How is it working out ?
Leaders might be able to use these systems to better regulate how they work inside the heterarchy .
You can also imagine using technology like from Luminoso , the guys from Cambridge who were looking at deep text analysis . What is the tenor of your communications ?
So these kind of systems , I believe , are important .
They &apos;re targeted social media systems around leaders .
And I believe that this kind of perspective will only begin to grow as more leaders enter the space of art and design , because art and design lets you think like this , find different systems like this , and I &apos;ve just begun thinking like this , so I &apos;m glad to share that with you .
So in closing , I want to thank all of you for your attention . Thanks very much .
Emiliano Salinas : A civil response to violence
In this passionate talk that &apos;s already caused a sensation in Mexico , Emiliano Salinas , son of former president Carlos Salinas de Gortari , confronts the current climate of violence in Mexico -- or rather , how Mexican society responds to it . He calls on ordinary citizens to move from denial and fear to peaceful , community-based action .
My name is Emiliano Salinas and I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in the violent atmosphere this country is living in right now .
I was born in 1976 .
I grew up in a traditional Mexican family .
As a child , I had a pretty normal life : I would go to school , play with my friends and cousins .
But then my father became President of Mexico and my life changed .
What I &apos;m about to say , at least some of what I &apos;m about to say , will cause controversy .
Firstly , because I &apos;m the one who &apos;s going to say it .
And secondly , because what I &apos;m going to say is true , and it will make a lot of people nervous because it &apos;s something we don &apos;t want to hear .
But it &apos;s imperative that we listen because it &apos;s undeniable and definitive .
It will also make members of criminal organizations nervous for the same reasons .
I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
I know many will find it difficult to separate the fact that I &apos;m Carlos Salinas de Gortari &apos;s son from the fact that I &apos;m a citizen concerned about the country &apos;s current situation .
Don &apos;t worry .
It &apos;s not necessary for understanding the importance of what I &apos;m going to say .
I think we have a problem in Mexico .
We have a big problem .
I think there &apos;s consensus on this .
No one argues -- we all agree there &apos;s a problem .
What we don &apos;t agree on is what the problem actually is .
Is it the Zetas ? The drug traffickers ? The government ?
Corruption ? Poverty ? Or is it something else ?
I think none of these is the problem .
I don &apos;t mean they don &apos;t deserve attention .
But we won &apos;t be able to take care of any of those things if we don &apos;t solve the real problem we have in Mexico first .
The real problem we have is most of us Mexicans , we believe we are victims of our circumstances .
We are a country of victims .
Historically , we &apos;ve always acted as victims of something or somebody .
We were victims of the Spaniards .
Then we were victims of the French .
Then we were victims of Don Porfirio .
Then we were victims of the PRI .
Even of Salinas .
And of El Peje .
And now of the Zetas and the traffickers and the criminals and the kidnappers ...
Hold on ! Wait a minute !
What if none of these things is the problem ?
The problem is not the things we feel victims of .
The problem is that we play the role of victims .
We need to open our eyes and see that we are not victims .
If only we stopped feeling like victims , if we stopped acting as victims , our country would change so much !
I &apos;m going to talk about how to go from a society that acts as a victim of circumstances to a responsible , involved society that takes the future of its country in its own hands .
I &apos;m going to talk about four different levels of civil response against violence , from weakest to strongest .
The first level , the weakest level of civil response against violence , is denial and apathy .
Today , much of Mexican society is in denial of the situation we &apos;re going through .
We want to go on with our daily life even though we are not living under normal circumstances .
Daily life in our country is , to say the least , under extraordinary , exceptional circumstances .
It &apos;s like someone who has a serious illness and pretends it &apos;s the flu and it will just go away .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But it doesn &apos;t .
Mexico has cancer .
And if we don &apos;t do something about it , the cancer will end up killing it .
We need to move Mexican society from denial and apathy to the next level of citizen response , which is , effectively , recognition .
And that recognition will sow fear -- recognizing the seriousness of the situation .
But , fear is better than apathy because fear makes us do something .
Many people in Mexico are afraid today .
We &apos;re very afraid .
And we &apos;re acting out of that fear .
And let me tell you what the problem is with acting out of fear -- and this is the second level of civil response : fear .
Let &apos;s think about Mexican streets : they &apos;re unsafe because of violence , so people stay at home .
Does that make streets more or less safe ?
Less safe !
So streets become more desolate and unsafe , so we stay home more -- which makes streets even more desolate and unsafe , and we stay home even more .
This vicious circle ends up with the whole population stuck inside their houses , scared to death -- even more afraid than when we were out on the streets .
We need to confront this fear .
We need to move Mexican society , the members of society who are at this level , to the next level , which is action .
We need to face our fears and take back our streets , our cities , our neighborhoods .
For many people , acting involves courage .
We go from fear to courage .
They say , &quot; I can &apos;t take it anymore .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
Recently -- this is a sensitive figure -- 35 public lynchings have been recorded so far in 2010 in Mexico .
Usually it &apos;s one or two a year .
Now we &apos;re experiencing one every week .
This shows that society is desperate and it &apos;s taking the law into its own hands .
Unfortunately , violent action -- though action is better than no action -- but taking part in it only disguises violence .
If I &apos;m violent with you and you respond with violence , you become part of the violence and you just disguise my violence .
So civil action is vital , but it &apos;s also vital to take people who are at the level of courage and violent action to the next level , which is non-violent action .
It &apos;s pacific , coordinated civil action , which doesn &apos;t mean passive action .
It means it &apos;s determined and effective , but not violent .
There are examples of this kind of action in Mexico .
Two years ago , in Galena City , Chihuahua , a member of the community was kidnapped , Eric Le Bar√≥n .
His brothers , Benjam√≠n and Juli√°n , got together with the rest of the community to think of the best course of action : to pay the ransom , to take up arms and go after the kidnappers or to ask the government for help .
In the end , Benjam√≠n and Juli√°n decided the best thing they could do was to organize the community and act together .
So what did they do ?
They mobilized the whole community of Le Bar√≥n to go to Chihuahua , where they organized a sit-in in the central park of the city .
They sent a message to the kidnappers : &quot; If you want your ransom come and get it .
We &apos;ll be waiting for you right here . &quot;
They stayed there .
Seven days later , Eric was set free and was able to return home .
This is an example of what an organized society can do , a society that acts .
Of course , criminals can respond .
And in this case , they did .
On July 7th , 2009 , Benjam√≠n Le Bar√≥n was murdered .
But Juli√°n Le Bar√≥n keeps working and he has been mobilizing communities in Chihuahua for over a year .
And for over a year he has known that a price has been put on his head .
But he keeps fighting .
He keeps organizing .
He keeps mobilizing .
These heroic acts are present all over the country .
With a thousand Juli√°ns working together , Mexico would be a very different country .
And they &apos;re out there !
They just have to raise their hands .
I was born in Mexico , I grew up in Mexico and along the way , I learned to love Mexico .
I think anyone who has stepped foot on this land -- not to mention all Mexican people -- will agree that it &apos;s not difficult to love Mexico .
I &apos;ve traveled a lot and nowhere else have I found the passion Mexicans have .
That devotion we feel for the national football team .
That devotion we show in helping victims of disasters , such as the earthquake in 1985 or this year &apos;s floods .
The passion with which we &apos;ve been singing the national anthem since we were kids .
When we thought Masiosare was the strange enemy , and we sang , with a childlike heart , &quot; a soldier in each son . &quot;
I think the biggest insult , the worst way you can offend a Mexican is to insult their mother .
A mother is the most sacred thing in life .
Mexico is our mother and today she cries out for her children .
We are going through the darkest moment in our recent history .
Our mother , Mexico , is being violated before our very eyes .
What are we going to do ?
Masiosare , the strange enemy , is here .
Where is the soldier in each son ?
Mahatma Gandhi , one of the greatest civil fighters of all time , said , &quot; Be the change you wish to see in the world . &quot;
Today in Mexico we &apos;re asking for Gandhis .
We need Ghandis .
We need men and women who love Mexico and who are willing to take action .
This is a call for every true Mexican to join this initiative .
This is a call so that every single thing we love about Mexico -- the festivals , the markets , the restaurants , the cantinas , the tequila , the mariachis , the serenades , the posadas , El Grito , the Day of the Dead , San Miguel , the joy , the passion for life , the fight and everything it means to be Mexican -- doesn &apos;t disappear from this world .
We &apos;re facing a very powerful opponent .
But we are many more .
They can take a man &apos;s life .
Anyone can kill me , or you , or you .
But no one can kill the spirit of true Mexicans .
The battle is won , but we still have to fight it .
2000 years ago , the Roman poet Juvenal said something that today echoes in the heart of every true Mexican .
He said , &quot; Count it the greatest sin to prefer life to honor , and for the sake of living to lose what makes life worth living . &quot;
Thank you .
Evelyn Glennie : How to truly listen
In this soaring demonstration , deaf percussionist Evelyn Glennie illustrates how listening to music involves much more than simply letting sound waves hit your eardrums .
I &apos;m not quite sure whether I really want to see a snare drum at nine o &apos;clock or so in the morning .
But anyway , it &apos;s just great to see such a full theater , and really I must thank Herbie Hancock and his colleagues for such a great presentation .
One of the interesting things , of course , is the combination of that raw hand on the instrument and technology , and of course what he said about listening to our young people .
Of course , my job is all about listening , and my aim , really , is to teach the world to listen .
That &apos;s my only real aim in life .
And it sounds quite simple , but actually it &apos;s quite a big , big job .
Because you know , when you look at a piece of music -- for example , if I just open my little motorbike bag -- we have here , hopefully , a piece of music that is full of little black dots on the page .
And , you know , we open it up and I read the music .
So technically , I can actually read this .
I will follow the instructions , the tempo markings , the dynamics .
I will do exactly as I &apos;m told .
And so therefore , because time is short , if I just play you literally the first maybe two lines or so . It &apos;s very straightforward .
There &apos;s nothing too difficult about the piece .
But here I &apos;m being told that the piece of music is very quick .
I &apos;m being told where to play on the drum .
I &apos;m being told which part of the stick to use .
And I &apos;m being told the dynamic .
And I &apos;m also being told that the drum is without snares .
Snares on , snares off .
So therefore , if I translate this piece of music , we have this idea .
And so on . My career would probably last about five years .
However , what I have to do as a musician is do everything that is not on the music .
Everything that there isn &apos;t time to learn from a teacher , or to talk about , even , from a teacher .
But it &apos;s the things that you notice when you &apos;re not actually with your instrument that in fact become so interesting , and that you want to explore through this tiny , tiny surface of a drum .
So there , we experience the translation . Now we &apos;ll experience the interpretation .
Now my career may last a little longer !
But in a way , you know , it &apos;s the same if I look at you and I see a nice bright young lady with a pink top on .
I see that you &apos;re clutching a teddy bear , etc . , etc .
So I get a basic idea as to what you might be about , what you might like , what you might do as a profession , etc . , etc .
However , that &apos;s just , you know , the initial idea I may have that we all get when we actually look , and we try to interpret , but actually it &apos;s so unbelievably shallow .
In the same way , I look at the music ; I get a basic idea ; I wonder what technically might be hard , or , you know , what I want to do .
Just the basic feeling .
However , that is simply not enough .
And I think what Herbie said -- please listen , listen .
We have to listen to ourselves , first of all .
If I play , for example , holding the stick -- where literally I do not let go of the stick -- you &apos;ll experience quite a lot of shock coming up through the arm .
And you feel really quite -- believe it or not -- detached from the instrument and from the stick , even though I &apos;m actually holding the stick quite tightly .
By holding it tightly , I feel strangely more detached .
If I just simply let go and allow my hand , my arm , to be more of a support system , suddenly I have more dynamic with less effort . Much more .
And I just feel , at last , one with the stick and one with the drum .
And I &apos;m doing far , far less .
So in the same way that I need time with this instrument , I need time with people in order to interpret them .
Not just translate them , but interpret them .
If , for example , I play just a few bars of a piece of music for which I think of myself as a technician -- that is , someone who is basically a percussion player ...
And so on . If I think of myself as a musician ...
And so on . There is a little bit of a difference there that is worth just -- -- thinking about .
And I remember when I was 12 years old , and I started playing tympani and percussion , and my teacher said , &quot; Well , how are we going to do this ? You know , music is about listening . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes , I agree with that . So what &apos;s the problem ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Well , how are you going to hear this ? How are you going to hear that ? &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , how do you hear it ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Well , I think I hear it through here . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Well , I think I do too -- but I also hear it through my hands , through my arms , cheekbones , my scalp , my tummy , my chest , my legs and so on . &quot;
And so we began our lessons every single time tuning drums -- in particular , the kettle drums , or tympani -- to such a narrow pitch interval , so something like ...
that of a difference . Then gradually ... and gradually ...
and it &apos;s amazing that when you do open your body up , and open your hand up to allow the vibration to come through , that in fact the tiny , tiny difference ...
can be felt with just the tiniest part of your finger , there .
And so what we would do is that I would put my hands on the wall of the music room , and together we would &quot; listen &quot; to the sounds of the instruments , and really try to connect with those sounds far , far more broadly than simply depending on the ear .
Because of course , the ear is , I mean , subject to all sorts of things .
The room we happen to be in , the amplification , the quality of the instrument , the type of sticks ... etc . , etc .
They &apos;re all different .
Same amount of weight , but different sound colors .
And that &apos;s basically what we are . We &apos;re just human beings , but we all have our own little sound colors , as it were , that make up these extraordinary personalities and characters and interests and things .
And as I grew older , I then auditioned for the Royal Academy of Music in London , and they said , &quot; Well , no , we won &apos;t accept you , because we haven &apos;t a clue , you know , of the future of a so-called &apos; deaf &apos; musician . &quot;
And I just couldn &apos;t quite accept that .
And so therefore , I said to them , &quot; Well , look , if you refuse -- if you refuse me through those reasons , as opposed to the ability to perform and to understand and love the art of creating sound -- then we have to think very , very hard about the people you do actually accept . &quot;
And as a result -- once we got over a little hurdle , and having to audition twice -- they accepted me . And not only that -- what had happened was that it changed the whole role of the music institutions throughout the United Kingdom .
Under no circumstances were they to refuse any application whatsoever on the basis of whether someone had no arms , no legs -- they could still perhaps play a wind instrument if it was supported on a stand .
No circumstances at all were used to refuse any entry .
And every single entry had to be listened to , experienced and then based on the musical ability -- then that person could either enter or not .
So therefore , this in turn meant that there was an extremely interesting bunch of students who arrived in these various music institutions .
And I have to say , many of them now in the professional orchestras throughout the world .
The interesting thing about this as well , though -- -- is quite simply that not only were people connected with sound -- which is basically all of us , and we well know that music really is our daily medicine .
I say &quot; music , &quot; but actually I mean &quot; sound . &quot;
Because you know , some of the extraordinary things I &apos;ve experienced as a musician , when you may have a 15-year-old lad who has got the most incredible challenges , who may not be able to control his movements , who may be deaf , who may be blind , etc . , etc . -- suddenly , if that young lad sits close to this instrument , and perhaps even lies underneath the marimba , and you play something that &apos;s so incredibly organ-like , almost -- I don &apos;t really have the right sticks , perhaps -- but something like this . Let me change .
Something that &apos;s so unbelievably simple -- but he would be experiencing something that I wouldn &apos;t be , because I &apos;m on top of the sound .
I have the sound coming this way .
He would have the sound coming through the resonators .
If there were no resonators on here , we would have ...
So he would have a fullness of sound that those of you in the front few rows wouldn &apos;t experience , those of you in the back few rows wouldn &apos;t experience either .
Every single one of us , depending on where we &apos;re sitting , will experience this sound quite , quite differently .
And of course , being the participator of the sound , and that is starting from the idea of what type of sound I want to produce -- for example , this sound .
Can you hear anything ?
Exactly . Because I &apos;m not even touching it .
But yet , we get the sensation of something happening .
In the same way that when I see tree moves , then I imagine that tree making a rustling sound .
Do you see what I mean ?
Whatever the eye sees , then there &apos;s always sound happening .
So there &apos;s always , always that huge -- I mean , just this kaleidoscope of things to draw from .
So all of my performances are based on entirely what I experience , and not by learning a piece of music , putting on someone else &apos;s interpretation of it , buying all the CDs possible of that particular piece of music , and so on and so forth .
Because that isn &apos;t giving me enough of something that is so raw and so basic , and something that I can fully experience the journey of .
So it may be that , in certain halls , this dynamic may well work .
It may be that in other halls , they &apos;re simply not going to experience that at all and so therefore , my level of soft , gentle playing may have to be ...
Do you see what I mean ? So , because of this explosion in access to sound , especially through the deaf community , this has not only affected how music institutions , how schools for the deaf treat sound -- and not just as a means of therapy -- although of course , being a participator of music , that definitely is the case as well .
But it &apos;s meant that acousticians have had to really think about the types of halls they put together . There are so few halls in this world that actually have very good acoustics , dare I say . But by that I mean where you can absolutely do anything you imagine .
The tiniest , softest , softest sound to something that is so broad , so huge , so incredible ! There &apos;s always something -- it may sound good up there , may not be so good there .
May be great there , but terrible up there .
Maybe terrible over there , but not too bad there , etc . , etc .
So to find an actual hall is incredible -- for which you can play exactly what you imagine , without it being cosmetically enhanced .
And so therefore , acousticians are actually in conversation with people who are hearing impaired , and who are participators of sound .
And this is quite interesting .
I cannot , you know , give you any detail as far as what is actually happening with those halls , but it &apos;s just the fact that they are going to a group of people for whom so many years we &apos;ve been saying , &quot; Well , how on Earth can they experience music ? You know , they &apos;re deaf . &quot;
We just -- we go like that , and we imagine that that &apos;s what deafness is about .
Or we go like that , and we imagine that &apos;s what blindness is about .
If we see someone in a wheelchair , we assume they cannot walk .
It may be that they can walk three , four , five steps . That , to them , means they can walk .
In a year &apos;s time , it could be two extra steps .
In another year &apos;s time , three extra steps .
Those are hugely important aspects to think about .
So when we do listen to each other , it &apos;s unbelievably important for us to really test our listening skills , to really use our bodies as a resonating chamber , to stop the judgment .
For me , as a musician who deals with 99 percent of new music , it &apos;s very easy for me to say , &quot; Oh yes , I like that piece .
Oh no , I don &apos;t like that piece . &quot; And so on .
And you know , I just find that I have to give those pieces of music real time .
It may be that the chemistry isn &apos;t quite right between myself and that particular piece of music , but that doesn &apos;t mean I have the right to say it &apos;s a bad piece of music .
And you know , it &apos;s just one of the great things about being a musician , is that it is so unbelievably fluid .
So there are no rules , no right , no wrong , this way , that way .
If I asked you to clap -- maybe I can do this .
If I can just say , &quot; Please clap and create the sound of thunder . &quot;
I &apos;m assuming we &apos;ve all experienced thunder .
Now , I don &apos;t mean just the sound ; I mean really listen to that thunder within yourselves .
And please try to create that through your clapping . Try . Just -- please try .
Very good ! Snow . Snow . Have you ever heard snow ?
Audience : No .
Evelyn Glennie : Well then , stop clapping . Try again .
Try again . Snow .
See , you &apos;re awake .
Rain . Not bad . Not bad .
You know , the interesting thing here , though , is that I asked a group of kids not so long ago exactly the same question .
Now -- great imagination , thank you very much .
However , not one of you got out of your seats to think , &quot; Right ! How can I clap ? OK , maybe ...
Maybe I can use my jewelry to create extra sounds .
Maybe I can use the other parts of my body to create extra sounds . &quot;
Not a single one of you thought about clapping in a slightly different way other than sitting in your seats there and using two hands .
In the same way that when we listen to music , we assume that it &apos;s all being fed through here .
This is how we experience music . Of course it &apos;s not .
We experience thunder -- thunder , thunder . Think , think , think .
Listen , listen , listen . Now -- what can we do with thunder ?
I remember my teacher . When I first started , my very first lesson , I was all prepared with sticks , ready to go .
And instead of him saying , &quot; OK , Evelyn , please , feet slightly apart , arms at a more-or-less 90 degree angle , sticks in a more-or-less V shape , keep this amount of space here , etc .
Please keep your back straight , etc . , etc . , etc . &quot; -- where I was probably just going to end up absolutely rigid , frozen , and I would not be able to strike the drum , because I was thinking of so many other things -- he said , &quot; Evelyn , take this drum away for seven days , and I &apos;ll see you next week . &quot;
So , heavens ! What was I to do ? I no longer required the sticks ; I wasn &apos;t allowed to have these sticks .
I had to basically look at this particular drum , see how it was made , what these little lugs did , what the snares did .
Turned it upside down , experimented with the shell , experimented with the head .
Experimented with my body , experimented with jewelry , experimented with all sorts of things .
And of course , I returned with all sorts of bruises and things like that -- but nevertheless , it was such an unbelievable experience , because then , where on Earth are you going to experience that in a piece of music ?
Where on Earth are you going to experience that in a study book ?
So we never , ever dealt with actual study books .
So for example , one of the things that we learn when we are dealing with being a percussion player , as opposed to a musician , is basically straightforward single stroke rolls .
Like that . And then we get a little faster and a little faster and a little faster .
And so on and so forth . What does this piece require ?
Single stroke rolls . So why can &apos;t I then do that whilst learning a piece of music ?
And that &apos;s exactly what he did .
And interestingly , the older I became , and when I became a full-time student at a so called &quot; music institution , &quot; all of that went out of the window .
We had to study from study books .
And constantly , the question , &quot; Well , why ? Why ? What is this relating to ?
I need to play a piece of music . &quot; &quot; Oh , well , this will help your control ! &quot;
&quot; Well , how ? Why do I need to learn that ? I need to relate it to a piece of music .
You know . I need to say something .
&quot; Why am I practicing paradiddles ?
Is it just literally for control , for hand-stick control ? Why am I doing that ?
I need to have the reason , and the reason has to be by saying something through the music . &quot;
And by saying something through music , which basically is sound , we then can reach all sorts of things to all sorts of people .
But I don &apos;t want to take responsibility of your emotional baggage .
That &apos;s up to you , when you walk through a hall .
Because that then determines what and how we listen to certain things .
I may feel sorrowful , or happy , or exhilarated , or angry when I play certain pieces of music , but I &apos;m not necessarily wanting you to feel exactly the same thing .
So please , the next time you go to a concert , just allow your body to open up , allow your body to be this resonating chamber .
Be aware that you &apos;re not going to experience the same thing as the performer is .
The performer is in the worst possible position for the actual sound , because they &apos;re hearing the contact of the stick on the drum , or the mallet on the bit of wood , or the bow on the string , etc . , or the breath that &apos;s creating the sound from wind and brass .
They &apos;re experiencing that rawness there .
But yet they &apos;re experiencing something so unbelievably pure , which is before the sound is actually happening .
Please take note of the life of the sound after the actual initial strike , or breath , is being pulled . Just experience the whole journey of that sound in the same way that I wished I &apos;d experienced the whole journey of this particular conference , rather than just arriving last night .
But I hope maybe we can share one or two things as the day progresses .
But thank you very much for having me !
Adam Sadowsky : How to engineer a viral music video
The band OK Go dreamed up the idea of a massive Rube Goldberg machine for their next music video -- and Adam Sadowsky &apos;s team was charged with building it . He tells the story of the effort and engineering behind their labyrinthine creation that quickly became the YouTube sensation &quot; This Too Shall Pass . &quot; &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
Hi there .
I &apos;m going to be talking a little bit about music , machines and life .
Or , more specifically , what we learned from the creation of a very large and complicated machine for a music video .
Some of you may recognize this image .
This is the opening frame of the video that we created .
We &apos;ll be showing the video at the end , but before we do , I want to talk a little bit about what it is that they wanted .
Now , when we first started talking to OK Go -- the name of the song is &quot; This Too Shall Pass &quot; -- we were really excited because they expressed interest in building a machine that they could dance with .
And we were very excited about this because , of course , they have a history of dancing with machines .
They &apos;re responsible for this video , &quot; Here It Goes Again . &quot;
50-million-plus views on YouTube .
Four guys dancing on treadmills , no cuts , just a static camera .
A fantastically viral and wonderful video .
So we were really excited about working with them .
And we sort of started talking about what it is that they wanted .
And they explained that they wanted kind of a Rube Goldberg machine .
Now , for those of you who don &apos;t know , a Rube Goldberg machine is a complicated contraption , an incredibly over-engineered piece of machinery that accomplishes a relatively simple task .
So we were excited by this idea , and we started talking about exactly what it would look like .
And we came up with some parameters , because , you know , building a Rube Goldberg machine has limitations , but it also is pretty wide open .
And we wanted to make sure that we did something that would work for a music video .
So we came up with a list of requirements , the &quot; 10 commandments , &quot; and they were , in order of ascending difficulty : The first is &quot; No magic . &quot;
Everything that happened on screen had to be very easily understood by a typical viewer .
The rule of thumb was that , if my mother couldn &apos;t understand it , then we couldn &apos;t use it in the video .
They wanted band integration , that is , the machine acting upon the band members , specifically not the other way around .
They wanted the machine action to follow the song feeling .
So as the song picks up emotion , so should the machine get grander in its process .
They wanted us to make use of the space .
So we have this 10,000-square-foot warehouse we were using , divided between two floors .
It included an exterior loading dock .
We used all of that , including a giant hole in the floor that we actually descended the camera and cameraman through .
They wanted it messy , and we were happy to oblige .
The machine itself would start the music .
So the machine would get started , it would travel some distance , reacting along the way , hit play on an iPod or a tape deck or something that would start playback .
And the machine would maintain synchronization throughout .
And speaking of synchronization , they wanted it to sync to the rhythm and to hit specific beats along the way .
Okay .
They wanted it to end precisely on time .
Okay , so now the start to finish timing has to be perfect .
And they wanted the music to drop out at a certain point in the video and actual live audio from the machine to play part of the song .
And as if that wasn &apos;t enough , all of these incredibly complicating things , right , they wanted it in one shot .
Okay .
So , just some statistics about what we went through in the process .
The machine itself has 89 distinct interactions .
It took us 85 takes to get it on film to our satisfaction .
Of those 85 takes , only three actually successfully completed their run .
We destroyed two pianos and 10 televisions in the process .
We went to Home Depot well over a hundred times .
And we lost one high-heeled shoe when one of our engineers , Heather Knight , left her high-heeled shoe -- after a nice dinner , and returned back to the build -- and left it in a pile of stuff .
And another engineer thought , &quot; Well , that would be a really good thing to use &quot; and ended up using it as a really nice trigger .
And it &apos;s actually in the machine .
So what did we learn from all of this ?
Well , having completed this , we have the opportunity to step back and reflect on some of the things .
And we learned that small stuff stinks .
Little balls in wooden tracks are really susceptible to humidity and temperature and a little bit of dust , and they fall out of the tracks , the exact angles makes it hard to get right .
And yet , a bowling ball will always follow the same path .
It doesn &apos;t matter what temperature it is , doesn &apos;t matter what &apos;s in its way ; it will pretty much get where it needs to go .
But as much as the small stuff stinks , we needed somewhere to start , so that we would have somewhere to go .
And so you have to start with it . You have to focus on it .
Small stuff stinks , but , of course , it &apos;s essential , right ?
What else ? Planning is incredibly important .
You know , we spent a lot of time ideating and even building some of these things .
It &apos;s been said that , &quot; No battle plan survives contact with the enemy . &quot;
I think our enemy was physics -- and she &apos;s a cruel mistress .
Often , we had to pull things out as a result because of timing or aesthetics or whatever .
And so while planning is important , so is flexibility .
These are all things that ended up not making it into the final machine .
So also , put reliable stuff last , the stuff that &apos;s going to run every time .
Again , small to large is relevant here .
The little Lego car in the beginning of the video references the big , real car near the end of the video .
The big , real car works every time ; there &apos;s no problem about it .
The little one had a tendency to try to run off the track and that &apos;s a problem .
But you don &apos;t want to have to reset the whole machine because the Lego car at the end doesn &apos;t work , right .
So you put that up front so that , if it fails , at least you know you don &apos;t have to reset the whole thing .
Life can be messy .
There were incredibly difficult moments in the building of this thing .
Months were spent in this tiny , cold warehouse .
And the wonderful elation that we had when we finally completed it .
So it &apos;s important to remember that whether it &apos;s good or it &apos;s bad , &quot; This Too Shall Pass . &quot;
Thank you very much .
And now to introduce their music video , we have OK Go .
OK Go : An introduction . Hello TEDxUSC .
We are OK Go .
What are we doing ? Oh , just hanging out with our Grammy . What what !
It think we can do better than this . Hello TEDxUSC .
We are OK Go . Have you read the &quot; Natural Curiosity Cabinet ? &quot;
I mean , &quot; Curiosity &quot; -- excuse me .
Let me start again .
We need some more ridiculous things besides &quot; The Cabinet of Natural Curiosities . &quot;
Tim &apos;s sundial hat .
Have you seen the new work they &apos;ve done to the Waltz Towers ?
Sorry , start again .
Dogs .
Hello , TEDxUSC . We are OK Go , and this our new video , &quot; This Too Shall Pass . &quot;
&#91; unclear &#93; Kay , we can still do one better I think , yeah .
That one &apos;s pretty good . It &apos;s getting better .
You know you can &apos;t keep letting it get you down And you can &apos;t keep dragging that dead weight around If there ain &apos;t all that much to lug around Better run like hell when you hit the ground When the morning comes When the morning comes You can &apos;t stop these kids from dancing Why would you want to ? Especially when you &apos;re already getting yours Cuz if your mind don &apos;t move and your knees don &apos;t bend Well don &apos;t go blaming the kids again When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes Let it go This too shall pass Let it go This too shall pass You know you can &apos;t keep letting it get you down No , you can &apos;t keep letting it get you down Let it go This too shall pass When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes When the morning comes
James Hansen : Why I must speak out about climate change
Top climate scientist James Hansen tells the story of his involvement in the science of and debate over global climate change . In doing so he outlines the overwhelming evidence that change is happening and why that makes him deeply worried about the future .
What do I know that would cause me , a reticent , Midwestern scientist , to get myself arrested in front of the White House protesting ?
And what would you do if you knew what I know ?
Let &apos;s start with how I got to this point .
I was lucky to grow up at a time when it was not difficult for the child of a tenant farmer to make his way to the state university .
And I was really lucky to go to the University of Iowa where I could study under Professor James Van Allen who built instruments for the first U.S. satellites .
Professor Van Allen told me about observations of Venus , that there was intense microwave radiation .
Did it mean that Venus had an ionosphere ?
Or was Venus extremely hot ?
The right answer , confirmed by the Soviet Venera spacecraft , was that Venus was very hot -- 900 degrees Fahrenheit .
And it was kept hot by a thick carbon dioxide atmosphere .
I was fortunate to join NASA and successfully propose an experiment to fly to Venus .
Our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus , which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid .
But while our instrument was being built , I became involved in calculations of the greenhouse effect here on Earth , because we realized that our atmospheric composition was changing .
Eventually , I resigned as principal investigator on our Venus experiment because a planet changing before our eyes is more interesting and important .
Its changes will affect all of humanity .
The greenhouse effect had been well understood for more than a century .
British physicist John Tyndall , in the 1850 &apos;s , made laboratory measurements of the infrared radiation , which is heat .
And he showed that gasses such as CO2 absorb heat , thus acting like a blanket warming Earth &apos;s surface .
I worked with other scientists to analyze Earth climate observations .
In 1981 , we published an article in Science magazine concluding that observed warming of 0.4 degrees Celsius in the prior century was consistent with the greenhouse effect of increasing CO2 .
That Earth would likely warm in the 1980 &apos;s , and warming would exceed the noise level of random weather by the end of the century .
We also said that the 21st century would see shifting climate zones , creation of drought-prone regions in North America and Asia , erosion of ice sheets , rising sea levels and opening of the fabled Northwest Passage .
All of these impacts or are now well under way .
That paper was reported on the front page of the New York Times and led to me testifying to Congress in the 1980 &apos;s , testimony in which I emphasized that global warming increases both extremes of the Earth &apos;s water cycle .
Heatwaves and droughts on one hand , directly from the warming , but also , because a warmer atmosphere holds more water vapor with its latent energy , rainfall will become in more extreme events .
There will be stronger storms and greater flooding .
Global warming hoopla became time-consuming and distracted me from doing science -- partly because I had complained that the White House altered my testimony .
So I decided to go back to strictly doing science and leave the communication to others .
By 15 years later , evidence of global warming was much stronger .
Most of the things mentioned in our 1981 paper were facts .
I had the privilege to speak twice to the president &apos;s climate task force .
But energy policies continued to focus on finding more fossil fuels .
By then we had two grandchildren , Sophie and Connor .
I decided that I did not want them in the future to say , &quot; Opa understood what was happening , but he didn &apos;t make it clear . &quot;
So I decided to give a public talk criticizing the lack of an appropriate energy policy .
I gave the talk at the University of Iowa in 2004 and at the 2005 meeting of the American Geophysical Union .
This led to calls from the White House to NASA headquarters and I was told that I could not give any talks or speak with the media without prior explicit approval by NASA headquarters .
After I informed the New York Times about these restrictions , NASA was forced to end the censorship .
But there were consequences .
I had been using the first line of the NASA mission statement , &quot; To understand and protect the home planet , &quot; to justify my talks .
Soon the first line of the mission statement was deleted , never to appear again .
Over the next few years I was drawn more and more into trying to communicate the urgency of a change in energy policies , while still researching the physics of climate change .
Let me describe the most important conclusion from the physics -- first , from Earth &apos;s energy balance and , second , from Earth &apos;s climate history .
Adding CO2 to the air is like throwing another blanket on the bed .
It reduces Earth &apos;s heat radiation to space , so there &apos;s a temporary energy imbalance .
More energy is coming in than going out , until Earth warms up enough to again radiate to space as much energy as it absorbs from the Sun .
So the key quantity is Earth &apos;s energy imbalance .
Is there more energy coming in than going out ?
If so , more warming is in the pipeline .
It will occur without adding any more greenhouse gasses .
Now finally , we can measure Earth &apos;s energy imbalance precisely by measuring the heat content in Earth &apos;s heat reservoirs .
The biggest reservoir , the ocean , was the least well measured , until more than 3,000 Argo floats were distributed around the world &apos;s ocean .
These floats reveal that the upper half of the ocean is gaining heat at a substantial rate .
The deep ocean is also gaining heat at a smaller rate , and energy is going into the net melting of ice all around the planet .
And the land , to depths of tens of meters , is also warming .
The total energy imbalance now is about six-tenths of a watt per square meter .
That may not sound like much , but when added up over the whole world , it &apos;s enormous .
It &apos;s about 20 times greater than the rate of energy use by all of humanity .
It &apos;s equivalent to exploding 400,000 Hiroshima atomic bombs per day 365 days per year .
That &apos;s how much extra energy Earth is gaining each day .
This imbalance , if we want to stabilize climate , means that we must reduce CO2 from 391 ppm , parts per million , back to 350 ppm .
That is the change needed to restore energy balance and prevent further warming .
Climate change deniers argue that the Sun is the main cause of climate change .
But the measured energy imbalance occurred during the deepest solar minimum in the record , when the Sun &apos;s energy reaching Earth was least .
Yet , there was more energy coming in than going out .
This shows that the effect of the Sun &apos;s variations on climate is overwhelmed by the increasing greenhouse gasses , mainly from burning fossil fuels .
Now consider Earth &apos;s climate history .
These curves for global temperature , atmospheric CO2 and sea level were derived from ocean cores and Antarctic ice cores , from ocean sediments and snowflakes that piled up year after year over 800,000 years forming a two-mile thick ice sheet .
As you see , there &apos;s a high correlation between temperature , CO2 and sea level .
Careful examination shows that the temperature changes slightly lead the CO2 changes by a few centuries .
Climate change deniers like to use this fact to confuse and trick the public by saying , &quot; Look , the temperature causes CO2 to change , not vice versa . &quot;
But that lag is exactly what is expected .
Small changes in Earth &apos;s orbit that occur over tens to hundreds of thousands of years alter the distribution of sunlight on Earth .
When there is more sunlight at high latitudes in summer , ice sheets melt .
Shrinking ice sheets make the planet darker , so it absorbs more sunlight and becomes warmer .
A warmer ocean releases CO2 , just as a warm Coca-Cola does .
And more CO2 causes more warming .
So CO2 , methane , and ice sheets were feedbacks that amplified global temperature change causing these ancient climate oscillations to be huge , even though the climate change was initiated by a very weak forcing .
The important point is that these same amplifying feedbacks will occur today .
The physics does not change .
As Earth warms , now because of extra CO2 we put in the atmosphere , ice will melt , and CO2 and methane will be released by warming ocean and melting permafrost .
While we can &apos;t say exactly how fast these amplifying feedbacks will occur , it is certain they will occur , unless we stop the warming .
There is evidence that feedbacks are already beginning .
Precise measurements by GRACE , the gravity satellite , reveal that both Greenland and Antarctica are now losing mass , several hundred cubic kilometers per year .
And the rate has accelerated since the measurements began nine years ago .
Methane is also beginning to escape from the permafrost .
What sea level rise can we look forward to ?
The last time CO2 was 390 ppm , today &apos;s value , sea level was higher by at least 15 meters , 50 feet .
Where you are sitting now would be under water .
Most estimates are that , this century , we will get at least one meter .
I think it will be more if we keep burning fossil fuels , perhaps even five meters , which is 18 feet , this century or shortly thereafter .
The important point is that we will have started a process that is out of humanity &apos;s control .
Ice sheets would continue to disintegrate for centuries .
There would be no stable shoreline .
The economic consequences are almost unthinkable .
Hundreds of New Orleans-like devastations around the world .
What may be more reprehensible , if climate denial continues , is extermination of species .
The monarch butterfly could be one of the 20 to 50 percent of all species that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimates will be ticketed for extinction by the end of the century if we stay on business-as-usual fossil fuel use .
Global warming is already affecting people .
The Texas , Oklahoma , Mexico heatwave and drought last year , Moscow the year before and Europe in 2003 , were all exceptional events , more than three standard deviations outside the norm .
Fifty years ago , such anomalies covered only two- to three-tenths of one percent of the land area .
In recent years , because of global warming , they now cover about 10 percent -- an increase by a factor of 25 to 50 .
So we can say with a high degree of confidence that the severe Texas and Moscow heatwaves were not natural ; they were caused by global warming .
An important impact , if global warming continues , will be on the breadbasket of our nation and the world , the Midwest and Great Plains , which are expected to become prone to extreme droughts , worse than the Dust Bowl , within just a few decades , if we let global warming continue .
How did I get dragged deeper and deeper into an attempt to communicate , giving talks in 10 countries , getting arrested , burning up the vacation time that I had accumulated over 30 years ?
More grandchildren helped me along .
Jake is a super-positive , enthusiastic boy .
Here at age two and a half years , he thinks he can protect his two and a half-day-old little sister .
It would be immoral to leave these young people with a climate system spiraling out of control .
Now the tragedy about climate change is that we can solve it with a simple , honest approach of a gradually rising carbon fee collected from fossil fuel companies and distributed 100 percent electronically every month to all legal residents on a per capita basis , with the government not keeping one dime .
Most people would get more in the monthly dividend than they &apos;d pay in increased prices .
This fee and dividend would stimulate the economy and innovations , creating millions of jobs .
It is the principal requirement for moving us rapidly to a clean energy future .
Several top economists are coauthors on this proposition .
Jim DiPeso of Republicans for Environmental Protection describes it thusly : &quot; Transparent . Market-based .
Does not enlarge government .
Leaves energy decisions to individual choices .
Sounds like a conservative climate plan . &quot;
But instead of placing a rising fee on carbon emissions to make fossil fuels pay their true cost to society , our governments are forcing the public to subsidize fossil fuels by 400 to 500 billion dollars per year worldwide , thus encouraging extraction of every fossil fuel -- mountaintop removal , longwall mining , fracking , tar sands , tar shale , deep ocean Arctic drilling .
This path , if continued , guarantees that we will pass tipping points leading to ice sheet disintegration that will accelerate out of control of future generations .
A large fraction of species will be committed to extinction .
And increasing intensity of droughts and floods will severely impact breadbaskets of the world , causing massive famines and economic decline .
Imagine a giant asteroid on a direct collision course with Earth .
That is the equivalent of what we face now .
Yet , we dither , taking no action to divert the asteroid , even though the longer we wait , the more difficult and expensive it becomes .
If we had started in 2005 , it would have required emission reductions of three percent per year to restore planetary energy balance and stabilize climate this century .
If we start next year , it is six percent per year .
If we wait 10 years , it is 15 percent per year -- extremely difficult and expensive , perhaps impossible .
But we aren &apos;t even starting .
So now you know what I know that is moving me to sound this alarm .
Clearly , I haven &apos;t gotten this message across .
The science is clear .
I need your help to communicate the gravity and the urgency of this situation and its solutions more effectively .
We owe it to our children and grandchildren .
Thank you .
Laura Snyder : The Philosophical Breakfast Club
In 1812 , four men at Cambridge University met for breakfast . What began as an impassioned meal grew into a new scientific revolution , in which these men -- who called themselves &quot; natural philosophers &quot; until they later coined &quot; scientist &quot; -- introduced four major principles into scientific inquiry . Historian and philosopher Laura Snyder tells their intriguing story .
I &apos;d like you to come back with me for a moment to the 19th century , specifically to June 24 , 1833 .
The British Association for the Advancement of Science is holding its third meeting at the University of Cambridge .
It &apos;s the first night of the meeting , and a confrontation is about to take place that will change science forever .
An elderly , white-haired man stands up .
The members of the Association are shocked to realize that it &apos;s the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge , who hadn &apos;t even left his house in years until that day .
They &apos;re even more shocked by what he says .
&quot; You must stop calling yourselves natural philosophers . &quot;
Coleridge felt that true philosophers like himself pondered the cosmos from their armchairs .
They were not mucking around in the fossil pits or conducting messy experiments with electrical piles like the members of the British Association .
The crowd grew angry and began to complain loudly .
A young Cambridge scholar named William Whewell stood up and quieted the audience .
He politely agreed that an appropriate name for the members of the association did not exist .
&quot; If &apos; philosophers &apos; is taken to be too wide and lofty a term , &quot; he said , &quot; then , by analogy with &apos; artist , &apos; we may form &apos; scientist . &apos; &quot; This was the first time the word scientist was uttered in public , only 179 years ago .
I first found out about this confrontation when I was in graduate school , and it kind of blew me away .
I mean , how could the word scientist not have existed until 1833 ?
What were scientists called before ?
What had changed to make a new name necessary precisely at that moment ?
Prior to this meeting , those who studied the natural world were talented amateurs .
Think of the country clergyman or squire collecting his beetles or fossils , like Charles Darwin , for example , or , the hired help of a nobleman , like Joseph Priestley , who was the literary companion to the Marquis of Lansdowne when he discovered oxygen .
After this , they were scientists , professionals with a particular scientific method , goals , societies and funding .
Much of this revolution can be traced to four men who met at Cambridge University in 1812 : Charles Babbage , John Herschel , Richard Jones and William Whewell .
These were brilliant , driven men who accomplished amazing things .
Charles Babbage , I think known to most TEDsters , invented the first mechanical calculator and the first prototype of a modern computer .
John Herschel mapped the stars of the southern hemisphere , and , in his spare time , co-invented photography .
I &apos;m sure we could all be that productive without Facebook or Twitter to take up our time .
Richard Jones became an important economist who later influenced Karl Marx .
And Whewell not only coined the term scientist , as well as the words anode , cathode and ion , but spearheaded international big science with his global research on the tides .
In the Cambridge winter of 1812 and 1813 , the four met for what they called philosophical breakfasts .
They talked about science and the need for a new scientific revolution .
They felt science had stagnated since the days of the scientific revolution that had happened in the 17th century .
It was time for a new revolution , which they pledged to bring about , and what &apos;s so amazing about these guys is , not only did they have these grandiose undergraduate dreams , but they actually carried them out , even beyond their wildest dreams .
And I &apos;m going to tell you today about four major changes to science these men made .
About 200 years before , Francis Bacon and then , later , Isaac Newton , had proposed an inductive scientific method .
Now that &apos;s a method that starts from observations and experiments and moves to generalizations about nature called natural laws , which are always subject to revision or rejection should new evidence arise .
However , in 1809 , David Ricardo muddied the waters by arguing that the science of economics should use a different , deductive method .
The problem was that an influential group at Oxford began arguing that because it worked so well in economics , this deductive method ought to be applied to the natural sciences too .
The members of the philosophical breakfast club disagreed .
They wrote books and articles promoting inductive method in all the sciences that were widely read by natural philosophers , university students and members of the public .
Reading one of Herschel &apos;s books was such a watershed moment for Charles Darwin that he would later say , &quot; Scarcely anything in my life made so deep an impression on me .
It made me wish to add my might to the accumulated store of natural knowledge . &quot;
It also shaped Darwin &apos;s scientific method , as well as that used by his peers .
&#91; Science for the public good &#93; Previously , it was believed that scientific knowledge ought to be used for the good of the king or queen , or for one &apos;s own personal gain .
For example , ship captains needed to know information about the tides in order to safely dock at ports .
Harbormasters would gather this knowledge and sell it to the ship captains .
The philosophical breakfast club changed that , working together .
Whewell &apos;s worldwide study of the tides resulted in public tide tables and tidal maps that freely provided the harbormasters &apos; knowledge to all ship captains .
Herschel helped by making tidal observations off the coast of South Africa , and , as he complained to Whewell , he was knocked off the docks during a violent high tide for his trouble .
The four men really helped each other in every way .
They also relentlessly lobbied the British government for the money to build Babbage &apos;s engines because they believed these engines would have a huge practical impact on society .
In the days before pocket calculators , the numbers that most professionals needed -- bankers , insurance agents , ship captains , engineers ‚Äî were to be found in lookup books like this , filled with tables of figures .
These tables were calculated using a fixed procedure over and over by part-time workers known as -- and this is amazing -- computers , but these calculations were really difficult .
I mean , this nautical almanac published the lunar differences for every month of the year .
Each month required 1,365 calculations , so these tables were filled with mistakes .
Babbage &apos;s difference engine was the first mechanical calculator devised to accurately compute any of these tables .
Two models of his engine were built in the last 20 years by a team from the Science Museum of London using his own plans .
This is the one now at the Computer History Museum in California , and it calculates accurately . It actually works .
Later , Babbage &apos;s analytical engine was the first mechanical computer in the modern sense .
It had a separate memory and central processor .
It was capable of iteration , conditional branching and parallel processing , and it was programmable using punched cards , an idea Babbage took from Jacquard &apos;s loom .
Tragically , Babbage &apos;s engines never were built in his day because most people thought that non-human computers would have no usefulness for the public .
&#91; New scientific institutions &#93; Founded in Bacon &apos;s time , the Royal Society of London was the foremost scientific society in England and even in the rest of the world .
By the 19th century , it had become a kind of gentleman &apos;s club populated mainly by antiquarians , literary men and the nobility .
The members of the philosophical breakfast club helped form a number of new scientific societies , including the British Association .
These new societies required that members be active researchers publishing their results .
They reinstated the tradition of the Q &amp; amp ; A after scientific papers were read , which had been discontinued by the Royal Society as being ungentlemanly .
And for the first time , they gave women a foot in the door of science .
Members were encouraged to bring their wives , daughters and sisters to the meetings of the British Association , and while the women were expected to attend only the public lectures and the social events like this one , they began to infiltrate the scientific sessions as well .
The British Association would later be the first of the major national science organizations in the world to admit women as full members .
&#91; External funding for science &#93; Up to the 19th century , natural philosophers were expected to pay for their own equipment and supplies .
Occasionally , there were prizes , such as that given to John Harrison in the 18th century , for solving the so-called longitude problem , but prizes were only given after the fact , when they were given at all .
On the advice of the philosophical breakfast club , the British Association began to use the extra money generated by its meetings to give grants for research in astronomy , the tides , fossil fish , shipbuilding , and many other areas .
These grants not only allowed less wealthy men to conduct research , but they also encouraged thinking outside the box , rather than just trying to solve one pre-set question .
Eventually , the Royal Society and the scientific societies of other countries followed suit , and this has become -- fortunately it &apos;s become -- a major part of the scientific landscape today .
So the philosophical breakfast club helped invent the modern scientist .
That &apos;s the heroic part of their story .
There &apos;s a flip side as well .
They did not foresee at least one consequence of their revolution .
They would have been deeply dismayed by today &apos;s disjunction between science and the rest of culture .
It &apos;s shocking to realize that only 28 percent of American adults have even a very basic level of science literacy , and this was tested by asking simple questions like , &quot; Did humans and dinosaurs inhabit the Earth at the same time ? &quot;
and &quot; What proportion of the Earth is covered in water ? &quot;
Once scientists became members of a professional group , they were slowly walled off from the rest of us .
This is the unintended consequence of the revolution that started with our four friends .
Charles Darwin said , &quot; I sometimes think that general and popular treatises are almost as important for the progress of science as original work . &quot;
In fact , &quot; Origin of Species &quot; was written for a general and popular audience , and was widely read when it first appeared .
Darwin knew what we seem to have forgotten , that science is not only for scientists .
Thank you .
Zach Kaplan + Keith Schacht : Toys and materials from the future
The Inventables guys , Zach Kaplan and Keith Schacht , demo some amazing new materials and how we might use them . Look for squishy magnets , odor-detecting ink , &quot; dry &quot; liquid and a very surprising 10-foot pole .
Zach Kaplan : Keith and I lead a research team .
We investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties . Over the last three years , we found over 200 of these things , and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for TED .
Of these six , the first one that we &apos;re going to talk about is in the black envelope you &apos;re holding .
It comes from a company in Japan called GelTech . Now go ahead and open it up .
Keith Schacht : Now be sure and take the two pieces apart .
What &apos;s unexpected about this is that it &apos;s soft , but it &apos;s also a strong magnet .
Zach and I have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this .
We spent a long time thinking about why this is , and it &apos;s just recently that we realized : it &apos;s when we see something unexpected , it changes our understanding of the way things work .
As you &apos;re seeing this gel magnet for the first time , if you assume that all magnets had to be hard , then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work .
ZK : Now , it &apos;s important to understand what the unexpected properties are .
But to really think about the implications of what this makes possible , we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world .
So , a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors .
If you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it wouldn &apos;t make a loud noise , and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed .
Imagine taking the same material , but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker .
You know , this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door , in your closet , and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf .
For me , I really love this idea .
If you come to my apartment and see my closet , I &apos;m sure you &apos;d figure out why : it &apos;s a mess .
Seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant , what the potential is .
But we &apos;ve found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference .
ZK : It was like six months ago that Keith and I were out in L.A. , and we were at Starbucks having coffee with Roman Coppola .
He works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company , The Directors Bureau .
As we were talking , Roman told us that he &apos;s kind of an inventor on the side .
And we were showing him the same gel magnet that you &apos;re holding in your hand -- and you know , we shared the same ideas . And you could see it in his face : Roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder ; he opens it up and Keith and I look in , and he starts showing us concepts that he &apos;s been working on .
These things just get him really excited . And so we &apos;re looking at these concepts , and we were just like , whoa , this guy &apos;s good .
Because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours . He sold it to you as if it was for sale right now .
When we were going in the car back to the airport , we were thinking : why was this so powerful ?
And as we thought about it more , we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience , just as if you saw it on TV . So , for TED we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future .
Do you have a need for speed ?
Inventables Water Adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast , so tall , that when you hit the bottom , it uses brakes to stop .
Aqua Rocket : coming this summer .
Now , we showed the concept to a few people before this , and they asked us , when &apos;s it coming out ?
So I just wanted to let you know , it &apos;s not actually coming out , just the concept is .
ZK : So now , when we dream up these concepts , it &apos;s important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint .
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work .
This is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial .
The gel that you &apos;re holding would be lining the bottom of the board .
Now this is important for two reasons .
One : the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that , if it were to hit the rider in the head , it wouldn &apos;t injure him .
In addition , you can see from the diagram on the right , the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet .
So this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you &apos;re going down .
The force of the water rushing down , in addition to that repulsion force , would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market .
It &apos;s because of this that you need the magnetic braking system .
When you get to the very bottom of the slide -- -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube .
And I &apos;m going to kick it to Keith to explain why that &apos;s important from a technical standpoint .
So I &apos;m sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal , it &apos;s not a magnetic material . But something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube .
So we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you .
Now , you see the magnet fell really slowly .
Now , I &apos;m not going to get into the physics of it , but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet &apos;s falling , the greater the stopping force .
ZK : Now , our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole , and I have it right here in my pocket .
There &apos;re a few different versions of it .
Some of them automatically unroll like this one .
They can be made to automatically roll up , or they can be made stable , like Zach &apos;s , to hold any position in between .
ZK : As we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these , or how they &apos;re being applied currently -- he was telling us that , in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then , when they &apos;re out on the field , erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base .
In our brainstorms , we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal : so at the end of the game , you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag .
Now , the interesting thing about this is , you don &apos;t have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting .
So we decided to go out onto the streets of Chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this .
I clean my ceiling fans with that and I get the spider webs off my house -- I do it that way .
I &apos;d make my very own walking stick .
I would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree .
An olive server .
Some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use .
I would make a spear that , when you went deep sea diving , you could catch the fish really fast , and then roll it back up , and you could swim easier ... Yeah .
ZK : Now , for our next technology we &apos;re going to do a little demonstration , and so we need a volunteer from the audience .
You sir , come on up .
Come on up . Tell everybody your name .
Steve Jurvetson : Steve .
ZK : It &apos;s Steve . All right Steve , now , follow me .
We need you to stand right in front of the TED sign .
Right there . That &apos;s great .
And hold onto this . Good luck to you .
No , not yet .
ZK : I &apos;d just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by Target .
Little bit -- that &apos;s perfect , just perfect .
Now , Zach , we &apos;re going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future .
So here , come on up to the front . All right , so now if you &apos;ll see here -- no , no , it &apos;s OK .
So , describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt . Go ahead .
SJ : It &apos;s cold .
Now the reason it &apos;s cold is that &apos;s it &apos;s not actually water loaded into these squirt guns -- it &apos;s a dry liquid developed by 3M .
It &apos;s perfectly clear , it &apos;s odorless , it &apos;s colorless .
It &apos;s so safe you could drink this stuff .
And the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water .
All right , well thanks for coming up .
ZK : Wait , wait , Steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends .
SJ : Excellent , thank you .
Thanks for coming up . Let &apos;s give him a big round of applause .
So what &apos;s the significance of this dry liquid ?
Early versions of the fluid were actually used on a Cray Supercomputer .
Now , the unexpected thing about this is that Zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we &apos;d damage the electronics , that we &apos;d get him wet , that we &apos;d hurt the books or the computers . It works because it &apos;s non-conductive .
So you can see here , you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it wouldn &apos;t cause any damage .
You can circulate it to draw the heat away .
But today it &apos;s most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid .
Again , it &apos;s perfectly safe for people . It puts out the fires , doesn &apos;t hurt anything .
But our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game . So during halftime , it could rain down on the players , cool everyone down , and in a matter of minutes it would dry . Wouldn &apos;t hurt the court .
ZK : Our next technology comes to us from a company in Japan called Sekisui Chemical . One of their R &amp; amp ; D engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer .
While he was doing this , he noticed an unexpected thing .
We have a video to show you .
So you see there , it didn &apos;t bounce back . Now , this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing .
It &apos;s technically called , &quot; shape-retaining property . &quot;
Now , think about your interactions with aluminum foil .
Shape-retaining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum foil , and it holds its place . Contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back .
ZK : For example , you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist , but doesn &apos;t use a buckle .
Taking it a little further , if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet , and then you could embed it in a cloth : so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table , so that way on a windy day it wouldn &apos;t blow away .
For our next technology , it &apos;s hard to observe the unexpected property by itself , because it &apos;s an ink .
So , we &apos;ve prepared a video to show it applied to paper .
As this paper is bending , the resistance of the ink changes .
So with simple electronics , you can detect how much the page is being bent .
Now , to think about the potential for this , think of all the places ink is supplied : on business cards , on the back of cereal boxes , board games . Any place you use ink , you could change the way you interact with it .
ZK : So my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book .
This could totally change the way that you interface with paper .
You see the dark line on the side and the top . As you turn the pages of the book , the book can actually detect what page you &apos;re on , based on the curvature of the pages .
In addition , if you were to fold in one of the corners , then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes .
For our last technology , we worked again with Roman and his team at the Directors Bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works .
Old Milk Carton : Oh yeah , it smells good .
Who are you ?
New Milk Carton : I &apos;m New Milk .
OMC : I used to smell like you .
Fresh Watch , from Inventables Dairy Farms .
Packaging that changes color when your milk &apos;s gone off .
Don &apos;t let milk spoil your morning .
ZK : Now , this technology was developed by these two guys : Professor Ken Suslick and Neil Rakow , of the University of Illinois .
Now the way it works : there &apos;s a matrix of color dyes .
And these dyes change color in response to odors .
So the smell of vanilla , that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow . This matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells .
But like in the milk commercial , if you know what odor you want to detect , then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor .
ZK : Right . It was that that started a conversation with Professor Suslick and myself , and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible , beyond just detecting spoiled food . It &apos;s really where the significance of it lies .
His company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn , how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene ?
And he kind of comically explained that time after time , what the firemen would say is : they would rush to the scene of the crime ; they would look around ; if there were no dead policemen , it was OK to go .
I mean , this is a true story . They &apos;re using policemen as canaries .
But more seriously , they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans , and say if it &apos;s safe for the firemen .
In addition , he &apos;s spun off a company from the University called ChemSensing , where they &apos;re working on medical equipment .
So , a patient can come in and actually blow into their device .
By detecting the odor of particular bacteria , or viruses , or even lung cancer , the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results .
This can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients .
Currently , they &apos;re using a method of trial and error , but this could tell you precisely what disease you have .
So that was the six we had for you today , but I hope you &apos;re starting to see why we find these things so fascinating .
Because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world . Prior to seeing this , we would have assumed : a 10-foot pole couldn &apos;t fit in your pocket ; something as inexpensive as ink couldn &apos;t sense the way paper is being bent ; every one of these things -- and we &apos;re constantly trying to find more .
ZK : This is something that Keith and I really enjoy doing .
I &apos;m sure it &apos;s obvious to you now , but it was actually yesterday that I was reminded of why . I was having a conversation with Steve Jurvetson , over downstairs by the escalators , and he was telling me that when Chris sent out that little box , one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand -- the sand that doesn &apos;t get wet . He said that he was playing with it with his son .
And you know , his son was mesmerized , because he would dunk it in the water , he would take it out and it was bone dry . A few weeks later , he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother &apos;s hair , and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair .
And he took the thing and he looked up to Steve and he said , &quot; Look , hydrophobic string . &quot;
I mean , after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me .
Thank you very much .
Thank you .
Rose George : Let &apos;s talk crap . Seriously .
It &apos;s 2013 , yet 2.5 billion people in the world have no access to a basic sanitary toilet . And when there &apos;s no loo , where do you poo ? In the street , probably near your water and food sources -- causing untold death and disease from contamination . Get ready for a blunt , funny , powerful talk from journalist Rose George about a once-unmentionable problem .
Let &apos;s talk dirty .
A few years ago , oddly enough , I needed the bathroom , and I found one , a public bathroom , and I went into the stall , and I prepared to do what I &apos;d done most of my life : use the toilet , flush the toilet , forget about the toilet .
And for some reason that day , instead , I asked myself a question , and it was , where does this stuff go ?
And with that question , I found myself plunged into the world of sanitation -- there &apos;s more coming -- ‚Äî sanitation , toilets and poop , and I have yet to emerge .
And that &apos;s because it &apos;s such an enraging , yet engaging place to be .
To go back to that toilet , it wasn &apos;t a particularly fancy toilet , it wasn &apos;t as nice as this one from the World Toilet Organization .
That &apos;s the other WTO .
But it had a lockable door , it had privacy , it had water , it had soap so I could wash my hands , and I did because I &apos;m a woman , and we do that .
But that day , when I asked that question , I learned something , and that was that I &apos;d grown up thinking that a toilet like that was my right , when in fact it &apos;s a privilege .
2.5 billion people worldwide have no adequate toilet .
They don &apos;t have a bucket or a box .
Forty percent of the world with no adequate toilet .
And they have to do what this little boy is doing by the side of the Mumbai Airport expressway , which is called open defecation , or poo-pooing in the open .
And he does that every day , and every day , probably , that guy in the picture walks on by , because he sees that little boy , but he doesn &apos;t see him .
But he should , because the problem with all that poop lying around is that poop carries passengers .
Fifty communicable diseases like to travel in human shit .
All those things , the eggs , the cysts , the bacteria , the viruses , all those can travel in one gram of human feces .
How ? Well , that little boy will not have washed his hands .
He &apos;s barefoot . He &apos;ll run back into his house , and he will contaminate his drinking water and his food and his environment with whatever diseases he may be carrying by fecal particles that are on his fingers and feet .
In what I call the flushed-and-plumbed world that most of us in this room are lucky to live in , the most common symptoms associated with those diseases , diarrhea , is now a bit of a joke .
It &apos;s the runs , the Hershey squirts , the squits .
Where I come from , we call it Delhi belly , as a legacy of empire .
But if you search for a stock photo of diarrhea in a leading photo image agency , this is the picture that you come up with .
Still not sure about the bikini .
And here &apos;s another image of diarrhea .
This is Marie Saylee , nine months old .
You can &apos;t see her , because she &apos;s buried under that green grass in a little village in Liberia , because she died in three days from diarrhea -- the Hershey squirts , the runs , a joke .
And that &apos;s her dad .
But she wasn &apos;t alone that day , because 4,000 other children died of diarrhea , and they do every day .
Diarrhea is the second biggest killer of children worldwide , and you &apos;ve probably been asked to care about things like HIV / AIDS or T.B. or measles , but diarrhea kills more children than all those three things put together .
It &apos;s a very potent weapon of mass destruction .
And the cost to the world is immense : 260 billion dollars lost every year on the losses to poor sanitation .
These are cholera beds in Haiti .
You &apos;ll have heard of cholera , but we don &apos;t hear about diarrhea .
It gets a fraction of the attention and funding given to any of those other diseases .
But we know how to fix this .
We know , because in the mid-19th century , wonderful Victorian engineers installed systems of sewers and wastewater treatment and the flush toilet , and disease dropped dramatically .
Child mortality dropped by the most it had ever dropped in history .
The flush toilet was voted the best medical advance of the last 200 years by the readers of the British Medical Journal , and they were choosing over the Pill , anesthesia , and surgery .
It &apos;s a wonderful waste disposal device .
But I think that it &apos;s so good ‚Äî it doesn &apos;t smell , we can put it in our house , we can lock it behind a door ‚Äî and I think we &apos;ve locked it out of conversation too .
We don &apos;t have a neutral word for it .
Poop &apos;s not particularly adequate .
Shit offends people . Feces is too medical .
Because I can &apos;t explain otherwise , when I look at the figures , what &apos;s going on .
We know how to solve diarrhea and sanitation , but if you look at the budgets of countries , developing and developed , you &apos;ll think there &apos;s something wrong with the math , because you &apos;ll expect absurdities like Pakistan spending 47 times more on its military than it does on water and sanitation , even though 150,000 children die of diarrhea in Pakistan every year .
But then you look at that already minuscule water and sanitation budget , and 75 to 90 percent of it will go on clean water supply , which is great ; we all need water .
No one &apos;s going to refuse clean water .
But the humble latrine , or flush toilet , reduces disease by twice as much as just putting in clean water .
Think about it . That little boy who &apos;s running back into his house , he may have a nice , clean fresh water supply , but he &apos;s got dirty hands that he &apos;s going to contaminate his water supply with .
And I think that the real waste of human waste is that we are wasting it as a resource and as an incredible trigger for development , because these are a few things that toilets and poop itself can do for us .
So a toilet can put a girl back in school .
Twenty-five percent of girls in India drop out of school because they have no adequate sanitation .
They &apos;ve been used to sitting through lessons for years and years holding it in .
We &apos;ve all done that , but they do it every day , and when they hit puberty and they start menstruating , it just gets too much .
And I understand that . Who can blame them ?
So if you met an educationalist and said , &quot; I can improve education attendance rates by 25 percent with just one simple thing , &quot; you &apos;d make a lot of friends in education .
That &apos;s not the only thing it can do for you .
Poop can cook your dinner .
It &apos;s got nutrients in it .
We ingest nutrients . We excrete nutrients as well .
We don &apos;t keep them all .
75 percent of their cooking fuel in their prison system from the contents of prisoners &apos; bowels .
So these are a bunch of inmates in a prison in Butare .
They &apos;re genocidal inmates , most of them , and they &apos;re stirring the contents of their own latrines , because if you put poop in a sealed environment , in a tank , pretty much like a stomach , then , pretty much like a stomach , it gives off gas , and you can cook with it .
And you might think it &apos;s just good karma to see these guys stirring shit , but it &apos;s also good economic sense , because they &apos;re saving a million dollars a year .
They &apos;re cutting down on deforestation , and they &apos;ve found a fuel supply that is inexhaustible , infinite and free at the point of production .
It &apos;s not just in the poor world that poop can save lives .
Here &apos;s a woman who &apos;s about to get a dose of the brown stuff in those syringes , which is what you think it is , except not quite , because it &apos;s actually donated .
There is now a new career path called stool donor .
It &apos;s like the new sperm donor .
Because she has been suffering from a superbug called C. diff , and it &apos;s resistant to antibiotics in many cases .
She &apos;s been suffering for years .
She gets a dose of healthy human feces , and the cure rate for this procedure is 94 percent .
It &apos;s astonishing , but hardly anyone is still doing it .
Maybe it &apos;s the ick factor .
That &apos;s okay , because there &apos;s a team of research scientists in Canada who have now created a stool sample , a fake stool sample which is called RePOOPulate .
So you &apos;d be thinking by now , okay , the solution &apos;s simple , we give everyone a toilet .
And this is where it gets really interesting , because it &apos;s not that simple , because we are not simple .
So the really interesting , exciting work -- this is the engaging bit -- in sanitation is that we need to understand human psychology .
We need to understand software as well as just giving someone hardware .
They &apos;ve found in many developing countries that governments have gone in and given out free latrines and gone back a few years later and found that they &apos;ve got lots of new goat sheds or temples or spare rooms with their owners happily walking past them and going over to the open defecating ground .
So the idea is to manipulate human emotion .
It &apos;s been done for decades . The soap companies did it in the early 20th century .
They tried selling soap as healthy . No one bought it .
They tried selling it as sexy . Everyone bought it .
In India now there &apos;s a campaign which persuades young brides not to marry into families that don &apos;t have a toilet .
It &apos;s called &quot; No Loo , No I Do . &quot;
And in case you think that poster &apos;s just propaganda , here &apos;s Priyanka , 23 years old .
I met her last October in India , and she grew up in a conservative environment .
She grew up in a rural village in a poor area of India , and she was engaged at 14 , and then at 21 or so , she moved into her in-law &apos;s house .
And she was horrified to get there and find that they didn &apos;t have a toilet .
She &apos;d grown up with a latrine .
It was no big deal , but it was a latrine .
And the first night she was there , she was told that at 4 o &apos;clock in the morning -- her mother-in-law got her up , told her to go outside and go and do it in the dark in the open .
And she was scared . She was scared of drunks hanging around .
She was scared of snakes . She was scared of rape .
After three days , she did an unthinkable thing .
She left .
And if you know anything about rural India , you &apos;ll know that &apos;s an unspeakably courageous thing to do .
But not just that .
She got her toilet , and now she goes around all the other villages in India persuading other women to do the same thing .
It &apos;s what I call social contagion , and it &apos;s really powerful and really exciting .
Another version of this , another village in India near where Priyanka lives is this village , called Lakara , and about a year ago , it had no toilets whatsoever .
Kids were dying of diarrhea and cholera .
Some visitors came , using various behavioral change tricks like putting out a plate of food and a plate of shit and watching the flies go one to the other .
Somehow , people who &apos;d been thinking that what they were doing was not disgusting at all suddenly thought , &quot; Oops . &quot;
Not only that , but they were ingesting their neighbors &apos; shit .
That &apos;s what really made them change their behavior .
So this woman , this boy &apos;s mother installed this latrine in a few hours .
Her entire life , she &apos;d been using the banana field behind , but she installed the latrine in a few hours .
It cost nothing . It &apos;s going to save that boy &apos;s life .
So when I get despondent about the state of sanitation , even though these are pretty exciting times because we &apos;ve got the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation reinventing the toilet , which is great , we &apos;ve got Matt Damon going on bathroom strike , which is great for humanity , very bad for his colon .
But there are things to worry about .
It &apos;s the most off-track Millennium Development Goal .
It &apos;s about 50 or so years off track .
We &apos;re not going to meet targets , providing people with sanitation at this rate .
So when I get sad about sanitation , I think of Japan , because Japan 70 years ago was a nation of people who used pit latrines and wiped with sticks , and now it &apos;s a nation of what are called Woshurettos , washlet toilets .
They have in-built bidet nozzles for a lovely , hands-free cleaning experience , and they have various other features like a heated seat and an automatic lid-raising device which is known as the &quot; marriage-saver . &quot;
But most importantly , what they have done in Japan , which I find so inspirational , is they &apos;ve brought the toilet out from behind the locked door .
They &apos;ve made it conversational .
People go out and upgrade their toilet .
They talk about it . They &apos;ve sanitized it .
I hope that we can do that . It &apos;s not a difficult thing to do .
All we really need to do is look at this issue as the urgent , shameful issue that it is .
And don &apos;t think that it &apos;s just in the poor world that things are wrong .
Our sewers are crumbling .
Things are going wrong here too .
The solution to all of this is pretty easy .
I &apos;m going to make your lives easy this afternoon and just ask you to do one thing , and that &apos;s to go out , protest , speak about the unspeakable , and talk shit .
Thank you .
Frank Gehry : My days as a young rebel
Before he was a legend , architect Frank Gehry takes a whistlestop tour of his early work , from his house in Venice Beach to the American Center in Paris , which was under construction when he gave this talk .
I &apos;m going to go right into the slides .
And all I &apos;m going to try and prove to you with these slides is that I do just very straight stuff .
And my ideas are -- in my head , anyway -- they &apos;re very logical and relate to what &apos;s going on and problem solving for clients .
I either convince clients at the end that I solve their problems , or I really do solve their problems , because usually they seem to like it .
Let me go right into the slides .
Can you turn off the light ? Down .
I like to be in the dark .
I don &apos;t want you to see what I &apos;m doing up here .
Anyway , I did this house in Santa Monica , and it got a lot of notoriety .
In fact , it appeared in a porno comic book , which is the slide on the right .
This is in Venice .
I just show it because I want you to know I &apos;m concerned about context .
On the left-hand side , I had the context of those little houses , and I tried to build a building that fit into that context .
When people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird , and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they &apos;re photographed or seen in that space .
And then , once I deal with the context , I then try to make a place that &apos;s comfortable and private and fairly serene , as I hope you &apos;ll find that slide on the right .
And then I did a law school for Loyola in downtown L.A.
I was concerned about making a place for the study of law .
And we continue to work with this client .
The building on the right at the top is now under construction .
The garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down , finally , and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we &apos;ve created , this campus .
And it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place .
They wanted a sense of place .
And so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown , in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into .
And it was my theory , or my point of view , that one didn &apos;t upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations .
I tried to be inclusive , to include the buildings in the neighborhood , whether they were buildings I liked or not .
In the &apos; 60s I started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in Bloomingdale &apos;s .
We even made flooring , walls and everything , out of cardboard .
And the success of it threw me for a loop .
I couldn &apos;t deal with the success of furniture -- I wasn &apos;t secure enough as an architect -- and so I closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like .
So , nobody would like this .
And it was in this , preliminary to these pieces of furniture , that Ricky and I worked on furniture by the slice .
And after we failed , I just kept failing .
The piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket .
And I put a piece of tape around it , as you see there , and realized you could sit on it , and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on .
So , it was an accidental discovery .
I got into fish .
I mean , the story I tell is that I got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man , and if you &apos;re going to go back , we might as well go back to the beginning .
And so I started making these funny things .
And they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the Walker .
And then , I sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what I was learning about the form of the fish and the movement .
And a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental , again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing , and I just kept going with it , and made this proposal for a building , which was only a proposal .
I did this building in Japan .
I was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed .
And I love sake and Kobe and all that stuff .
And after I got -- I was really drunk -- I was asked to do some sketches on napkins .
And I made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and Morandi-like things that I used to do .
And the client said , &quot; Why no fish ? &quot;
And so I made a drawing with a fish , and I left Japan .
Three weeks later , I received a complete set of drawings saying we &apos;d won the competition .
Now , it &apos;s hard to do . It &apos;s hard to translate a fish form , because they &apos;re so beautiful -- perfect -- into a building or object like this .
And Oldenburg , who I work with a little once in a while , told me I couldn &apos;t do it , and so that made it even more exciting .
But he was right -- I couldn &apos;t do the tail .
I started to get the head OK , but the tail I couldn &apos;t do .
It was pretty hard .
The thing on the right is a snake form , a ziggurat .
And I put them together , and you walk between them .
It was a dialog with the context again .
Now , if you saw a picture of this as it was published in Architectural Record -- they didn &apos;t show the context , so you would think , &quot; God , what a pushy guy this is . &quot;
But a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant .
Couldn &apos;t find it .
So ...
As for craft and technology and all those things that you &apos;ve all been talking about , I was thrown for a complete loop .
This was built in six months .
The way we sent drawings to Japan : we used the magic computer in Michigan that does carved models , and we used to make foam models , which that thing scanned .
We made the drawings of the fish and the scales .
And when I got there , everything was perfect -- except the tail .
So , I decided to cut off the head and the tail .
And I made the object on the left for my show at the Walker .
And it &apos;s one of the nicest pieces I &apos;ve ever made , I think .
And then Jay Chiat , a friend and client , asked me to do his headquarters building in L.A.
For reasons we don &apos;t want to talk about , it got delayed .
Toxic waste , I guess , is the key clue to that one .
And so we built a temporary building -- I &apos;m getting good at temporary -- and we put a conference room in that &apos;s a fish .
And , finally , Jay dragged me to my hometown , Toronto , Canada .
And there is a story -- it &apos;s a real story -- about my grandmother buying a carp on Thursday , bringing it home , putting it in the bathtub when I was a kid .
I played with it in the evening .
When I went to sleep , the next day it wasn &apos;t there .
And the next night , we had gefilte fish .
And so I set up this interior for Jay &apos;s offices and I made a pedestal for a sculpture .
And he didn &apos;t buy a sculpture , so I made one .
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother &apos;s , and I put the fish in .
It was a joke .
I play with funny people like &#91; Claes &#93; Oldenburg .
We &apos;ve been friends for a long time .
And we &apos;ve started to work on things .
A few years ago , we did a performance piece in Venice , Italy , called &quot; Il Corso del Coltello &quot; -- the Swiss Army knife .
And most of the imagery is -- Claes &apos; , but those two little boys are my sons , and they were Claes &apos; assistants in the play .
He was the Swiss Army knife .
He was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter , and I was Frankie P. Toronto .
P for Palladio .
Dressed up like the AT &amp; amp ; T building by Claes -- with a fish hat .
The highlight of the performance was at the end .
This beautiful object , the Swiss Army knife , which I get credit for participating in .
And I can tell you -- it &apos;s totally an Oldenburg .
I had nothing to do with it .
The only thing I did was , I made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal , because I love sailing .
We made it into a sailing craft .
I &apos;ve been known to mess with things like chain link fencing .
I do it because it &apos;s a curious thing in the culture , when things are made in such great quantities , absorbed in such great quantities , and there &apos;s so much denial about them .
People hate it .
And I &apos;m fascinated with that , which , like the paper furniture -- it &apos;s one of those materials .
And I &apos;m always drawn to that .
And so I did a lot of dirty things with chain link , which nobody will forgive me for .
But Claes made homage to it in the Loyola Law School .
And that chain link is really expensive .
It &apos;s in perspective and everything .
And then we did a camp together for children with cancer .
And you can see , we started making a building together .
Of course , the milk can is his .
But we were trying to collide our ideas , to put objects next to each other .
Like a Morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life .
And it seemed to work as a way to put he and I together .
Then Jay Chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in Venice , and I started with this three-piece thing , and you entered in the middle .
And Jay asked me what I was going to do with the piece in the middle .
And he pushed that .
And one day I had a -- oh , well , the other way .
I had the binoculars from Claes , and I put them there , and I could never get rid of them after that .
Oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal .
It made my building look sick .
And it was this interaction between that kind of , up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting .
It led to the building on the left .
And I still think the Time magazine picture will be of the binoculars , you know , leaving out the -- what the hell .
I use a lot of metal in my work , and I have a hard time connecting with the craft .
The whole thing about my house , the whole use of rough carpentry and everything , was the frustration with the crafts available .
I said , &quot; If I can &apos;t get the craft that I want , I &apos;ll use the craft I can get . &quot;
There were plenty of models for that , in Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns , and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials .
I went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture .
And it was all of one material , and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls .
The metalworkers , for the most part , do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff .
I was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers &apos; unions of America and Canada in Washington , and I did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings , etc. etc .
And it &apos;s working very well to have these people , these craftsmen , interested in it .
I just tell the stories .
It &apos;s a way of connecting , at least , with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture .
The metal continued into a building -- Herman Miller , in Sacramento .
And it &apos;s just a complex of factory buildings .
And Herman Miller has this philosophy of having a place -- a people place .
I mean , it &apos;s kind of a trite thing to say , but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be , where the people would come and where the people working would interact .
So it &apos;s out in the middle of nowhere , and you approach it .
It &apos;s copper and galvanize .
I used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge , so it would buckle .
I spent a lot of time undoing Richard Meier &apos;s aesthetic .
Everybody &apos;s trying to get the panels perfect , and I always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy .
And they end up looking like stone .
This is the central area .
There &apos;s a ramp .
And that little dome in there is a building by Stanley Tigerman .
Stanley was instrumental in my getting this job .
And when I was awarded the contract I , at the very beginning , asked the client if they would let Stanley do a cameo piece with me .
Because these were ideas that we were talking about , building things next to each other , making -- it &apos;s all about &#91; a &#93; metaphor for a city , maybe .
And so Stanley did the little dome thing .
And we did it over the phone and by fax .
He would send me a fax and show me something .
He &apos;d made a building with a dome and he had a little tower .
I told him , &quot; No , no , that &apos;s too ongepotchket .
I don &apos;t want the tower . &quot;
So he came back with a simpler building , but he put some funny details on it , and he moved it closer to my building .
And so I decided to put him in a depression .
I put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in .
And so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax , going back and forth over a couple of weeks &apos; period .
And he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it .
And so then I put this big billboard behind it .
And I call it , &quot; David and Goliath . &quot;
And that &apos;s my cafeteria .
In Boston , we had that old building on the left .
It was a very prominent building off the freeway , and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of -- I thought -- the language of the neighborhood , which had these cornices , projecting cornices .
Mine got a little exuberant , but I used lead copper , which is a beautiful material , and it turns green in 100 years .
Instead of , like , copper in 10 or 15 .
We redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space .
And it surprised both Boston and myself that we got it approved , because they have very strict kind of design guideline , and they wouldn &apos;t normally think I would fit them .
The detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building .
In Barcelona , on Las Ramblas for some film festival , I did the Hollywood sign going and coming , made a building out of it , and they built it .
I flew in one night and took this picture .
But they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me .
And then more metal and some chain link in Santa Monica -- a little shopping center .
And this is a laser laboratory at the University of Iowa , in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back .
It &apos;s the support labs , which , by some coincidence , required no windows .
And the shape fit perfectly .
I just joined the points .
In the curved part there &apos;s all the mechanical equipment .
That solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon -- and so it was an opportunity that I seized , because I didn &apos;t have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form .
It gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it .
This is a small house somewhere .
They &apos;ve been building it so long I don &apos;t remember where it is .
It &apos;s in the West Valley .
And we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake .
These are the models .
The reality , with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad .
And it reminded me why I play defensively in things like my house .
When you have to do something really cheaply , it &apos;s hard to get perfect corners and stuff .
That big metal thing is a passage , and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom , which is on the right .
It &apos;s kind of like a whole built town .
I was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at Yale .
I thought it was fitting for me to be doing that .
This is a house next to a Philip Johnson house in Minnesota .
The owners had a dilemma -- they asked Philip to do it .
He was too busy .
He didn &apos;t recommend me , by the way .
We ended up having to make it a sculpture , because the dilemma was , how do you build a building that doesn &apos;t look like the language ?
Is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided ?
Etc. etc .
You &apos;ve got the idea .
And so we finally ended up making it .
These people are art collectors .
And we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side .
And the building is very sculptural as you walk around it .
It &apos;s made of metal and the brown stuff is Fin-Ply -- it &apos;s that formed lumber from Finland .
We used it at Loyola on the chapel , and it didn &apos;t work .
I keep trying to make it work .
In this case we learned how to detail it .
In Cleveland , there &apos;s Burnham Mall , on the left .
It &apos;s never been finished .
Going out to the lake , you can see all those new buildings we built .
And we had the opportunity to build a building on this site .
There &apos;s a railroad track .
This is the city hall over here somewhere , and the courthouse .
And the centerline of the mall goes out .
Burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built , and so we followed .
Sohio is on the axis here , and we followed the axis , and they &apos;re two kind of goalposts .
And this is our building , which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company .
We collaborated with Oldenburg and put the newspaper on top , folded .
The health club is fastened to the garage with a C-clamp , for Cleveland .
You drive down .
So it &apos;s about a 10-story C-clamp .
And all this stuff at the bottom is a museum , and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry .
This owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries .
And this would be a hotel .
So , the centerline of this thing -- we &apos;d preserve it , and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by Pelli and Kohn Pederson Fox , etc . , that are underway .
It &apos;s hard to do high-rise .
I feel much more comfortable down here .
This is a piece of property in Brentwood .
And a long time ago , about &apos; 82 or something , after my house -- I designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left .
And she came back , I guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site .
And following that basic idea of the village , we changed it as we got into it .
I locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall , creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom , which I designed like a kind of a barge , looking like a boat .
And that &apos;s it , built .
The dome was a request from the client .
She wanted a dome somewhere in the house .
She didn &apos;t care where .
When you sleep in this bedroom , I hope -- I mean , I haven &apos;t slept in it yet .
I &apos;ve offered to marry her so I could sleep there , but she said I didn &apos;t have to do that .
But when you &apos;re in that room , you feel like you &apos;re on a kind of barge on some kind of lake .
And it &apos;s very private .
The landscape is being built around to create a private garden .
And then up above there &apos;s a garden on this side of the living room , and one on the other side .
These aren &apos;t focused very well .
I don &apos;t know how to do it from here .
Focus the one on the right .
It &apos;s up there .
Left -- it &apos;s my right .
Anyway , you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees .
That &apos;s the living room .
Servants &apos; quarters .
A guest bedroom , which has this dome with marble on it .
And then you enter into the living room and then so on .
This is the bedroom .
You come down from this level along the stairway , and you enter the bedroom here , going into the lake .
And the bed is back in this space , with windows looking out onto the lake .
These Stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot .
The material is lead copper , like in the building in Boston .
And so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it &apos;s 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it .
And this happened by accident that I got this right on axis with the dining room table .
It looks like I got a Baldessari painting for free .
But the idea is , the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside .
Eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up -- and it will be very private .
And you feel like you &apos;re in your own kind of village .
This is for Michael Eisner -- Disney .
We &apos;re doing some work for him .
And this is in Anaheim , California , and it &apos;s a freeway building .
You go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour , and there &apos;s another bridge here .
And you &apos;re through this room in a split second , and the building will sort of reflect that .
On the backside , it &apos;s much more humane -- entrance , dining hall , etc .
And then this thing here -- I &apos;m hoping as you drive by you &apos;ll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it .
Kind of a fun thing to do .
I &apos;m doing a building in Switzerland , Basel , which is an office building for a furniture company .
And we struggled with the image .
These are the early studies , but they have to sell furniture to normal people , so if I did the building and it was too fancy , then people might say , &quot; Well , the furniture looks OK in his thing , but no , it ain &apos;t going to look good in my normal building . &quot;
So we &apos;ve made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here , and we &apos;ve taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate .
And you &apos;re looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces .
This is in Paris , along the Seine .
Palais des Sports , the Gare de Lyon over here .
The Minister of Finance -- the guy that moved from the Louvre -- goes in here .
There &apos;s a new library across the river .
And back in here , in this already treed park , we &apos;re doing a very dense building called the American Center , which has a theater , apartments , dance school , an art museum , restaurants and all kinds of -- it &apos;s a very dense program -- bookstores , etc .
In a very tight , small -- this is the ground level .
And the French have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off .
They call it the plan coupe .
And I struggled with that thing -- how to get around the corner .
These are the models for it .
I showed you the other model , the one -- this is the way I organized myself so I could make the drawing -- so I understood the problem .
I was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it ?
Apartments , etc .
And these are the kind of study models we did .
And the one on the left is pretty awful .
You can see why I was ready to commit suicide when this one was built .
But out of it came finally this resolution , where the elevator piece worked frontally to this , parallel to this street , and also parallel to here .
And then this kind of twist , with this balcony and the skirt , kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer .
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc .
So it would all be built in stone , in French limestone , except for this metal piece .
And it faces into a park .
And the idea was to make this express the energy of this .
On the side facing the street it &apos;s much more normal , except I slipped a few mansards down , so that coming on the point , these housing units made a gesture to the corner .
And this will be some kind of high-tech billboard .
If any of you guys have any ideas for it , please contact me .
I don &apos;t know what to do .
Jay Chiat is a glutton for punishment , and he hired me to do a house for him in the Hamptons .
And it &apos;s got a fish .
And I keep thinking , &quot; This is going to be the last fish . &quot;
It &apos;s like a drug addict .
I say , &quot; I &apos;m not going to do it anymore -- I don &apos;t want to do it anymore -- I &apos;m not going to do it . &quot;
And then I do it .
There it is .
But it &apos;s the living room .
And this piece here is -- I don &apos;t know what it is .
I just added it so that we &apos;d have enough money in the budget so we could take something out .
This is Euro Disney , and I &apos;ve worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier .
We &apos;ve had a lot of fun working together .
I think I &apos;m from Mars for them , and they are for me , but somehow we all manage to work together , and I think , productively .
So far .
This is a shopping thing .
You come into the Magic Kingdom and the hotel that Tony Baxter &apos;s group is doing out here .
And then this is a kind of a shopping mall , with a rodeo and restaurants .
And another restaurant .
What I did -- because of the Paris skies being quite dull , I made a light grid that &apos;s perpendicular to the train station , to the route of the train .
It looks like it &apos;s kind of been there , and then crashed all these simpler forms into it .
The light grid will have a light , be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling .
In Switzerland -- Germany , actually -- on the Rhine across from Basel , we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum .
And I tried to -- there &apos;s a Nick Grimshaw building over here , there &apos;s an Oldenburg sculpture over here -- I tried to make a relationship urbanistically .
And I don &apos;t gave good slides to show -- it &apos;s just been completed -- but this piece here is this building , and these pieces here and here .
And as you pass by it &apos;s always part -- you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood .
It &apos;s plaster and just zinc .
And you wonder , if this is a museum , what it &apos;s going to be like inside ?
If it &apos;s going to be so busy and crazy that you wouldn &apos;t show anything , and just wait .
I &apos;m so cunning and clever -- I made it quiet and wonderful .
But on the outside it does scream out at you a bit .
It &apos;s actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff .
And from the building in the back , you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills .
I know I &apos;m over time .
See , that skylight goes down and becomes that one .
So it &apos;s pretty quiet inside .
This is the Disney Hall -- the concert hall .
It &apos;s a complicated project .
It has a chamber hall .
It &apos;s related to an existing Chandler Pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring .
And it &apos;s not a great building , but I approached it optimistically , that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us .
And the plan of this -- it &apos;s a concert hall .
This is the foyer , which is kind of a garden structure .
There &apos;s commercial at the ground floor .
These are offices , which , really , in the competition , we didn &apos;t have to design .
But finally , there &apos;s a hotel there .
These were the kind of relationships made to the Chandler , composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed -- to MOCA , etc .
The acoustician in the competition gave us criteria , which led to this compartmentalized scheme , which we found out after the competition would not work at all .
But everybody liked these forms and liked the space , and so that &apos;s one of the problems of a competition .
You have to then try and get that back in some way .
And we studied many models .
This was our original model .
These were the three buildings that were the ideal -- the Concertgebouw , Boston and Berlin .
Everybody liked the surround .
Actually , this is the smallest hall in size , and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies .
Our client doesn &apos;t want balconies , so -- and when we met our new acoustician , he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape .
And we tried many shapes , trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical , acceptable format .
We finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the Concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls , which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they weren &apos;t , but now we have them .
And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room .
That &apos;s the idea .
And the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural .
And the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit , and create intimacy .
Now , this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being -- and so I wouldn &apos;t take it literally , except the feeling of the space .
We studied the acoustics with laser stuff , and they bounce them off this and see where it all works .
But you get the sense of the hall in section .
Most halls come straight down into a proscenium .
In this case we &apos;re opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners .
And so it will be quite a different shape .
The original building , because it was frog-like , fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well .
When you get into a box , it &apos;s harder to do it -- and here we are , struggling with how to put the hotel in .
And this is a teapot I designed for Alessi .
I just stuck it on there .
But this is how I do work . I do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away .
And of course it &apos;s not going to look like that , but it is the crazy way I tend to work .
And then finally , in L.A. I was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of Interstate Bank Tower , the highest building in L.A.
Larry Halprin is doing the stairs .
And I was asked to do a fish , and so I did a snake .
It &apos;s a public space , and I made it kind of a garden structure , and you can go in it .
It &apos;s a kiva , and Larry &apos;s putting some water in there , and it works much better than a fish .
In Barcelona I was asked to do a fish , and we &apos;re working on that , at the foot of a Ritz-Carlton Tower being done by Skidmore , Owings and Merrill .
And the Ritz-Carlton Tower is being designed with exposed steel , non-fire proof , much like those old gas tanks .
And so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it , perverted it , into the form of the fish , and created a kind of a 19th-century contraption that looks like , that will sit -- this is the beach and the harbor out in front , and this is really a shopping center with department stores .
And we split these bridges .
Originally , this was all solid with a hole in it .
We cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel .
We showed this to the hotel people the other day , and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the Ritz-Carlton anymore , because of this fish .
And finally , I just threw these in -- Lou Danziger .
I didn &apos;t expect Lou Danziger to be here , but this is a building I did for him in 1964 , I think .
A little studio -- and it &apos;s sadly for sale .
Time goes on .
And this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing .
He designed the robot as the cashier , and the head moves , and I did the rest of it .
And the food wasn &apos;t as good as the stuff , and so it failed .
It should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first .
It didn &apos;t work .
Thank you very much .
Nicholas Negroponte : Taking OLPC to Colombia
TED follows Nicholas Negroponte to Colombia as he delivers laptops inside territory once controlled by guerrillas . His partner ? Colombia &apos;s Defense Department , who see One Laptop per Child as an investment in the region .
It &apos;s amazing , when you meet a head of state and you say , &quot; What is your most precious natural resource ? &quot; -- they will not say children at first .
And then when you say children , they will pretty quickly agree with you .
: We &apos;re traveling today with the Minister of Defense of Colombia , head of the army and the head of the police , and we &apos;re dropping off 650 laptops today to children who have no television , no telephone and have been in a community cut off from the rest of the world for the past 40 years .
The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC , the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement .
There are one billion children in the world , and 50 percent of them don &apos;t have electricity at home or at school .
And in some countries -- let me pick Afghanistan -- 75 percent of the little girls don &apos;t go to school .
And I don &apos;t mean that they drop out of school in the third or fourth grade -- they don &apos;t go .
So in the three years since I talked at TED and showed a prototype , it &apos;s gone from an idea to a real laptop .
We have half a million laptops today in the hands of children .
We have about a quarter of a million in transit to those and other children , and then there are another quarter of a million more that are being ordered at this moment .
So , in rough numbers , there are a million laptops .
That &apos;s smaller than I predicted -- I predicted three to 10 million -- but is still a very large number .
In Colombia , we have about 3,000 laptops .
It &apos;s the Minister of Defense with whom we &apos;re working , not the Minister of Education , because it is seen as a strategic defense issue in the sense of liberating these zones that had been completely closed off , in which the people who had been causing , if you will , 40 years &apos; worth of bombings and kidnappings and assassinations lived .
And suddenly , the kids have connected laptops .
They &apos;ve leapfrogged .
The change is absolutely monumental , because it &apos;s not just opening it up , but it &apos;s opening it up to the rest of the world .
So yes , they &apos;re building roads , yes , they &apos;re putting in telephone , yes , there will be television .
But the kids six to 12 years old are surfing the Internet in Spanish and in local languages , so the children grow up with access to information , with a window into the rest of the world .
Before , they were closed off .
Interestingly enough , in other countries , it will be the Minister of Finance who sees it as an engine of economic growth .
And that engine is going to see the results in 20 years .
It &apos;s not going to happen , you know , in one year , but it &apos;s an important , deeply economic and cultural change that happens through children .
Thirty-one countries in total are involved , and in the case of Uruguay , half the children already have them , and by the middle of 2009 , every single child in Uruguay will have a laptop -- a little green laptop .
Now what are some of the results ?
Some of the results that go across every single country include teachers saying they have never loved teaching so much , and reading comprehension measured by third parties -- not by us -- skyrockets .
Probably the most important thing we see is children teaching parents .
They own the laptops . They take them home .
And so when I met with three children from the schools , who had traveled all day to come to Bogota , one of the three children brought her mother .
And the reason she brought her mother is that this six-year-old child had been teaching her mother how to read and write .
Her mother had not gone to primary school .
And this is such an inversion , and such a wonderful example of children being the agents of change .
So now , in closing , people say , now why laptops ?
Laptops are a luxury ; it &apos;s like giving them iPods . No .
The reason you want laptops is that the word is education , not laptop .
This is an education project , not a laptop project .
They need to learn learning . And then , just think -- they can have , let &apos;s say , 100 books .
In a village , you have 100 laptops , each with a different set of 100 books , and so that village suddenly has 10,000 books .
You and I didn &apos;t have 10,000 books when we went to primary school .
Sometimes school is under a tree , or in many cases , the teacher has only a fifth-grade education , so you need a collaborative model of learning , not just building more schools and training more teachers , which you have to do anyway .
So we &apos;re once again doing &quot; Give One , Get One . &quot;
Last year , we ran a &quot; Give One , Get One &quot; program , and it generated over 100,000 laptops that we were then able to give free .
And by being a zero-dollar laptop , we can go to countries that can &apos;t afford it at all .
And that &apos;s what we did . We went to Haiti , we went to Rwanda , Afghanistan , Ethiopia , Mongolia .
Places that are not markets , seeding it with the principles of saturation , connectivity , low ages , etc .
And then we can actually roll out large numbers .
So think of it this way : think of it as inoculating children against ignorance .
And think of the laptop as a vaccine .
You don &apos;t vaccinate a few children .
You vaccinate all the children in an area .
Nate Silver : Does racism affect how you vote ?
Nate Silver has data that answers big questions about race in politics . For instance , in the 2008 presidential race , did Obama &apos;s skin color actually keep him from getting votes in some parts of the country ? Stats and myths collide in this fascinating talk that ends with a remarkable insight .
I want to talk about the election .
For the first time in the United States , a predominantly white group of voters voted for an African-American candidate for President .
And in fact Barack Obama did quite well .
He won 375 electoral votes .
And he won about 70 million popular votes more than any other presidential candidate -- of any race , of any party -- in history .
If you compare how Obama did against how John Kerry had done four years earlier -- Democrats really like seeing this transition here , where almost every state becomes bluer , becomes more democratic -- even states Obama lost , like out west , those states became more blue .
In the south , in the northeast , almost everywhere but with a couple of exceptions here and there .
One exception is in Massachusetts .
That was John Kerry &apos;s home state .
No big surprise , Obama couldn &apos;t do better than Kerry there .
Or in Arizona , which is John McCain &apos;s home , Obama didn &apos;t have much improvement .
But there is also this part of the country , kind of in the middle region here .
This kind of Arkansas , Tennessee , Oklahoma , West Virginia region .
Now if you look at &apos; 96 , Bill Clinton -- the last Democrat to actually win -- how he did in &apos; 96 , you see real big differences in this part of the country right here , the kind of Appalachians , Ozarks , highlands region , as I call it : 20 or 30 point swings from how Bill Clinton did in &apos; 96 to how Obama did in 2008 .
Yes Bill Clinton was from Arkansas , but these are very , very profound differences .
So , when we think about parts of the country like Arkansas , you know .
There is a book written called , &quot; What &apos;s the Matter with Kansas ? &quot;
But really the question here -- Obama did relatively well in Kansas .
He lost badly but every Democrat does .
He lost no worse than most people do .
But yeah , what &apos;s the matter with Arkansas ?
And when we think of Arkansas we tend to have pretty negative connotations .
We think of a bunch of rednecks , quote , unquote , with guns .
And we think people like this probably don &apos;t want to vote for people who look like this and are named Barack Obama .
We think it &apos;s a matter of race . And is this fair ?
Are we kind of stigmatizing people from Arkansas , and this part of the country ?
And the answer is : it is at least partially fair .
We know that race was a factor , and the reason why we know that is because we asked those people .
Actually we didn &apos;t ask them , but when they conducted exit polls in every state , in 37 states , out of the 50 , they asked a question , that was pretty direct , about race .
They asked this question .
In deciding your vote for President today , was the race of the candidate a factor ?
We &apos;re looking for people that said , &quot; Yes , race was a factor ; moreover it was an important factor , in my decision , &quot; and people who voted for John McCain as a result of that factor , maybe in combination with other factors , and maybe alone .
We &apos;re looking for this behavior among white voters or , really , non-black voters .
So you see big differences in different parts of the country on this question .
In Louisiana , about one in five white voters said , &quot; Yes , one of the big reasons why I voted against Barack Obama is because he was an African-American . &quot;
If those people had voted for Obama , even half of them , Obama would have won Louisiana safely .
Same is true with , I think , all of these states you see on the top of the list .
Meanwhile , California , New York , we can say , &quot; Oh we &apos;re enlightened &quot; but you know , certainly a much lower incidence of this admitted , I suppose , manifestation of racially-based voting .
Here is the same data on a map .
You kind of see the relationship between the redder states of where more people responded and said , &quot; Yes , Barack Obama &apos;s race was a problem for me . &quot;
You see , comparing the map to &apos; 96 , you see an overlap here .
This really seems to explain why Barack Obama did worse in this one part of the country .
So we have to ask why .
Is racism predictable in some way ?
Is there something driving this ?
Is it just about some weird stuff that goes on in Arkansas that we don &apos;t understand , and Kentucky ?
Or are there more systematic factors at work ?
And so we can look at a bunch of different variables .
These are things that economists and political scientists look at all the time -- things like income , and religion , education .
Which of these seem to drive this manifestation of racism in this big national experiment we had on November 4th ?
And there are a couple of these that have strong predictive relationships , one of which is education , where you see the states with the fewest years of schooling per adult are in red , and you see this part of the country , the kind of Appalachians region , is less educated . It &apos;s just a fact .
And you see the relationship there with the racially-based voting patterns .
The other variable that &apos;s important is the type of neighborhood that you live in .
States that are more rural -- even to some extent of the states like New Hampshire and Maine -- they exhibit a little bit of this racially-based voting against Barack Obama .
So it &apos;s the combination of these two things : it &apos;s education and the type of neighbors that you have , which we &apos;ll talk about more in a moment .
And the thing about states like Arkansas and Tennessee is that they &apos;re both very rural , and they are educationally impoverished .
So yes , racism is predictable .
These things , among maybe other variables , but these things seem to predict it .
We &apos;re going to drill down a little bit more now , into something called the General Social Survey .
This is conducted by the University of Chicago every other year .
And they ask a series of really interesting questions .
In 2000 they had particularly interesting questions about racial attitudes .
One simple question they asked is , &quot; Does anyone of the opposite race live in your neighborhood ? &quot;
We can see in different types of communities that the results are quite different .
In cites , about 80 percent of people have someone whom they consider a neighbor of another race , but in rural communities , only about 30 percent .
Probably because if you live on a farm , you might not have a lot of neighbors , period .
But nevertheless , you &apos;re not having a lot of interaction with people who are unlike you .
So what we &apos;re going to do now is take the white people in the survey and split them between those who have black neighbors -- or , really , some neighbor of another race -- and people who have only white neighbors .
And we see in some variables in terms of political attitudes , not a lot of difference .
This was eight years ago , some people were more Republican back then .
But you see Democrats versus Republican , not a big difference based on who your neighbors are .
And even some questions about race -- for example affirmative action , which is kind of a political question , a policy question about race , if you will -- not much difference here .
Affirmative action is not very popular frankly , with white voters , period .
But people with black neighbors and people with mono-racial neighborhoods feel no differently about it really .
But if you probe a bit deeper and get a bit more personal if you will , &quot; Do you favor a law banning interracial marriage ? &quot;
There is a big difference .
People who don &apos;t have neighbors of a different race are about twice as likely to oppose interracial marriage as people who do .
Just based on who lives in your immediate neighborhood around you .
And likewise they asked , not in 2000 , but in the same survey in 1996 , &quot; Would you not vote for a qualified black president ? &quot;
You see people without neighbors who are African-American who were much more likely to say , &quot; That would give me a problem . &quot;
So it &apos;s really not even about urban versus rural .
It &apos;s about who you live with .
Racism is predictable . And it &apos;s predicted by interaction or lack thereof with people unlike you , people of other races .
So if you want to address it , the goal is to facilitate interaction with people of other races .
I have a couple of very obvious , I suppose , ideas for maybe how to do that .
I &apos;m a big fan of cities .
Especially if we have cites that are diverse and sustainable , and can support people of different ethnicities and different income groups .
I think cities facilitate more of the kind of networking , the kind of casual interaction than you might have on a daily basis .
But also not everyone wants to live in a city , certainly not a city like New York .
So we can think more about things like street grids .
This is the neighborhood where I grew up in East Lansing , Michigan .
It &apos;s a traditional Midwestern community , which means you have real grid .
You have real neighborhoods and real trees , and real streets you can walk on .
And you interact a lot with your neighbors -- people you like , people you might not know .
And as a result it &apos;s a very tolerant community , which is different , I think , than something like this , which is in Schaumburg , Illinois , where every little set of houses has their own cul-de-sac and drive-through Starbucks and stuff like that .
I think that actually this type of urban design , which became more prevalent in the 1970s and 1980s -- I think there is a relationship between that and the country becoming more conservative under Ronald Reagan .
But also here is another idea we have -- is an intercollegiate exchange program where you have students going from New York abroad .
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU , have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas , and vice versa . Do it at the high school level .
Literally there are people who might be in school in Arkansas or Tennessee and might never interact in a positive affirmative way with someone from another part of the country , or of another racial group .
I think part of the education variable we talked about before is the networking experience you get when you go to college where you do get a mix of people that you might not interact with otherwise .
But the point is , this is all good news , because when something is predictable , it is what I call designable .
You can start thinking about solutions to solving that problem , even if the problem is pernicious and as intractable as racism .
If we understand the root causes of the behavior and where it manifests itself and where it doesn &apos;t , we can start to design solutions to it .
So that &apos;s all I have to say . Thank you very much .
Denis Dutton : A Darwinian theory of beauty
TED collaborates with animator Andrew Park to illustrate Denis Dutton &apos;s provocative theory on beauty -- that art , music and other beautiful things , far from being simply &quot; in the eye of the beholder , &quot; are a core part of human nature with deep evolutionary origins .
Delighted to be here and to talk to you about a subject dear to my heart , which is beauty .
I do the philosophy of art , aesthetics , actually , for a living .
I try to figure out intellectually , philosophically , psychologically , what the experience of beauty is , what sensibly can be said about it and how people go off the rails in trying to understand it .
Now this is an extremely complicated subject , in part because the things that we call beautiful are so different .
I mean just think of the sheer variety -- a baby &apos;s face , Berlioz &apos;s &quot; Harold in Italy , &quot; movies like &quot; The Wizard of Oz &quot; or the plays of Chekhov , a central California landscape , a Hokusai view of Mt . Fuji , &quot; Der Rosenkavalier , &quot; a stunning match-winning goal in a World Cup soccer match , Van Gogh &apos;s &quot; Starry Night , &quot; a Jane Austen novel , Fred Astaire dancing across the screen .
This brief list includes human beings , natural landforms , works of art and skilled human actions .
An account that explains the presence of beauty in everything on this list is not going to be easy .
I can , however , give you at least a taste of what I regard as the most powerful theory of beauty we yet have .
And we get it not from a philosopher of art , not from a postmodern art theorist or a bigwig art critic .
No , this theory comes from an expert on barnacles and worms and pigeon breeding , and you know who I mean : Charles Darwin .
Of course , a lot of people think they already know the proper answer to the question , &quot; What is beauty ? &quot;
It &apos;s in the eye of the beholder .
It &apos;s whatever moves you personally .
Or , as some people , especially academics prefer , beauty is in the culturally conditioned eye of the beholder .
People agree that paintings or movies or music are beautiful because their cultures determine a uniformity of aesthetic taste .
Taste for both natural beauty and for the arts travel across cultures with great ease .
Beethoven is adored in Japan .
Peruvians love Japanese woodblock prints .
Inca sculptures are regarded as treasures in British museums , while Shakespeare is translated into every major language of the Earth .
Or just think about American jazz or American movies -- they go everywhere .
There are many differences among the arts , but there are also universal , cross-cultural aesthetic pleasures and values .
How can we explain this universality ?
The best answer lies in trying to reconstruct a Darwinian evolutionary history of our artistic and aesthetic tastes .
We need to reverse-engineer our present artistic tastes and preferences and explain how they came to be engraved in our minds by the actions of both our prehistoric , largely pleistocene environments , where we became fully human , but also by the social situations in which we evolved .
This reverse engineering can also enlist help from the human record preserved in prehistory .
I mean fossils , cave paintings and so forth .
And it should take into account what we know of the aesthetic interests of isolated hunter-gatherer bands that survived into the 19th and the 20th centuries .
Now , I personally have no doubt whatsoever that the experience of beauty , with its emotional intensity and pleasure , belongs to our evolved human psychology .
The experience of beauty is one component in a whole series of Darwinian adaptations .
Beauty is an adaptive effect , which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
As many of you will know , evolution operates by two main primary mechanisms .
The first of these is natural selection -- that &apos;s random mutation and selective retention -- along with our basic anatomy and physiology -- the evolution of the pancreas or the eye or the fingernails .
Natural selection also explains many basic revulsions , such as the horrid smell of rotting meat , or fears , such as the fear of snakes or standing close to the edge of a cliff .
Natural selection also explains pleasures -- sexual pleasure , our liking for sweet , fat and proteins , which in turn explains a lot of popular foods , from ripe fruits through chocolate malts and barbecued ribs .
The other great principle of evolution is sexual selection , and it operates very differently .
The peacock &apos;s magnificent tail is the most famous example of this .
It did not evolve for natural survival .
In fact , it goes against natural survival .
No , the peacock &apos;s tail results from the mating choices made by peahens .
It &apos;s quite a familiar story .
It &apos;s women who actually push history forward .
Darwin himself , by the way , had no doubts that the peacock &apos;s tail was beautiful in the eyes of the peahen .
He actually used that word .
Now , keeping these ideas firmly in mind , we can say that the experience of beauty is one of the ways that evolution has of arousing and sustaining interest or fascination , even obsession , in order to encourage us toward making the most adaptive decisions for survival and reproduction .
Beauty is nature &apos;s way of acting at a distance , so to speak .
I mean , you can &apos;t expect to eat an adaptively beneficial landscape .
It would hardly do to eat your baby or your lover .
So evolution &apos;s trick is to make them beautiful , to have them exert a kind of magnetism to give you the pleasure of simply looking at them .
Consider briefly an important source of aesthetic pleasure , the magnetic pull of beautiful landscapes .
People in very different cultures all over the world tend to like a particular kind of landscape , a landscape that just happens to be similar to the pleistocene savannas where we evolved .
This landscape shows up today on calendars , on postcards , in the design of golf courses and public parks and in gold-framed pictures that hang in living rooms from New York to New Zealand .
It &apos;s a kind of Hudson River school landscape featuring open spaces of low grasses interspersed with copses of trees .
The trees , by the way , are often preferred if they fork near the ground , that is to say , if they &apos;re trees you could scramble up if you were in a tight fix .
The landscape shows the presence of water directly in view , or evidence of water in a bluish distance , indications of animal or bird life as well as diverse greenery and finally -- get this -- a path or a road , perhaps a riverbank or a shoreline , that extends into the distance , almost inviting you to follow it .
This landscape type is regarded as beautiful , even by people in countries that don &apos;t have it .
The ideal savanna landscape is one of the clearest examples where human beings everywhere find beauty in similar visual experience .
But , someone might argue , that &apos;s natural beauty .
How about artistic beauty ?
Isn &apos;t that exhaustively cultural ?
No , I don &apos;t think it is .
And once again , I &apos;d like to look back to prehistory to say something about it .
It is widely assumed that the earliest human artworks are the stupendously skillful cave paintings that we all know from Lascaux and Chauvet .
Chauvet caves are about 32,000 years old , along with a few small , realistic sculptures of women and animals from the same period .
But artistic and decorative skills are actually much older than that .
Beautiful shell necklaces that look like something you &apos;d see at an arts and crafts fair , as well as ochre body paint , have been found from around 100,000 years ago .
But the most intriguing prehistoric artifacts are older even than this .
I have in mind the so-called Acheulian hand axes .
The oldest stone tools are choppers from the Olduvai Gorge in East Africa .
They go back about two-and-a-half-million years .
These crude tools were around for thousands of centuries , until around 1.4 million years ago when Homo erectus started shaping single , thin stone blades , sometimes rounded ovals , but often in what are to our eyes an arresting , symmetrical pointed leaf or teardrop form .
These Acheulian hand axes -- they &apos;re named after St. Acheul in France , where finds were made in 19th century -- have been unearthed in their thousands , scattered across Asia , Europe and Africa , almost everywhere Homo erectus and Homo ergaster roamed .
Now , the sheer numbers of these hand axes shows that they can &apos;t have been made for butchering animals .
And the plot really thickens when you realize that , unlike other pleistocene tools , the hand axes often exhibit no evidence of wear on their delicate blade edges .
And some , in any event , are too big to use for butchery .
Their symmetry , their attractive materials and , above all , their meticulous workmanship are simply quite beautiful to our eyes , even today .
So what were these ancient -- I mean , they &apos;re ancient , they &apos;re foreign , but they &apos;re at the same time somehow familiar .
What were these artifacts for ?
The best available answer is that they were literally the earliest known works of art , practical tools transformed into captivating aesthetic objects , contemplated both for their elegant shape and their virtuoso craftsmanship .
Hand axes mark an evolutionary advance in human history -- tools fashioned to function as what Darwinians call &quot; fitness signals &quot; -- that is to say , displays that are performances like the peacock &apos;s tail , except that , unlike hair and feathers , the hand axes are consciously cleverly crafted .
Competently made hand axes indicated desirable personal qualities -- intelligence , fine motor control , planning ability , conscientiousness and sometimes access to rare materials .
Over tens of thousands of generations , such skills increased the status of those who displayed them and gained a reproductive advantage over the less capable .
You know , it &apos;s an old line , but it has been shown to work -- &quot; Why don &apos;t you come up to my cave , so I can show you my hand axes ? &quot;
Except , of course , what &apos;s interesting about this is that we can &apos;t be sure how that idea was conveyed , because the Homo erectus that made these objects did not have language .
It &apos;s hard to grasp , but it &apos;s an incredible fact .
This object was made by a hominid ancestor , Homo erectus or Homo ergaster , between 50,000 and 100,000 years before language .
Stretching over a million years , the hand axe tradition is the longest artistic tradition in human and proto-human history .
By the end of the hand axe epic , Homo sapiens -- as they were then called , finally -- were doubtless finding new ways to amuse and amaze each other by , who knows , telling jokes , storytelling , dancing , or hairstyling .
Yes , hairstyling -- I insist on that .
For us moderns , virtuoso technique is used to create imaginary worlds in fiction and in movies , to express intense emotions with music , painting and dance .
But still , one fundamental trait of the ancestral personality persists in our aesthetic cravings : the beauty we find in skilled performances .
From Lascaux to the Louvre to Carnegie Hall , human beings have a permanent innate taste for virtuoso displays in the arts .
We find beauty in something done well .
So the next time you pass a jewelry shop window displaying a beautifully cut teardrop-shaped stone , don &apos;t be so sure it &apos;s just your culture telling you that that sparkling jewel is beautiful .
Your distant ancestors loved that shape and found beauty in the skill needed to make it , even before they could put their love into words .
Is beauty in the eye of the beholder ?
No , it &apos;s deep in our minds .
It &apos;s a gift handed down from the intelligent skills and rich emotional lives of our most ancient ancestors .
Our powerful reaction to images , to the expression of emotion in art , to the beauty of music , to the night sky , will be with us and our descendants for as long as the human race exists .
Thank you .
Lawrence Lessig : We the People , and the Republic we must reclaim
There is a corruption at the heart of American politics , caused by the dependence of Congressional candidates on funding from the tiniest percentage of citizens . That &apos;s the argument at the core of this blistering talk by legal scholar Lawrence Lessig . With rapid-fire visuals , he shows how the funding process weakens the Republic in the most fundamental way , and issues a rallying bipartisan cry that will resonate with many in the U.S. and beyond .
Once upon a time , there was a place called Lesterland .
Now Lesterland looks a lot like the United States .
Like the United States , it has about 311 million people , and of that 311 million people , it turns out 144,000 are called Lester .
If Matt &apos;s in the audience , I just borrowed that , I &apos;ll return it in a second , this character from your series .
So 144,000 are called Lester , which means about .05 percent is named Lester .
Now , Lesters in Lesterland have this extraordinary power .
There are two elections every election cycle in Lesterland .
One is called the general election .
The other is called the Lester election .
And in the general election , it &apos;s the citizens who get to vote , but in the Lester election , it &apos;s the Lesters who get to vote .
And here &apos;s the trick .
In order to run in the general election , you must do extremely well in the Lester election .
You don &apos;t necessarily have to win , but you must do extremely well .
Now , what can we say about democracy in Lesterland ?
What we can say , number one , as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United , that people have the ultimate influence over elected officials , because , after all , there is a general election , but only after the Lesters have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in the general election .
And number two , obviously , this dependence upon the Lesters is going to produce a subtle , understated , we could say camouflaged , bending to keep the Lesters happy .
Okay , so we have a democracy , no doubt , but it &apos;s dependent upon the Lesters and dependent upon the people .
It has competing dependencies , we could say conflicting dependencies , depending upon who the Lesters are .
Okay . That &apos;s Lesterland .
Now there are three things I want you to see now that I &apos;ve described Lesterland .
Number one , the United States is Lesterland .
The United States is Lesterland .
The United States also looks like this , also has two elections , one we called the general election , the second we should call the money election .
In the general election , it &apos;s the citizens who get to vote , if you &apos;re over 18 , in some states if you have an ID .
In the money election , it &apos;s the funders who get to vote , the funders who get to vote , and just like in Lesterland , the trick is , to run in the general election , you must do extremely well in the money election .
You don &apos;t necessarily have to win . There is Jerry Brown .
But you must do extremely well .
And here &apos;s the key : There are just as few relevant funders in USA-land as there are Lesters in Lesterland .
Now you say , really ?
Really .05 percent ?
Well , here are the numbers from 2010 : .26 percent of America gave 200 dollars or more to any federal candidate , .05 percent gave the maximum amount to any federal candidate , .01 percent -- the one percent of the one percent -- gave 10,000 dollars or more to federal candidates , and in this election cycle , my favorite statistic is .000042 percent ‚Äî for those of you doing the numbers , you know that &apos;s 132 Americans ‚Äî gave 60 percent of the Super PAC money spent in the cycle we have just seen ending .
So I &apos;m just a lawyer , I look at this range of numbers , and I say it &apos;s fair for me to say it &apos;s .05 percent who are our relevant funders in America .
In this sense , the funders are our Lesters .
Now , what can we say about this democracy in USA-land ?
Well , as the Supreme Court said in Citizens United , we could say , of course the people have the ultimate influence over the elected officials . We have a general election , but only after the funders have had their way with the candidates who wish to run in that general election .
And number two , obviously , this dependence upon the funders produces a subtle , understated , camouflaged bending to keep the funders happy .
Candidates for Congress and members of Congress spend between 30 and 70 percent of their time raising money to get back to Congress or to get their party back into power , and the question we need to ask is , what does it do to them , these humans , as they spend their time behind the telephone , calling people they &apos;ve never met , but calling the tiniest slice of the one percent ?
As anyone would , as they do this , they develop a sixth sense , a constant awareness about how what they do might affect their ability to raise money .
They become , in the words of &quot; The X-Files , &quot; shape-shifters , as they constantly adjust their views in light of what they know will help them to raise money , not on issues one to 10 , but on issues 11 to 1,000 .
Leslie Byrne , a Democrat from Virginia , describes that when she went to Congress , she was told by a colleague , &quot; Always lean to the green . &quot;
Then to clarify , she went on , &quot; He was not an environmentalist . &quot;
So here too we have a democracy , a democracy dependent upon the funders and dependent upon the people , competing dependencies , possibly conflicting dependencies depending upon who the funders are .
Okay , the United States is Lesterland , point number one .
Here &apos;s point number two .
The United States is worse than Lesterland , worse than Lesterland because you can imagine in Lesterland if we Lesters got a letter from the government that said , &quot; Hey , you get to pick who gets to run in the general election , &quot; we would think maybe of a kind of aristocracy of Lesters .
You know , there are Lesters from every part of social society .
There are rich Lesters , poor Lesters , black Lesters , white Lesters , not many women Lesters , but put that to the side for one second .
We have Lesters from everywhere . We could think , &quot; What could we do to make Lesterland better ? &quot;
It &apos;s at least possible the Lesters would act for the good of Lesterland .
But in our land , in this land , in USA-land , there are certainly some sweet Lesters out there , many of them in this room here today , but the vast majority of Lesters act for the Lesters , because the shifting coalitions that are comprising the .05 percent are not comprising it for the public interest .
It &apos;s for their private interest . In this sense , the USA is worse than Lesterland .
And finally , point number three : Whatever one wants to say about Lesterland , against the background of its history , its traditions , in our land , in USA-land , Lesterland is a corruption , a corruption .
Now , by corruption I don &apos;t mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress .
I don &apos;t mean Rod Blagojevich sense of corruption .
I don &apos;t mean any criminal act .
The corruption I &apos;m talking about is perfectly legal .
It &apos;s a corruption relative to the framers &apos; baseline for this republic .
The framers gave us what they called a republic , but by a republic they meant a representative democracy , and by a representative democracy , they meant a government , as Madison put it in Federalist 52 , that would have a branch that would be dependent upon the people alone .
So here &apos;s the model of government .
They have the people and the government with this exclusive dependency , but the problem here is that Congress has evolved a different dependence , no longer a dependence upon the people alone , increasingly a dependence upon the funders .
Now this is a dependence too , but it &apos;s different and conflicting from a dependence upon the people alone so long as the funders are not the people .
This is a corruption .
Now , there &apos;s good news and bad news about this corruption .
One bit of good news is that it &apos;s bipartisan , equal-opportunity corruption .
It blocks the left on a whole range of issues that we on the left really care about .
It blocks the right too , as it makes principled arguments of the right increasingly impossible .
So the right wants smaller government .
When Al Gore was Vice President , his team had an idea for deregulating a significant portion of the telecommunications industry .
The chief policy man took this idea to Capitol Hill , and as he reported back to me , the response was , &quot; Hell no !
If we deregulate these guys , how are we going to raise money from them ? &quot;
This is a system that &apos;s designed to save the status quo , including the status quo of big and invasive government .
It works against the left and the right , and that , you might say , is good news .
But here &apos;s the bad news .
It &apos;s a pathological , democracy-destroying corruption , because in any system where the members are dependent upon the tiniest fraction of us for their election , that means the tiniest number of us , the tiniest , tiniest number of us , can block reform .
I know that should have been , like , a rock or something .
I can only find cheese . I &apos;m sorry . So there it is .
Block reform .
Because there is an economy here , an economy of influence , an economy with lobbyists at the center which feeds on polarization .
It feeds on dysfunction .
The worse that it is for us , the better that it is for this fundraising .
Henry David Thoreau : &quot; There are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the root . &quot;
This is the root .
Okay , now , every single one of you knows this .
You couldn &apos;t be here if you didn &apos;t know this , yet you ignore it .
You ignore it . This is an impossible problem .
You focus on the possible problems , like eradicating polio from the world , or taking an image of every single street across the globe , or building the first real universal translator , or building a fusion factory in your garage .
These are the manageable problems , so you ignore ‚Äî ‚Äî so you ignore this corruption .
But we cannot ignore this corruption anymore .
We need a government that works .
And not works for the left or the right , but works for the left and the right , the citizens of the left and right , because there is no sensible reform possible until we end this corruption .
So I want you to take hold , to grab the issue you care the most about .
Climate change is mine , but it might be financial reform or a simpler tax system or inequality .
Grab that issue , sit it down in front of you , look straight in its eyes , and tell it there is no Christmas this year .
There will never be a Christmas .
We will never get your issue solved until we fix this issue first .
So it &apos;s not that mine is the most important issue . It &apos;s not .
Yours is the most important issue , but mine is the first issue , the issue we have to solve before we get to fix the issues you care about .
No sensible reform , and we cannot afford a world , a future , with no sensible reform .
Okay . So how do we do it ?
Turns out , the analytics here are easy , simple .
If the problem is members spending an extraordinary amount of time fundraising from the tiniest slice of America , the solution is to have them spend less time fundraising but fundraise from a wider slice of Americans , to spread it out , to spread the funder influence so that we restore the idea of dependence upon the people alone .
And to do this does not require a constitutional amendment , changing the First Amendment .
To do this would require a single statute , a statute establishing what we think of as small dollar funded elections , a statute of citizen-funded campaigns , and there &apos;s any number of these proposals out there : Fair Elections Now Act , the American Anti-Corruption Act , an idea in my book that I call the Grant and Franklin Project to give vouchers to people to fund elections , an idea of John Sarbanes called the Grassroots Democracy Act .
Each of these would fix this corruption by spreading out the influence of funders to all of us .
The analytics are easy here .
It &apos;s the politics that &apos;s hard , indeed impossibly hard , because this reform would shrink K Street , and Capitol Hill , as Congressman Jim Cooper , a Democrat from Tennessee , put it , has become a farm league for K Street , a farm league for K Street .
Members and staffers and bureaucrats have an increasingly common business model in their head , a business model focused on their life after government , their life as lobbyists .
Fifty percent of the Senate between 1998 and 2004 left to become lobbyists , 42 percent of the House .
Those numbers have only gone up , and as United Republic calculated last April , the average increase in salary for those who they tracked was 1,452 percent .
So it &apos;s fair to ask , how is it possible for them to change this ?
Now I get this skepticism .
I get this cynicism . I get this sense of impossibility .
But I don &apos;t buy it .
This is a solvable issue .
If you think about the issues our parents tried to solve in the 20th century , issues like racism , or sexism , or the issue that we &apos;ve been fighting in this century , homophobia , those are hard issues .
You don &apos;t wake up one day no longer a racist .
It takes generations to tear that intuition , that DNA , out of the soul of a people .
But this is a problem of just incentives , just incentives .
Change the incentives , and the behavior changes , and the states that have adopted small dollar funded systems have seen overnight a change in the practice .
When Connecticut adopted this system , in the very first year , 78 percent of elected representatives gave up large contributions and took small contributions only .
It &apos;s solvable , not by being a Democrat , not by being a Republican .
It &apos;s solvable by being citizens , by being citizens , by being TEDizens .
Because if you want to kickstart reform , look , I could kickstart reform at half the price of fixing energy policy , I could give you back a republic .
Okay . But even if you &apos;re not yet with me , even if you believe this is impossible , what the five years since I spoke at TED has taught me as I &apos;ve spoken about this issue again and again is , even if you think it &apos;s impossible , that is irrelevant .
Irrelevant .
I spoke at Dartmouth once , and a woman stood up after I spoke , I write in my book , and she said to me , &quot; Professor , you &apos;ve convinced me this is hopeless . Hopeless .
There &apos;s nothing we can do . &quot;
When she said that , I scrambled .
I tried to think , &quot; How do I respond to that hopelessness ?
What is that sense of hopelessness ? &quot;
And what hit me was an image of my six-year-old son .
And I imagined a doctor coming to me and saying , &quot; Your son has terminal brain cancer , and there &apos;s nothing you can do .
Nothing you can do . &quot;
So would I do nothing ?
Would I just sit there ? Accept it ? Okay , nothing I can do ?
I &apos;m going off to build Google Glass .
Of course not . I would do everything I could , and I would do everything I could because this is what love means , that the odds are irrelevant and that you do whatever the hell you can , the odds be damned .
And then I saw the obvious link , because even we liberals love this country .
And so when the pundits and the politicians say that change is impossible , what this love of country says back is , &quot; That &apos;s just irrelevant . &quot;
We lose something dear , something everyone in this room loves and cherishes , if we lose this republic , and so we act with everything we can to prove these pundits wrong .
So here &apos;s my question : Do you have that love ?
Do you have that love ?
Because if you do , then what the hell are you , what are the hell are we doing ?
When Ben Franklin was carried from the constitutional convention in September of 1787 , he was stopped in the street by a woman who said , &quot; Mr. Franklin , what have you wrought ? &quot;
Franklin said , &quot; A republic , madam , if you can keep it . &quot;
A republic . A representative democracy .
A government dependent upon the people alone .
We have lost that republic .
All of us have to act to get it back .
Thank you very much .
Thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Gary Greenberg : The beautiful nano details of our world
When photographed under a 3D microscope , grains of sand appear like colorful pieces of candy and the stamens in a flower become like fantastical spires at an amusement park . Gary Greenberg reveals the thrilling details of the micro world .
So I want to talk a little bit about seeing the world from a totally unique point of view , and this world I &apos;m going to talk about is the micro world .
I &apos;ve found , after doing this for many , many years , that there &apos;s a magical world behind reality .
And that can be seen directly through a microscope , and I &apos;m going to show you some of this today .
So let &apos;s start off looking at something rather not-so-small , something that we can see with our naked eye , and that &apos;s a bee . So when you look at this bee , it &apos;s about this size here , it &apos;s about a centimeter .
But to really see the details of the bee , and really appreciate what it is , you have to look a little bit closer .
So that &apos;s just the eye of the bee with a microscope , and now all of a sudden you can see that the bee has thousands of individual eyes called ommatidia , and they actually have sensory hairs in their eyes so they know when they &apos;re right up close to something , because they can &apos;t see in stereo .
As we go smaller , here is a human hair .
A human hair is about the smallest thing that the eye can see .
It &apos;s about a tenth of a millimeter .
And as we go smaller again , about ten times smaller than that , is a cell .
So you could fit 10 human cells across the diameter of a human hair .
So when we would look at cells , this is how I really got involved in biology and science is by looking at living cells in the microscope .
When I first saw living cells in a microscope , I was absolutely enthralled and amazed at what they looked like .
So if you look at the cell like that from the immune system , they &apos;re actually moving all over the place .
This cell is looking for foreign objects , bacteria , things that it can find .
And it &apos;s looking around , and when it finds something , and recognizes it being foreign , it will actually engulf it and eat it .
So if you look right there , it finds that little bacterium , and it engulfs it and eats it .
If you take some heart cells from an animal , and put it in a dish , they &apos;ll just sit there and beat .
That &apos;s their job . Every cell has a mission in life , and these cells , the mission is to move blood around our body .
These next cells are nerve cells , and right now , as we see and understand what we &apos;re looking at , our brains and our nerve cells are actually doing this right now . They &apos;re not just static . They &apos;re moving around making new connections , and that &apos;s what happens when we learn .
As you go farther down this scale here , that &apos;s a micron , or a micrometer , and we go all the way down to here to a nanometer and an angstrom . Now , an angstrom is the size of the diameter of a hydrogen atom .
That &apos;s how small that is .
And microscopes that we have today can actually see individual atoms . So these are some pictures of individual atoms . Each bump here is an individual atom .
This is a ring of cobalt atoms .
So this whole world , the nano world , this area in here is called the nano world , and the nano world , the whole micro world that we see , there &apos;s a nano world that is wrapped up within that , and the whole -- and that is the world of molecules and atoms .
But I want to talk about this larger world , the world of the micro world .
So if you were a little tiny bug living in a flower , what would that flower look like , if the flower was this big ?
It wouldn &apos;t look or feel like anything that we see when we look at a flower . So if you look at this flower here , and you &apos;re a little bug , if you &apos;re on that surface of that flower , that &apos;s what the terrain would look like .
The petal of that flower looks like that , so the ant is kind of crawling over these objects , and if you look a little bit closer at this stigma and the stamen here , this is the style of that flower , and you notice that it &apos;s got these little -- these are like little jelly-like things that are what are called spurs . These are nectar spurs .
So this little ant that &apos;s crawling here , it &apos;s like it &apos;s in a little Willy Wonka land .
It &apos;s like a little Disneyland for them . It &apos;s not like what we see .
These are little bits of individual grain of pollen there and there , and here is a -- what you see as one little yellow dot of pollen , when you look in a microscope , it &apos;s actually made of thousands of little grains of pollen .
So this , for example , when you see bees flying around these little plants , and they &apos;re collecting pollen , those pollen grains that they &apos;re collecting , they pack into their legs and they take it back to the hive , and that &apos;s what makes the beehive , the wax in the beehive . And they &apos;re also collecting nectar , and that &apos;s what makes the honey that we eat .
Here &apos;s a close-up picture , or this is actually a regular picture of a water hyacinth , and if you had really , really good vision , with your naked eye , you &apos;d see it about that well .
There &apos;s the stamen and the pistil . But look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope . That &apos;s the stamen .
So that &apos;s thousands of little grains of pollen there , and there &apos;s the pistil there , and these are the little things called trichomes . And that &apos;s what makes the flower give a fragrance , and plants actually communicate with one another through their fragrances .
I want to talk about something really ordinary , just ordinary sand .
I became interested in sand about 10 years ago , when I first saw sand from Maui , and in fact , this is a little bit of sand from Maui .
So sand is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
Each sand grain is about a tenth of a millimeter in size .
But when you look closer at this , look at what &apos;s there .
It &apos;s really quite amazing . You have microshells there .
You have things like coral .
You have fragments of other shells . You have olivine .
You have bits of a volcano . There &apos;s a little bit of a volcano there . You have tube worms .
An amazing array of incredible things exist in sand .
And the reason that is , is because in a place like this island , a lot of the sand is made of biological material because the reefs provide a place where all these microscopic animals or macroscopic animals grow , and when they die , their shells and their teeth and their bones break up and they make grains of sand , things like coral and so forth .
So here &apos;s , for example , a picture of sand from Maui .
This is from Lahaina , and when we &apos;re walking along a beach , we &apos;re actually walking along millions of years of biological and geological history .
We don &apos;t realize it , but it &apos;s actually a record of that entire ecology .
So here we see , for example , a sponge spicule , two bits of coral here , that &apos;s a sea urchin spine . Really some amazing stuff .
So when I first looked at this , I was -- I thought , gee , this is like a little treasure trove here .
I couldn &apos;t believe it , and I &apos;d go around dissecting the little bits out and making photographs of them .
Here &apos;s what most of the sand in our world looks like .
These are quartz crystals and feldspar , so most sand in the world on the mainland is made of quartz crystal and feldspar . It &apos;s the erosion of granite rock .
So mountains are built up , and they erode away by water and rain and ice and so forth , and they become grains of sand .
There &apos;s some sand that &apos;s really much more colorful .
These are sand from near the Great Lakes , and you can see that it &apos;s filled with minerals like pink garnet and green epidote , all kinds of amazing stuff , and if you look at different sands from different places , every single beach , every single place you look at sand , it &apos;s different . Here &apos;s from Big Sur , like they &apos;re little jewels .
There are places in Africa where they do the mining of jewels , and you go to the sand where the rivers have the sand go down to the ocean , and it &apos;s like literally looking at tiny jewels through the microscope .
So every grain of sand is unique . Every beach is different .
Every single grain is different . There are no two grains of sand alike in the world .
Every grain of sand is coming somewhere and going somewhere .
They &apos;re like a snapshot in time .
Now sand is not only on Earth , but sand is ubiquitous throughout the universe . In fact , outer space is filled with sand , and that sand comes together to make our planets and the Moon .
And you can see those in micrometeorites .
This is some micrometeorites that the Army gave me , and they get these out of the drinking wells in the South Pole .
And they &apos;re quite amazing-looking , and these are the tiny constituents that make up the world that we live in -- the planets and the Moon .
So NASA wanted me to take some pictures of Moon sand , so they sent me sand from all the different landings of the Apollo missions that happened 40 years ago .
And I started taking pictures with my three-dimensional microscopes .
This was the first picture I took . It was kind of amazing .
I thought it looked kind of a little bit like the Moon , which is sort of interesting .
Now , the way my microscopes work is , normally in a microscope you can see very little at one time , so what you have to do is you have to refocus the microscope , keep taking pictures , and then I have a computer program that puts all those pictures together into one picture so you can see actually what it looks like , and I do that in 3D . So there , you can see , is a left-eye view . There &apos;s a right-eye view .
So sort of left-eye view , right-eye view .
Now something &apos;s interesting here . This looks very different than any sand on Earth that I &apos;ve ever seen , and I &apos;ve seen a lot of sand on Earth , believe me .
Look at this hole in the middle . That hole was caused by a micrometeorite hitting the Moon .
Now , the Moon has no atmosphere , so micrometeorites come in continuously , and the whole surface of the Moon is covered with powder now , because for four billion years it &apos;s been bombarded by micrometeorites , and when micrometeorites come in at about 20 to 60,000 miles an hour , they vaporize on contact .
And you can see here that that is -- that &apos;s sort of vaporized , and that material is holding this little clump of little sand grains together .
This is a very small grain of sand , this whole thing .
And that &apos;s called a ring agglutinate .
And many of the grains of sand on the Moon look like that , and you &apos;d never find that on Earth .
Most of the sand on the Moon , especially -- and you know when you look at the Moon , there &apos;s the dark areas and the light areas . The dark areas are lava flows . They &apos;re basaltic lava flows , and that &apos;s what this sand looks like , very similar to the sand that you would see in Haleakala .
Other sands , when these micrometeorites come in , they vaporize and they make these fountains , these microscopic fountains that go up into the -- I was going to say &quot; up into the air , &quot; but there is no air -- goes sort of up , and these microscopic glass beads are formed instantly , and they harden , and by the time they fall down back to the surface of the Moon , they have these beautiful colored glass spherules .
And these are actually microscopic ; you need a microscope to see these .
Now here &apos;s a grain of sand that is from the Moon , and you can see that the entire crystal structure is still there .
This grain of sand is probably about three and a half or four billion years old , and it &apos;s never eroded away like the way we have sand on Earth erodes away because of water and tumbling , air , and so forth . All you can see is a little bit of erosion down here by the Sun , has these solar storms , and that &apos;s erosion by solar radiation .
So what I &apos;ve been trying to tell you today is things even as ordinary as a grain of sand can be truly extraordinary if you look closely and if you look from a different and a new point of view .
I think that this was best put by William Blake when he said , &quot; To see a world in a grain of sand and a heaven in a wild flower , hold infinity in the palm of your hand , and eternity in an hour . &quot;
Thank you .
Edith Widder : The weird , wonderful world of bioluminescence
In the deep , dark ocean , many sea creatures make their own light for hunting , mating and self-defense . Bioluminescence expert Edith Widder was one of the first to film this glimmering world . At TED2011 , she brings some of her glowing friends onstage , and shows more astonishing footage of glowing undersea life .
So I want to take you on a trip to an alien world .
And it &apos;s not a trip that requires light-years of travel , but it &apos;s to a place where it &apos;s defined by light .
So it &apos;s a little-appreciated fact that most of the animals in our ocean make light .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career studying this phenomenon called bioluminescence .
I study it because I think understanding it is critical to understanding life in the ocean where most bioluminescence occurs .
I also use it as a tool for visualizing and tracking pollution .
But mostly I &apos;m entranced by it .
Since my my first dive in a deep-diving submersible , when I went down and turned out the lights and saw the fireworks displays , I &apos;ve been a bioluminescence junky .
But I would come back from those dives and try to share the experience with words , and they were totally inadequate to the task .
I needed some way to share the experience directly .
And the first time I figured out that way was in this little single-person submersible called Deep Rover .
This next video clip , you &apos;re going to see how we stimulated the bioluminescence .
And the first thing you &apos;re going to see is a transect screen that is about a meter across .
In front of the sub , a mess screen will come into contact with the soft-bodied creatures of the deep sea .
With the sub &apos;s lights switched off , it is possible to see their bioluminescence -- the light produced when they collide with the mesh .
This is the first time it has ever been recorded .
Edith Widder : So I recorded that with an intensified video camera that has about the sensitivity of the fully dark-adapted human eye .
Which means that really is what you would see if you took a dive in a submersible .
But just to try to prove that fact to you , I &apos;ve brought along some bioluminescent plankton in what is undoubtedly a foolhardy attempt at a live demonstration .
So , if we could have the lights down and have it as dark in here as possible , I have a flask that has bioluminescent plankton in it .
And you &apos;ll note there &apos;s no light coming from them right now , either because they &apos;re dead -- or because I need to stir them up in some way for you to see what bioluminescence really looks like .
Oops . Sorry .
I spend most of my time working in the dark ; I &apos;m used to that .
Okay .
So that light was made by a bioluminescent dinoflagellate , a single-celled alga .
So why would a single-celled alga need to be able to produce light ?
Well , it uses it to defend itself from its predators .
The flash is like a scream for help .
It &apos;s what &apos;s known as a bioluminescent burglar alarm , and just like the alarm on your car or your house , it &apos;s meant to cast unwanted attention onto the intruder , thereby either leading to his capture or scaring him away .
There &apos;s a lot of animals that use this trick , for example this black dragonfish .
It &apos;s got a light organ under its eye .
It &apos;s got a chin barbel .
It &apos;s got a lot of other light organs you can &apos;t see , but you &apos;ll see in here in a minute .
So we had to chase this in the submersible for quite sometime , because the top speed of this fish is one knot , which was the top speed of the submersible .
But it was worth it , because we caught it in a special capture device , brought it up into the lab on the ship , and then everything on this fish lights up .
It &apos;s unbelievable .
The light organs under the eyes are flashing .
That chin barbel is flashing .
It &apos;s got light organs on its belly that are flashing , fin lights .
It &apos;s a scream for help ; it &apos;s meant to attract attention .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
And you normally don &apos;t get to see this because we &apos;ve exhausted the luminescence when we bring them up in nets .
There &apos;s other ways you can defend yourself with light .
For example , this shrimp releases its bioluminescent chemicals into the water just the way a squid or an octopus would release an ink cloud .
This blinds or distracts the predator .
This little squid is called the fire shooter because of its ability to do this .
Now it may look like a tasty morsel , or a pig &apos;s head with wings -- but if it &apos;s attacked , it puts out a barrage of light -- in fact , a barrage of photon torpedoes .
I just barely got the lights out in time for you to be able to see those gobs of light hitting the transect screen and then just glowing .
It &apos;s phenomenal .
So there &apos;s a lot of animals in the open ocean -- most of them that make light .
And we have a pretty good idea , for most of them , why .
They use it for finding food , for attracting mates , for defending against predators .
But when you get down to the bottom of the ocean , that &apos;s where things get really strange .
And some of these animals are probably inspiration for the things you saw in &quot; Avatar , &quot; but you don &apos;t have to travel to Pandora to see them .
They &apos;re things like this .
This is a golden coral , a bush .
It grows very slowly .
In fact , it &apos;s thought that some of these are as much as 3,000 years old , which is one reason that bottom trawling should not be allowed .
The other reason is this amazing bush glows .
So if you brush up against it , any place you brushed against it , you get this twinkling blue-green light that &apos;s just breathtaking .
And you see things like this .
This looks like something out of a Dr. Seuss book -- just all manner of creatures all over this thing .
And these are flytrap anemones .
Now if you poke it , it pulls in its tentacles .
But if you keep poking it , it starts to produce light .
And it actually ends up looking like a galaxy .
It produces these strings of light , presumably as some form of defense .
There are starfish that can make light .
And there are brittle stars that produce bands of light that dance along their arms .
This looks like a plant , but it &apos;s actually an animal .
And it anchors itself in the sand by blowing up a balloon on the end of its stock .
So it can actually hold itself in very strong currents , as you see here .
But if we collect it very gently , and we bring it up into the lab and just squeeze it at the base of the stock , it produces this light that propagates from stem to the plume , changing color as it goes , from green to blue .
Colorization and sound effects added for you viewing pleasure .
But we have no idea why it does that .
Here &apos;s another one . This is also a sea pen .
It &apos;s got a brittle star hitching a ride .
It &apos;s a green saber of light .
And like the one you just saw , it can produce these as bands of light .
So if I squeeze the base , the bands go from base to tip .
If I squeeze the tip , they go from tip to base .
So what do you think happens if you squeeze it in the middle ?
I &apos;d be very interested in your theories about what that &apos;s about .
So there &apos;s a language of light in the deep ocean , and we &apos;re just beginning to understand it , and one way we &apos;re going about that is we &apos;re imitating a lot of these displays .
This is an optical lure that I &apos;ve used .
We call it the electronic jellyfish .
It &apos;s just 16 blue LEDs that we can program to do different types of displays .
And we view it with a camera system I developed called Eye-in-the-Sea that uses far red light that &apos;s invisible to most animals , so it &apos;s unobtrusive .
So I just want to show you some of the responses we &apos;ve elicited from animals in the deep sea .
So the camera &apos;s black and white .
It &apos;s not high-resolution .
And what you &apos;re seeing here is a bait box with a bunch of -- like the cockroaches of the ocean -- there are isopods all over it .
And right in the front is the electronic jellyfish .
And when it starts flashing , it &apos;s just going to be one of the LEDs that &apos;s flashing very fast .
But as soon as it starts to flash -- and it &apos;s going to look big , because it blooms on the camera -- I want you to look right here .
There &apos;s something small there that responds .
We &apos;re talking to something .
It looks like a little of string pearls basically -- in fact , three strings of pearls .
And this was very consistent .
This was in the Bahamas at about 2,000 feet .
We basically have a chat room going on here , because once it gets started , everybody &apos;s talking .
And I think this is actually a shrimp that &apos;s releasing its bioluminescent chemicals into the water .
But the cool thing is , we &apos;re talking to it .
We don &apos;t know what we &apos;re saying .
Personally , I think it &apos;s something sexy .
And then finally , I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world &apos;s first deep-sea webcam , which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year .
We &apos;ve only just begun to analyze all of this data .
This is going to be a glowing source first , which is like bioluminescent bacteria .
And it is an optical cue that there &apos;s carrion on the bottom of the ocean .
So this scavenger comes in , which is a giant sixgill shark .
And I can &apos;t claim for sure that the optical source brought it in , because there &apos;s bait right there .
But if it had been following the odor plume , it would have come in from the other direction .
And it does actually seem to be trying to eat the electronic jellyfish .
That &apos;s a 12-foot-long giant sixgill shark .
Okay , so this next one is from the webcam , and it &apos;s going to be this pinwheel display .
And this is a burglar alarm .
And that was a Humboldt squid , a juvenile Humboldt squid , about three feet long .
This is at 3,000 feet in Monterey Canyon .
But if it &apos;s a burglar alarm , you wouldn &apos;t expect it to attack the jellyfish directly .
It &apos;s supposed to be attacking what &apos;s attacking the jellyfish .
But we did see a bunch of responses like this .
This guy is a little more contemplative .
&quot; Hey , wait a minute .
There &apos;s supposed to be something else there . &quot;
He &apos;s thinking about it .
But he &apos;s persistent .
He keeps coming back .
And then he goes away for a few seconds to think about it some more , and thinks , &quot; Maybe if I come in from a different angle . &quot;
Nope .
So we are starting to get a handle on this , but only just the beginnings .
We need more eyes on the process .
So if any of you ever get a chance to take a dive in a submersible , by all means , climb in and take the plunge .
This is something that should be on everybody &apos;s bucket list , because we live on an ocean planet .
More than 90 percent , 99 percent , of the living space on our planet is ocean .
It &apos;s a magical place filled with breathtaking light shows and bizarre and wondrous creatures , alien life forms that you don &apos;t have to travel to another planet to see .
But if you do take the plunge , please remember to turn out the lights .
But I warn you , it &apos;s addictive .
Thank you .
Vusi Mahlasela : &quot; Thula Mama &quot;
South African singer-songwriter Vusi Mahlasela dedicates his song , &quot; Thula Mama , &quot; to all women -- and especially his grandmother .
I &apos;d like to dedicate this one to all the women in South Africa -- those women who refused to dwindle in the midst of apartheid .
And , of course , I &apos;m dedicating it also to my grandmother , whom I think really played quite a lot of important roles , especially for me when I was an activist , and being harassed by the police .
You will recall that in 1976 , June 16 , the students of South Africa boycotted the language of Afrikaans as the medium of the oppressor , as they were sort of like really told that they must do everything in Afrikaans -- biology , mathematics -- and what about our languages ?
And the students wanted to speak to the government , and police answered with bullets .
So every year , June 16 , we will commemorate all those comrades or students who died .
And I was very young then . I think I was 11 years , and I started asking questions , and that &apos;s when my political education started .
And I joined , later on , the youth organization under the African National Congress .
So as part of organizing this and whatever , this commemoration , the police will round us up as they call us leaders .
And I used to run away from home , when I know that maybe the police might be coming around the ninth or 10th of June or so .
And my grandmother one time said , &quot; No , look , you &apos;re not going to run away .
This is your place , you stay here . &quot;
And indeed , the police came -- because they &apos;ll just arrest us and put us in jail and release us whenever they feel like , after the 20th or so .
So it was on the 10th of June , and they came , and they surrounded the house , and my grandmother switched off all the lights in the house , and opened the kitchen door .
And she said to them , &quot; Vusi &apos;s here , and you &apos;re not going to take him tonight .
I &apos;m tired of you having to come here , harassing us , while your children are sleeping peacefully in your homes .
He is here , and you &apos;re not going to take him .
I &apos;ve got a bowl full of boiling water -- the first one who comes in here , gets it . &quot;
And they left .
Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama . Through the mist of the tears in your eyes on my childhood memory , I know the truth in your smile , I know the truth in your smile , piercing through the gloom of my ignorance . Oh , there is a mama lying down sleeping you &apos;re very ill and your heart crying . Wondering , wondering , wondering , wondering where is this world coming to . Is it right the children have to fend for themselves ? No , no , no , no , no. no . Is it right heaping trouble on an old lady &apos;s head ? So unlucky faceless people . Thula Mama Mama , Thula Mama . Thula Mama Mama . Thula Mama , Thula Mama , Thula Mama Mama , Thula Mama Tomorrow it &apos;s going to be better . Tomorrow it &apos;s going to be better to climb , Mama . Thula Mama , Thula Mama . Am I to break into the song like the blues man or troubadour . And then from long distance in no blues club am I to sing , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby , baby . Should I now stop singing of love , now that my memory &apos;s surrounded by blood ? Sister , why oh why do we at times mistake a pimple for a cancer ? So who are they who says , no more love poems now ? I want to sing a song of love for that woman who jumped the fences pregnant and still gave birth to a healthy child . Softly I walk into the sun rays of the smile that will ignite my love song , my song of life , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love , my song of life . Ooh , I &apos;ve not tried to run away from song , I hear a persistent voice , more powerful than the enemy bombs . The song that washed our lives and the rains of our blood . My song of love and my song of life , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love -- I want everybody to sing with me -- my song of life , my song of love , my song of life -- everybody sing with me -- my song of life , my song of love -- I can &apos;t hear you -- my song of love , my song of life -- you can do better -- my song of life , my song of love -- keep singing , keep singing -- my song of love , my song of life , yes , my song of love -- you can do better than that -- my song of life , yes , my song of love , my song of life , my song of love -- keep singing , keep singing , keep singing -- my song of love . Oh yeah . My song of -- a love song , my song of life . Sing . A love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Sing . Love song , my song of life . Love song , my song of life .
Gary Lauder &apos;s new traffic sign : Take Turns
Fifty percent of traffic accidents happen at intersections . Gary Lauder shares a brilliant and cheap idea for helping drivers move along smoothly : a new traffic sign that combines the properties of &quot; Stop &quot; and &quot; Yield . &quot;
I only have three minutes so I &apos;m going to have to talk fast , and it will use up your spare mental cycles , so multitasking may be hard .
So , 27 years ago I got a traffic ticket that got me thinking .
I &apos;ve had some time to think it over .
And energy efficiency is more than just about the vehicle -- it &apos;s also about the road .
Road design makes a difference , particularly intersections , of which there are two types : signalized and unsignalized , which means stop signs .
Fifty percent of crashes happen at intersections .
Roundabouts are much better .
A study of 24 intersections has found crashes drop 40 percent from when you convert a traffic light into a roundabout .
Injury crashes have dropped 76 percent , fatal crashes down 90 percent .
But that &apos;s just safety .
What about time and gas ?
So , traffic keeps flowing , so that means less braking , which means less accelerating , less gas and less pollution , less time wasted , and that partly accounts for Europe &apos;s better efficiency than we have in the United States .
So , unsignalized intersections , meaning stop signs , they save many lives , but there &apos;s an excessive proliferation of them .
Small roundabouts are starting to appear .
This is one in my neighborhood . And they are much better -- better than traffic lights , better than four-way stop signs .
They &apos;re expensive to install , but they are more expensive not to . So , we should look at that .
But they are not applicable in all situations .
So , take , for example , the three-way intersection .
So , it &apos;s logical that you &apos;d have one there , on the minor road entering the major .
But the other two are somewhat questionable .
So , here &apos;s one . There &apos;s another one which I studied .
Cars rarely appear on that third road .
And so , the question is , what does that cost us ?
That intersection I looked at had about 3,000 cars per day in each direction , and so that &apos;s two ounces of gas to accelerate out of .
That &apos;s five cents each , and times 3,000 cars per day , that &apos;s $ 51,000 per year .
That &apos;s just the gasoline cost . There is also pollution , wear on the car , and time .
What &apos;s that time worth ?
Well , at 10 seconds per 3,000 cars , that &apos;s 8.3 hours per day . The average wage in the U.S.
is $ 20 an hour . That is 60,000 per year .
Add that together with the gas , and it &apos;s $ 112,000 per year , just for that sign in each direction .
Discount that back to the present , at five percent : over two million dollars for a stop sign , in each direction .
Now , if you look at what that adjacent property is worth , you could actually buy the property , cut down the shrubbery to improve the sight line , and then sell it off again .
And you &apos;d still come out ahead .
So , it makes one wonder , &quot; Why is it there ? &quot;
I mean , why is there that stop sign in each direction ?
Because it is saving lives . So , is there a better way to accomplish that goal ?
The answer is to enable cars to come in from that side road safely .
Because there are a lot of people who might live up there and if they &apos;re waiting forever a long queue could form because the cars aren &apos;t slowing down on the main road .
Can that be accomplished with existing signs ?
So , there is a long history of stop signs and yield signs .
Stop signs were invented in 1915 , yield signs in 1950 . But that &apos;s all we got .
So , why not use a yield sign ?
Well the meaning of yield is : You must yield the right-of-way .
That means that if there are five cars waiting , you have to wait till they all go , then you go . It lacks the notion of alternating , or taking turns , and it &apos;s always on the minor road , allowing the major one to have primacy .
So , it &apos;s hard to create a new meaning for the existing sign .
You couldn &apos;t suddenly tell everyone , &quot; OK , remember what you used to do at yield signs ? Now do something different . &quot;
That would not work .
So , what the world needs now is a new type of sign .
So , you &apos;d have a little instruction below it , you know , for those who didn &apos;t see the public service announcements .
And it merges the stop sign and yield signs .
It &apos;s kind of shaped like a T , as in taking turns .
And uncertainty results in caution .
When people come to an unfamiliar situation they don &apos;t know how to deal with they slow down .
So , now that you are all &quot; Road Scholars &quot; ...
don &apos;t wait for that sign to be adopted , these things don &apos;t change quickly .
But you all are members of communities , and you can exercise your community influence to create more sensible traffic flows .
And you can have more impact on the environment just getting your neighborhood to change these things than by changing your vehicle . Thank you very much .
Maira Kalman : The illustrated woman
Author and illustrator Maira Kalman talks about her life and work , from her covers for The New Yorker to her books for children and grown-ups . She is as wonderful , as wise and as deliciously off-kilter in person as she is on paper .
What I am always thinking about is what this session is about , which is called simplicity .
And almost , I would almost call it being simple-minded , but in the best sense of the word .
I &apos;m trying to figure out two very simple things : how to live and how to die , period .
That &apos;s all I &apos;m trying to do , all day long .
And I &apos;m also trying to have some meals , and have some snacks , and , you know , and yell at my children , and do all the normal things that keep you grounded .
So , I was fortunate enough to be born a very dreamy child .
My older sister was busy torturing my parents , and they were busy torturing her .
I was lucky enough to be completely ignored , which is a fabulous thing , actually , I want to tell you .
So , I was able to completely daydream my way through my life .
And I finally daydreamed my way into NYU , at a very good time , in 1967 , where I met a man who was trying to blow up the math building of NYU .
And I was writing terrible poetry and knitting sweaters for him .
And feminists hated us , and the whole thing was wretched from beginning to end .
But I kept writing bad poetry , and he didn &apos;t blow up the math building , but he went to Cuba .
But I gave him the money , because I was from Riverdale so I had more money than he did .
And that was a good thing to help , you know , the cause .
But , then he came back , and things happened , and I decided I really hated my writing , that it was awful , awful , purple prose .
And I decided that I wanted to tell -- but I still wanted to tell a narrative story and I still wanted to tell my stories .
So I decided that I would start to draw . How hard could that be ?
And so what happened was that I started just becoming an editorial illustrator through , you know , sheer whatever , sheer ignorance .
And we started a studio .
Well , Tibor really started the studio , called M &amp; amp ; Co .
And the premise of M &amp; amp ; Co was , we don &apos;t know anything , but that &apos;s all right , we &apos;re going to do it anyway .
And as a matter of fact , it &apos;s better not to know anything , because if you know too much , you &apos;re stymied .
So , the premise in the studio was , there are no boundaries , there is no fear .
And I -- and my full-time job , I landed the best job on Earth , was to daydream , and to actually come up with absurd ideas that -- fortunately , there were enough people there , and it was a team , it was a collective , it was not just me coming up with crazy ideas .
But the point was that I was there as myself , as a dreamer .
And so some of the things -- I mean , it was a long history of M &amp; amp ; Co , and clearly we also needed to make some money , so we decided we would create a series of products .
And some of the watches there , attempting to be beautiful and humorous -- maybe not attempting , hopefully succeeding .
That to be able to talk about content , to break apart what you normally expect , to use humor and surprise , elegance and humanity in your work was really important to us .
It was a very high , it was a very impersonal time in design and we wanted to say , the content is what &apos;s important , not the package , not the wrapping .
You really have to be journalists , you have to be inventors , you have to use your imagination more importantly than anything .
So , the good news is that I have a dog and , though I don &apos;t know if I believe in luck -- I don &apos;t know what I believe in , it &apos;s a very complicated question , but I do know that before I go away , I crank his tail seven times .
So , whenever he sees a suitcase in the house , because everybody &apos;s always , you know , leaving , they &apos;re always cranking this wonderful dog &apos;s tail , and he runs to the other room .
But I am able to make the transition from working for children and -- from working for adults to children , and back and forth , because , you know , I can say that I &apos;m immature , and in a way , that &apos;s true .
I don &apos;t really -- I mean , I could tell you that I didn &apos;t understand , I &apos;m not proud of it , but I didn &apos;t understand let &apos;s say 95 percent of the talks at this conference .
But I have been taking beautiful notes of drawings and I have a gorgeous onion from Murray Gell-Mann &apos;s talk .
And I have a beautiful page of doodles from Jonathan Woodham &apos;s talk .
So , good things come out of , you know , incomprehension -- -- which I will do a painting of , and then it will end up in my work .
So , I &apos;m open to the possibilities of not knowing and finding out something new .
So , in writing for children , it seems simple , and it is .
You have to condense a story into 32 pages , usually .
And what you have to do is , you really have to edit down to what you want to say .
And hopefully , you &apos;re not talking down to kids and you &apos;re not talking in such a way that you , you know , couldn &apos;t stand reading it after one time .
So , I hopefully am writing , you know , books that are good for children and for adults .
But the painting reflects -- I don &apos;t think differently for children than I do for adults .
I try to use the same kind of imagination , the same kind of whimsy , the same kind of love of language .
So , you know , and I have lots of wonderful-looking friends .
This is Andrew Gatz , and he walked in through the door and I said , &quot; You ! Sit down there . &quot; You know , I take lots of photos .
And the Bertoia chair in the background is my favorite chair .
So , I get to put in all of the things that I love .
Hopefully , a dialog between adults and children will happen on many different levels , and hopefully different kinds of humor will evolve .
And the books are really journals of my life .
I never -- I don &apos;t like plots .
I don &apos;t know what a plot means .
I can &apos;t stand the idea of anything that starts in the beginning , you know , beginning , middle and end . It really scares me , because my life is too random and too confused , and I enjoy it that way .
But anyway , so we were in Venice , and this is our room . And I had this dream that I was wearing this fantastic green gown , and I was looking out the window , and it was really a beautiful thing .
And so , I was able to put that into this story , which is an alphabet , and hopefully go on to something else .
The letter C had other things in it .
I was fortunate also , to meet the man who &apos;s sitting on the bed , though I gave him hair over here and he doesn &apos;t have hair .
Well , he has some hair but -- well , he used to have hair .
And with him , I was able to do a project that was really fantastic .
I work for the New Yorker , and I do covers , and 9 / 11 happened and it was , you know , a complete and utter end of the world as we knew it .
And Rick and I were on our way to a party in the Bronx , and somebody said Bronxistan , and somebody said Ferreristan , and we came up with this New Yorker cover , which we were able to -- we didn &apos;t know what we were doing .
We weren &apos;t trying to be funny , we weren &apos;t trying to be -- well , we were trying to be funny actually , that &apos;s not true .
We hoped we &apos;d be funny , but we didn &apos;t know it would be a cover , and we didn &apos;t know that that image , at the moment that it happened , would be something that would be so wonderful for a lot of people .
And it really became the -- I don &apos;t know , you know , it was one of those moments people started laughing at what was going on .
And from , you know , Fattushis , to Taxistan to , you know , for the Fashtoonks , Botoxia , Pashmina , Khlintunisia , you know , we were able to take the city and make fun of this completely foreign , who are -- what &apos;s going on over here ?
Who are these people ? What are these tribes ?
And David Remnick , who was really wonderful about it , had one problem . He didn &apos;t like Al Zheimers , because he thought it would insult people with Alzheimer &apos;s .
But you know , we said , &quot; David , who &apos;s going to know ?
They &apos;re not . &quot;
So it stayed in , and it was , and , you know , it was a good thing .
You know , in the course of my life , I never know what &apos;s going to happen and that &apos;s kind of the beauty part .
And we were on Cape Cod , a place , obviously , of great inspiration , and I picked up this book , &quot; The Elements of Style , &quot; at a yard sale .
And I didn &apos;t -- and I &apos;d never used it in school , because I was too busy writing poems , and flunking out , and I don &apos;t know what , sitting in cafes .
But I picked it up and I started reading it and I thought , this book is amazing .
I said , people should know about this book .
So I decided it needed a few -- it needed a lift , it needed a few illustrations .
And basically , I called the , you know , I convinced the White Estate , and what an intersection of like , you know , Polish Jew , you know , main WASP family . Here I am , saying , I &apos;d like to do something to this book .
And they said yes , and they left me completely alone , which was a gorgeous , wonderful thing .
And I took the examples that they gave , and just did 56 paintings , basically .
So , this is , I don &apos;t know if you can read this .
&quot; Well , Susan , this is a fine mess you are in . &quot;
And when you &apos;re dealing with grammar , which is , you know , incredibly dry , E.B. White wrote such wonderful , whimsical -- and actually , Strunk -- and then you come to the rules and , you know , there are lots of grammar things . &quot; Do you mind me asking a question ?
Do you mind my asking a question ? &quot;
&quot; Would , could , should , or would , should , could . &quot;
And &quot; would &quot; is Coco Chanel &apos;s lover , &quot; should &quot; is Edith Sitwell , and &quot; could &quot; is an August Sander subject .
And , &quot; He noticed a large stain in the center of the rug . &quot;
So , there &apos;s a kind of British understatement , murder-mystery theme that I really love very much .
And then , &quot; Be obscure clearly ! Be wild of tongue in a way we can understand . &quot;
E.B. White wrote us a number of rules , which can either paralyze you and make you loathe him for the rest of time , or you can ignore them , which I do , or you can , I don &apos;t know what , you know , eat a sandwich .
So , what I did when I was painting was I started singing , because I really adore singing , and I think that music is the highest form of all art .
So , I commissioned a wonderful composer , Nico Muhly , who wrote nine songs using the text , and we performed this fantastic evening of -- he wrote music for both amateurs and professionals .
I played the clattering teacup and the slinky in the main reading room of the New York Public Library , where you &apos;re supposed to be very , very quiet , and it was a phenomenally wonderful event , which we hopefully will do some more .
Who knows ? The New York TimesSelect , the op-ed page , asked me to do a column , and they said , you can do whatever you want .
So , once a month for the last year , I &apos;ve been doing a column called &quot; The Principles of Uncertainty , &quot; which , you know , I don &apos;t know who Heisenberg is , but I know I can throw that around now . You know , it &apos;s the principles of uncertainty , so , you know .
I &apos;m going to read quickly -- and probably I &apos;m going to edit some , because I don &apos;t have that much time left -- a few of the columns .
And basically , I was so , you know , it was so amusing , because I said , &quot; Well , how much space do I have ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; Well , you know , it &apos;s the Internet . &quot;
And I said , &quot; Yes , but how much space do I have ? &quot;
And they said , &quot; It &apos;s unlimited , it &apos;s unlimited . &quot;
OK . So , the first one I was very timid , and I &apos;ll begin .
&quot; How can I tell you everything that is in my heart ?
Impossible to begin . Enough . No . Begin with the hapless dodo . &quot;
And I talk about the dodo , and how the dodo became extinct , and then I talk about Spinoza .
&quot; As the last dodo was dying , Spinoza was looking for a rational explanation for everything , called eudaemonia .
And then he breathed his last , with loved ones around him , and I know that he had chicken soup also , as his last meal . &quot;
I happen to know it for a fact .
And then he died , and there was no more Spinoza . Extinct .
And then , we don &apos;t have a stuffed Spinoza , but we do have a stuffed Pavlov &apos;s dog , and I visited him in the Museum of Hygiene in St. Petersburg , in Russia .
And there he is , with this horrible electrical box on his rump in this fantastic , decrepit palace .
&quot; And I think it must have been a very , very dark day when the Bolsheviks arrived .
Maybe amongst themselves they had a few good laughs , but Stalin was a paranoid man , even more than my father . &quot;
You don &apos;t even know .
&quot; And decided his top people had to be extinctified . &quot;
Which I think I made up , which is a good thing .
And so , this is a chart of , you know , just a small chart , because the chart would go on forever of all the people that he killed .
So , shot dead , smacked over the head , you know , thrown away .
&quot; Nabokov &apos;s family fled Russia . How could the young Nabokov , sitting innocently and elegantly in a red chair , leafing through a book and butterflies , imagine such displacement , such loss ? &quot;
And then I want to tell you that this is a map .
So , &quot; My beautiful mother &apos;s family fled Russia as well .
Too many pogroms .
Leaving the shack , the wild blueberry woods , the geese , the River Sluch , they went to Palestine and then America . &quot;
And my mother drew this map for me of the United States of America , and that is my DNA over here , because that person who I grew up with had no use for facts whatsoever .
Facts were actually banished from our home .
And so , if you see that Texas -- you know , Texas and California are under Canada , and that South Carolina is on top of North Carolina , this is the home that I grew up in , OK ?
So , it &apos;s a miracle that I &apos;m here today .
But actually , it &apos;s not . It &apos;s actually a wonderful thing .
But then she says Tel Aviv and Lenin , which is the town they came from , and , &quot; Sorry , the rest unknown , thank you . &quot;
But in her lexicon , &quot; sorry , the rest unknown , thank you &quot; is &quot; sorry , the rest unknown , go to hell , &quot; because she couldn &apos;t care less .
&quot; The Impossibility of February &quot; is that February &apos;s a really wretched month in New York and the images for me conjure up these really awful things .
Well , not so awful .
I received a box in the mail and it was wrapped with newspaper and there was the picture of the man on the newspaper and he was dead .
And I say , &quot; I hope he &apos;s not really dead , just enjoying a refreshing lie-down in the snow , but the caption says he is dead . &quot;
And actually , he was . I think he &apos;s dead , though I don &apos;t know , maybe he &apos;s not dead .
&quot; And this woman leans over in anguish , not about that man , but about all sad things . It happens quite often in February . &quot;
There &apos;s consoling .
This man is angry because somebody threw onions all over the staircase , and basically -- you know , I guess onions are a theme here .
And he says , &quot; It is impossible not to lie .
It is February and not lying is impossible . &quot;
And I really spend a lot of time wondering , how much truth do we tell ?
What is it that we &apos;re actually -- what story are we actually telling ?
How do we know when we are ourselves ?
How do we actually know that these sentences coming out of our mouths are real stories , you know , are real sentences ?
Or are they fake sentences that we think we ought to be saying ?
I &apos;m going to quickly go through this .
A quote by Bertrand Russell , &quot; All the labor of all the ages , all the devotion , all the inspiration , all the noonday brightness of human genius are destined to extinction .
So now , my friends , if that is true , and it is true , what is the point ? &quot;
A complicated question .
And so , you know , I talk to my friends and I go to plays where they &apos;re singing Russian songs .
Oh my God , you know what ?
Could we have -- no , we don &apos;t have time .
I taped my aunt . I taped my aunt singing a song in Russian from the -- you know , could we have it for a second ?
Do you have that ?
OK . I taped my -- my aunt used to swim in the ocean every day of the year until she was about 85 .
So -- and that &apos;s a song about how everybody &apos;s miserable because , you know , we &apos;re from Russia .
I went to visit Kitty Carlisle Hart , and she is 96 , and when I brought her a copy of &quot; The Elements of Style , &quot; she said she would treasure it .
And then I said -- oh , and she was talking about Moss Hart , and I said , &quot; When you met him , you knew it was him . &quot;
And she said , &quot; I knew it was he . &quot;
So , I was the one who should have kept the book , but it was a really wonderful moment .
And she dated George Gershwin , so , you know , get out .
Gershwin died at the age of 38 .
He &apos;s buried in the same cemetery as my husband .
I don &apos;t want to talk about that now .
I do want to talk -- the absolute icing on this cemetery cake is the Barricini family mausoleum nearby .
I think the Barricini family should open a store there and sell chocolate .
And I would like to run it for them .
And I went to visit Louise Bourgeoise , who &apos;s also still working , and I looked at her sink , which is really amazing , and left .
And then I photograph and do a painting of a sofa on the street .
And a woman who lives on our street , Lolita .
And then I go and have some tea .
And then my Aunt Frances dies , and before she died , she tried to pay with Sweet &apos;N Low packets for her bagel .
And I wonder what the point is and then I know , and I see that Hy Meyerowitz , Rick Meyerowitz &apos;s father , a dry-cleaning supply salesman from the Bronx , won the Charlie Chaplin look-alike contest in 1931 .
That &apos;s actually Hy .
And I look at a beautiful bowl of fruit , and I look at a dress that I sewed for friends of mine .
And it says , &quot; Ich habe genug , &quot; which is a Bach cantata , which I once thought meant &quot; I &apos;ve had it , I can &apos;t take it anymore , give me a break , &quot; but I was wrong .
It means &quot; I have enough . &quot; And that is utterly true .
I happen to be alive , end of discussion . Thank you .
Gabe Barcia-Colombo : My DNA vending machine
Vending machines generally offer up sodas , candy bars and chips . Not so for the one created by TED Fellow Gabe Barcia-Colombo . This artist has dreamed up a DNA Vending Machine , which dispenses extracted human DNA , packaged in a vial along with a collectible photo of the person who gave it . It &apos;s charming and quirky , but points out larger ethical issues that will arise as access to biotechnology increases .
This is a vending machine in Los Angeles .
It &apos;s in a shopping mall , and it sells fish eggs .
It &apos;s a caviar vending machine .
This is the Art-o-mat , an art vending machine that sells small artistic creations by different artists , usually on small wood blocks or matchboxes , in limited edition .
This is Oliver Medvedik . He &apos;s not a vending machine , but he is one of the founders of Genspace , a community biolab in Brooklyn , New York , where anybody can go and take classes and learn how to do things like grow E. coli that glows in the dark or learn how to take strawberry DNA .
In fact , I saw Oliver do one of these strawberry DNA extractions about a year ago , and this is what led me onto this bizarre path that I &apos;m going to talk to you right now .
Because strawberry DNA is really fascinating , because it &apos;s so beautiful .
I &apos;d never thought about DNA being a beautiful thing before , before I saw it in this form .
And a lot of people , especially in the art community , don &apos;t necessarily engage in science in this way .
I instantly joined Genspace after this , and I asked Oliver , &quot; Well , if we can do this strawberries , can we do this with people as well ? &quot;
And about 10 minutes later , we were both spinning it in vials together and coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction .
And I started doing this on my own , and this is what my DNA actually looks like .
And I was at a dinner party with some friends , some artist friends , and I was telling them about this project , and they couldn &apos;t believe that you could actually see DNA .
So I said , all right , let &apos;s get out some supplies right now .
And I started having these bizarre dinner parties at my house on Friday nights where people would come over and we would do DNA extractions , and I would actually capture them on video , because it created this kind of funny portrait as well .
These are people who don &apos;t necessarily regularly engage with science whatsoever .
You can kind of tell from their reactions .
But they became fascinated by it , and it was really exciting for me to see them get excited about science .
And so I started doing this regularly .
It &apos;s kind of an odd thing to do with your Friday nights , but this is what I started doing , and I started collecting a whole group of my friends &apos; DNA in small vials and categorizing them .
This is what that looked like .
And it started to make me think about a couple of things .
First of all , this looked a lot like my Facebook wall .
So in a way , I &apos;ve created sort of a genetic network , a genetic social network , really .
And the second thing was , one time a friend came over and looked at this on my table and was like , &quot; Oh .
Why are they numbered ? Is this person more rare than the other one ? &quot;
And I hadn &apos;t even thought about that .
They were just numbered because that was the order that I extracted the DNA in .
But that made me think about collecting toys , and this thing that &apos;s going on right now in the toy world with blind box toys , and being able to collect these rare toys .
You buy these boxes . You &apos;re not sure what &apos;s going to be inside of them .
But then , when you open them up , you have different rarities of the toys .
And so I thought that was interesting .
I started thinking about this and the caviar vending machine and the Art-o-mat all together , and some reason , I was one night drawing a vending machine , thinking about doing paintings of a vending machine , and the little vial of my DNA was sitting there , and I saw this kind of beautiful collaboration between the strands of DNA and the coils of a vending machine .
And so , of course , I decided to create an art installation called the DNA Vending Machine .
Here it is .
&#91; &quot; DNA Vending Machine is an art installation about our increasing access to biotechnology . &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; For a reasonable cost , you can purchase a sample of human DNA from a traditional vending machine . &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; Each sample comes packaged with a collectible limited edition portrait of the human specimen . &quot; &#93; &#91; &quot; DNA Vending Machine treats DNA as a collectible material and brings to light legal issues over the ownership of DNA . &quot; &#93; Gabriel Garcia-Colombo : So the DNA Vending Machine is currently in a couple galleries in New York , and it &apos;s selling out pretty well , actually .
We &apos;re in the first edition of 100 pieces , hoping to do another edition pretty soon .
I &apos;d actually like to get it into more of a metro hub , like Grand Central or Penn Station , right next to some of the other , actual vending machines in that location .
But really with this project and a lot of my art projects I want to ask the audience a question , and that is , when biotechnology and DNA sequencing becomes as cheap as , say , laser cutting or 3D printing or buying caviar from a vending machine , will you still submit your sample of DNA to be part of the vending machine ?
And how much will these samples be worth ?
And will you buy someone else &apos;s sample ?
And what will you be able to do with that sample ?
Thank you .
Dan Dennett : The illusion of consciousness
Philosopher Dan Dennett makes a compelling argument that not only don &apos;t we understand our own consciousness , but that half the time our brains are actively fooling us .
So I &apos;m going to speak about a problem that I have and that &apos;s that I &apos;m a philosopher .
When I go to a party and people ask me what do I do and I say , &quot; I &apos;m a professor , &quot; their eyes glaze over .
When I go to an academic cocktail party and there are all the professors around , they ask me what field I &apos;m in and I say , &quot; philosophy &quot; -- their eyes glaze over .
When I go to a philosopher &apos;s party and they ask me what I work on and I say , &quot; consciousness , &quot; their eyes don &apos;t glaze over -- their lips curl into a snarl .
And I get hoots of derision and cackles and growls because they think , &quot; That &apos;s impossible ! You can &apos;t explain consciousness . &quot;
The very chutzpah of somebody thinking that you could explain consciousness is just out of the question .
My late , lamented friend Bob Nozick , a fine philosopher , in one of his books , &quot; Philosophical Explanations , &quot; is commenting on the ethos of philosophy -- the way philosophers go about their business .
And he says , you know , &quot; Philosophers love rational argument . &quot;
And he says , &quot; It seems as if the ideal argument for most philosophers is you give your audience the premises and then you give them the inferences and the conclusion , and if they don &apos;t accept the conclusion , they die .
Their heads explode . &quot; The idea is to have an argument that is so powerful that it knocks out your opponents .
But in fact that doesn &apos;t change people &apos;s minds at all .
It &apos;s very hard to change people &apos;s minds about something like consciousness , and I finally figured out the reason for that .
The reason for that is that everybody &apos;s an expert on consciousness .
We heard the other day that everybody &apos;s got a strong opinion about video games .
They all have an idea for a video game , even if they &apos;re not experts .
But they don &apos;t consider themselves experts on video games ; they &apos;ve just got strong opinions .
I &apos;m sure that people here who work on , say , climate change and global warming , or on the future of the Internet , encounter people who have very strong opinions about what &apos;s going to happen next .
But they probably don &apos;t think of these opinions as expertise .
They &apos;re just strongly held opinions .
But with regard to consciousness , people seem to think , each of us seems to think , &quot; I am an expert .
Simply by being conscious , I know all about this . &quot;
And so , you tell them your theory and they say , &quot; No , no , that &apos;s not the way consciousness is !
No , you &apos;ve got it all wrong . &quot;
And they say this with an amazing confidence .
And so what I &apos;m going to try to do today is to shake your confidence . Because I know the feeling -- I can feel it myself .
I want to shake your confidence that you know your own innermost minds -- that you are , yourselves , authoritative about your own consciousness .
That &apos;s the order of the day here .
Now , this nice picture shows a thought-balloon , a thought-bubble .
I think everybody understands what that means .
That &apos;s supposed to exhibit the stream of consciousness .
This is my favorite picture of consciousness that &apos;s ever been done .
It &apos;s a Saul Steinberg of course -- it was a New Yorker cover .
And this fellow here is looking at the painting by Braque .
That reminds him of the word baroque , barrack , bark , poodle , Suzanne R. -- he &apos;s off to the races .
There &apos;s a wonderful stream of consciousness here and if you follow it along , you learn a lot about this man .
What I particularly like about this picture , too , is that Steinberg has rendered the guy in this sort of pointillist style .
Which reminds us , as Rod Brooks was saying yesterday : what we are , what each of us is -- what you are , what I am -- is approximately 100 trillion little cellular robots .
That &apos;s what we &apos;re made of .
No other ingredients at all . We &apos;re just made of cells , about 100 trillion of them .
Not a single one of those cells is conscious ; not a single one of those cells knows who you are , or cares .
Somehow , we have to explain how when you put together teams , armies , battalions of hundreds of millions of little robotic unconscious cells -- not so different really from a bacterium , each one of them -- the result is this . I mean , just look at it .
The content -- there &apos;s color , there &apos;s ideas , there &apos;s memories , there &apos;s history . And somehow all that content of consciousness is accomplished by the busy activity of those hoards of neurons .
How is that possible ? Many people just think it isn &apos;t possible at all .
They think , &quot; No , there can &apos;t be any sort of naturalistic explanation of consciousness . &quot;
This is a lovely book by a friend of mine named Lee Siegel , who &apos;s a professor of religion , actually , at the University of Hawaii , and he &apos;s an expert magician , and an expert on the street magic of India , which is what this book is about , &quot; Net of Magic . &quot;
And there &apos;s a passage in it which I would love to share with you .
It speaks so eloquently to the problem .
&quot; &apos; I &apos;m writing a book on magic , &apos; I explain , and I &apos;m asked , &apos; Real magic ? &apos; By &apos; real magic , &apos; people mean miracles , thaumaturgical acts , and supernatural powers .
&apos;No , &apos; I answer . &apos; Conjuring tricks , not real magic . &apos; &apos; Real magic , &apos; in other words , refers to the magic that is not real ; while the magic that is real , that can actually be done , is not real magic . &quot;
Now , that &apos;s the way a lot of people feel about consciousness .
Real consciousness is not a bag of tricks .
If you &apos;re going to explain this as a bag of tricks , then it &apos;s not real consciousness , whatever it is .
And , as Marvin said , and as other people have said , &quot; Consciousness is a bag of tricks . &quot;
This means that a lot of people are just left completely dissatisfied and incredulous when I attempt to explain consciousness .
So this is the problem . So I have to that a lot of you won &apos;t like , for the same reason that you don &apos;t like to see a magic trick explained to you .
How many of you here , if somebody -- some smart aleck -- starts telling you how a particular magic trick is done , you sort of want to block your ears and say , &quot; No , no , I don &apos;t want to know !
Don &apos;t take the thrill of it away . I &apos;d rather be mystified .
Don &apos;t tell me the answer . &quot;
A lot of people feel that way about consciousness , I &apos;ve discovered .
And I &apos;m sorry if I impose some clarity , some understanding on you .
You &apos;d better leave now if you don &apos;t want to know some of these tricks .
But I &apos;m not going to explain it all to you .
I &apos;m going to do what philosophers do .
Here &apos;s how a philosopher explains the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick .
You know the sawing-the-lady-in-half trick ?
The philosopher says , &quot; I &apos;m going to explain to you how that &apos;s done .
You see , the magician doesn &apos;t really saw the lady in half . &quot;
&quot; He merely makes you think that he does . &quot;
And you say , &quot; Yes , and how does he do that ? &quot;
He says , &quot; Oh , that &apos;s not my department , I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
So now I &apos;m going to illustrate how philosophers explain consciousness .
But I &apos;m going to try to also show you that consciousness isn &apos;t quite as marvelous -- your own consciousness isn &apos;t quite as wonderful -- as you may have thought it is .
This is something , by the way , that Lee Siegel talks about in his book .
He marvels at how he &apos;ll do a magic show , and afterwards people will swear they saw him do X , Y , and Z. He never did those things .
He didn &apos;t even try to do those things .
People &apos;s memories inflate what they think they saw .
And the same is true of consciousness .
Now , let &apos;s see if this will work . All right . Let &apos;s just watch this .
Watch it carefully .
I &apos;m working with a young computer-animator documentarian named Nick Deamer , and this is a little demo that he &apos;s done for me , part of a larger project some of you may be interested in .
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
It &apos;s a feature-length documentary on consciousness .
OK , now , you all saw what changed , right ?
How many of you noticed that every one of those squares changed color ?
Every one . I &apos;ll just show you by running it again .
Even when you know that they &apos;re all going to change color , it &apos;s very hard to notice . You have to really concentrate to pick up any of the changes at all .
Now , this is an example -- one of many -- of a phenomenon that &apos;s now being studied quite a bit .
It &apos;s one that I predicted in the last page or two of my 1991 book , &quot; Consciousness Explained , &quot; where I said if you did experiments of this sort , you &apos;d find that people were unable to pick up really large changes .
If there &apos;s time at the end , I &apos;ll show you the much more dramatic case .
Now , how can it be that there are all those changes going on , and that we &apos;re not aware of them ?
Well , earlier today , Jeff Hawkins mentioned the way your eye saccades , the way your eye moves around three or four times a second .
He didn &apos;t mention the speed . Your eye is constantly in motion , moving around , looking at eyes , noses , elbows , looking at interesting things in the world .
And where your eye isn &apos;t looking , you &apos;re remarkably impoverished in your vision .
That &apos;s because the foveal part of your eye , which is the high-resolution part , is only about the size of your thumbnail held at arms length .
That &apos;s the detail part .
It doesn &apos;t seem that way , does it ?
It doesn &apos;t seem that way , but that &apos;s the way it is .
You &apos;re getting in a lot less information than you think .
Here &apos;s a completely different effect . This is a painting by Bellotto .
It &apos;s in the museum in North Carolina .
Bellotto was a student of Canaletto &apos;s .
And I love paintings like that -- the painting is actually about as big as it is right here .
And I love Canalettos , because Canaletto has this fantastic detail , and you can get right up and see all the details on the painting .
And I started across the hall in North Carolina , because I thought it was probably a Canaletto , and would have all that in detail .
And I noticed that on the bridge there , there &apos;s a lot of people -- you can just barely see them walking across the bridge .
And I thought as I got closer I would be able to see all the detail of most people , see their clothes , and so forth .
And as I got closer and closer , I actually screamed .
I yelled out because when I got closer , I found the detail wasn &apos;t there at all .
There were just little artfully placed blobs of paint .
And as I walked towards the picture , I was expecting detail that wasn &apos;t there .
The artist had very cleverly suggested people and clothes and wagons and all sorts of things , and my brain had taken the suggestion .
You &apos;re familiar with a more recent technology , which is -- There , you can get a better view of the blobs .
See , when you get close they &apos;re really just blobs of paint .
You will have seen something like this -- this is the reverse effect .
I &apos;ll just give that to you one more time .
Now , what does your brain do when it takes the suggestion ?
When an artful blob of paint or two , by an artist , suggests a person -- say , one of Marvin Minsky &apos;s little society of mind -- do they send little painters out to fill in all the details in your brain somewhere ?
I don &apos;t think so . Not a chance . But then , how on Earth is it done ?
Well , remember the philosopher &apos;s explanation of the lady ?
It &apos;s the same thing .
The brain just makes you think that it &apos;s got the detail there .
You think the detail &apos;s there , but it isn &apos;t there .
The brain isn &apos;t actually putting the detail in your head at all .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
Let &apos;s just do this experiment very quickly .
Is the shape on the left the same as the shape on the right , rotated ?
Yes .
How many of you did it by rotating the one on the left in your mind &apos;s eye , to see if it matched up with the one on the right ?
How many of you rotated the one on the right ? OK .
How do you know that &apos;s what you did ?
There &apos;s in fact been a very interesting debate raging for over 20 years in cognitive science -- various experiments started by Roger Shepherd , who measured the angular velocity of rotation of mental images .
Yes , it &apos;s possible to do that .
But the details of the process are still in significant controversy .
And if you read that literature , one of the things that you really have to come to terms with is even when you &apos;re the subject in the experiment , you don &apos;t know .
You don &apos;t know how you do it .
You just know that you have certain beliefs .
And they come in a certain order , at a certain time .
And what explains the fact that that &apos;s what you think ?
Well , that &apos;s where you have to go backstage and ask the magician .
This is a figure that I love : Bradley , Petrie , and Dumais .
You may think that I &apos;ve cheated , that I &apos;ve put a little whiter-than-white boundary there .
How many of you see that sort of boundary , with the Necker cube floating in front of the circles ?
Can you see it ?
Well , you know , in effect , the boundary &apos;s really there , in a certain sense .
Your brain is actually computing that boundary , the boundary that goes right there .
But now , notice there are two ways of seeing the cube , right ?
It &apos;s a Necker cube .
Everybody can see the two ways of seeing the cube ? OK .
Can you see the four ways of seeing the cube ?
Because there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
If you &apos;re seeing it as a cube floating in front of some circles , some black circles , there &apos;s another way of seeing it .
As a cube , on a black background , as seen through a piece of Swiss cheese .
Can you get it ? How many of you can &apos;t get it ? That &apos;ll help .
Now you can get it . These are two very different phenomena .
When you see the cube one way , behind the screen , those boundaries go away .
But there &apos;s still a sort of filling in , as we can tell if we look at this .
We don &apos;t have any trouble seeing the cube , but where does the color change ?
Does your brain have to send little painters in there ?
The purple-painters and the green-painters fight over who &apos;s going to paint that bit behind the curtain ? No .
Your brain just lets it go . The brain doesn &apos;t need to fill that in .
When I first started talking about the Bradley , Petrie , Dumais example that you just saw -- I &apos;ll go back to it , this one -- I said that there was no filling-in behind there .
And I supposed that that was just a flat truth , always true .
But Rob Van Lier has recently shown that it isn &apos;t .
Now , if you think you see some pale yellow -- I &apos;ll run this a few more times .
Look in the gray areas , and see if you seem to see something sort of shadowy moving in there -- yeah , it &apos;s amazing . There &apos;s nothing there . It &apos;s no trick .
&#91; &quot; Failure to Detect Changes in Scenes &quot; slide &#93; This is Ron Rensink &apos;s work , which was in some degree inspired by that suggestion right at the end of the book .
Let me just pause this for a second if I can .
This is change-blindness .
What you &apos;re going to see is two pictures , one of which is slightly different from the other .
You see here the red roof and the gray roof , and in between them there will be a mask , which is just a blank screen , for about a quarter of a second .
So you &apos;ll see the first picture , then a mask , then the second picture , then a mask .
And this will just continue , and your job as the subject is to press the button when you see the change .
So , show the original picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
Show the next picture for 240 milliseconds . Blank .
And keep going , until the subject presses the button , saying , &quot; I see the change . &quot;
So now we &apos;re going to be subjects in the experiment .
We &apos;re going to start easy . Some examples .
No trouble there .
Can everybody see ? All right .
Indeed , Rensink &apos;s subjects took only a little bit more than a second to press the button .
Can you see that one ?
2.9 seconds .
How many don &apos;t see it still ?
What &apos;s on the roof of that barn ?
It &apos;s easy .
Is it a bridge or a dock ?
There are a few more really dramatic ones , and then I &apos;ll close .
I want you to see a few that are particularly striking .
This one because it &apos;s so large and yet it &apos;s pretty hard to see .
Can you see it ?
Audience : Yes .
Dan Dennett : See the shadows going back and forth ? Pretty big .
So 15.5 seconds is the median time for subjects in his experiment there .
I love this one . I &apos;ll end with this one , just because it &apos;s such an obvious and important thing .
How many still don &apos;t see it ? How many still don &apos;t see it ?
How many engines on the wing of that Boeing ?
Right in the middle of the picture !
Thanks very much for your attention .
What I wanted to show you is that scientists , using their from-the-outside , third-person methods , can tell you things about your own consciousness that you would never dream of , and that , in fact , you &apos;re not the authority on your own consciousness that you think you are .
And we &apos;re really making a lot of progress on coming up with a theory of mind .
Jeff Hawkins , this morning , was describing his attempt to get theory , and a good , big theory , into the neuroscience .
And he &apos;s right . This is a problem .
Harvard Medical School once -- I was at a talk -- director of the lab said , &quot; In our lab , we have a saying .
If you work on one neuron , that &apos;s neuroscience .
If you work on two neurons , that &apos;s psychology . &quot;
We have to have more theory , and it can come as much from the top down .
Thank you very much .
Danny Hillis : The Internet could crash . We need a Plan B
In the 1970s and 1980s , a generous spirit suffused the Internet , whose users were few and far between . But today , the net is ubiquitous , connecting billions of people , machines and essential pieces of infrastructure -- leaving us vulnerable to cyber-attack or meltdown . Internet pioneer Danny Hillis argues that the Internet wasn &apos;t designed for this kind of scale , and sounds a clarion call for us to develop a Plan B : a parallel system to fall back on if -- or when -- the Internet crashes .
So , this book that I have in my hand is a directory of everybody who had an email address in 1982 .
Actually , it &apos;s deceptively large .
There &apos;s actually only about 20 people on each page , because we have the name , address and telephone number of every single person .
And , in fact , everybody &apos;s listed twice , because it &apos;s sorted once by name and once by email address .
Obviously a very small community .
There were only two other Dannys on the Internet then .
I knew them both .
We didn &apos;t all know each other , but we all kind of trusted each other , and that basic feeling of trust permeated the whole network , and there was a real sense that we could depend on each other to do things .
So just to give you an idea of the level of trust in this community , let me tell you what it was like to register a domain name in the early days .
Now , it just so happened that I got to register the third domain name on the Internet .
So I could have anything I wanted other than bbn.com and symbolics.com.
So I picked think.com , but then I thought , you know , there &apos;s a lot of really interesting names out there .
Maybe I should register a few extras just in case .
And then I thought , &quot; Nah , that wouldn &apos;t be very nice . &quot;
That attitude of only taking what you need was really what everybody had on the network in those days , and in fact , it wasn &apos;t just the people on the network , but it was actually kind of built into the protocols of the Internet itself .
So the basic idea of I.P. , or Internet protocol , and the way that the -- the routing algorithm that used it , were fundamentally &quot; from each according to their ability , to each according to their need . &quot;
And so , if you had some extra bandwidth , you &apos;d deliver a message for someone .
If they had some extra bandwidth , they would deliver a message for you .
You &apos;d kind of depend on people to do that , and that was the building block .
It was actually interesting that such a communist principle was the basis of a system developed during the Cold War by the Defense Department , but it obviously worked really well , and we all saw what happened with the Internet .
It was incredibly successful .
In fact , it was so successful that there &apos;s no way that these days you could make a book like this .
My rough calculation is it would be about 25 miles thick .
But , of course , you couldn &apos;t do it , because we don &apos;t know the names of all the people with Internet or email addresses , and even if we did know their names , I &apos;m pretty sure that they would not want their name , address and telephone number published to everyone .
So the fact is that there &apos;s a lot of bad guys on the Internet these days , and so we dealt with that by making walled communities , secure subnetworks , VPNs , little things that aren &apos;t really the Internet but are made out of the same building blocks , but we &apos;re still basically building it out of those same building blocks with those same assumptions of trust .
And that means that it &apos;s vulnerable to certain kinds of mistakes that can happen , or certain kinds of deliberate attacks , but even the mistakes can be bad .
So , for instance , in all of Asia recently , it was impossible to get YouTube for a little while because Pakistan made some mistakes in how it was censoring YouTube in its internal network .
They didn &apos;t intend to screw up Asia , but they did because of the way that the protocols work .
Another example that may have affected many of you in this audience is , you may remember a couple of years ago , all the planes west of the Mississippi were grounded because a single routing card in Salt Lake City had a bug in it .
Now , you don &apos;t really think that our airplane system depends on the Internet , and in some sense it doesn &apos;t .
I &apos;ll come back to that later .
But the fact is that people couldn &apos;t take off because something was going wrong on the Internet , and the router card was down .
And so , there are many of those things that start to happen .
Now , there was an interesting thing that happened last April .
All of a sudden , a very large percentage of the traffic on the whole Internet , including a lot of the traffic between U.S. military installations , started getting re-routed through China .
So for a few hours , it all passed through China .
Now , China Telecom says it was just an honest mistake , and it is actually possible that it was , the way things work , but certainly somebody could make a dishonest mistake of that sort if they wanted to , and it shows you how vulnerable the system is even to mistakes .
Imagine how vulnerable the system is to deliberate attacks .
So if somebody really wanted to attack the United States or Western civilization these days , they &apos;re not going to do it with tanks .
That will not succeed .
What they &apos;ll probably do is something very much like the attack that happened on the Iranian nuclear facility .
Nobody has claimed credit for that .
There was basically a factory of industrial machines .
It didn &apos;t think of itself as being on the Internet .
It thought of itself as being disconnected from the Internet , but it was possible for somebody to smuggle a USB drive in there , or something like that , and software got in there that causes the centrifuges , in that case , to actually destroy themselves .
Now that same kind of software could destroy an oil refinery or a pharmaceutical factory or a semiconductor plant .
And so there &apos;s a lot of -- I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve read a lot in papers , about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those .
But the fact is , people are mostly focused on defending the computers on the Internet , and there &apos;s been surprisingly little attention to defending the Internet itself as a communications medium .
And I think we probably do need to pay some more attention to that , because it &apos;s actually kind of fragile .
So actually , in the early days , back when it was the ARPANET , there were actually times -- there was a particular time it failed completely because one single message processor actually got a bug in it .
And the way the Internet works is the routers are basically exchanging information about how they can get messages to places , and this one processor , because of a broken card , decided it could actually get a message to some place in negative time .
So , in other words , it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it .
So of course , the fastest way to get a message anywhere was to send it to this guy , who would send it back in time and get it there super early , so every message in the Internet started getting switched through this one node , and of course that clogged everything up .
Everything started breaking .
The interesting thing was , though , that the sysadmins were able to fix it , but they had to basically turn every single thing on the Internet off .
Now , of course you couldn &apos;t do that today .
I mean , everything off , it &apos;s like the service call you get from the cable company , except for the whole world .
Now , in fact , they couldn &apos;t do it for a lot of reasons today .
One of the reasons is a lot of their telephones use IP protocol and use things like Skype and so on that go through the Internet right now , and so in fact we &apos;re becoming dependent on it for more and more different things , like when you take off from LAX , you &apos;re really not thinking you &apos;re using the Internet .
When you pump gas , you really don &apos;t think you &apos;re using the Internet .
What &apos;s happening increasingly , though , is these systems are beginning to use the Internet .
Most of them aren &apos;t based on the Internet yet , but they &apos;re starting to use the Internet for service functions , for administrative functions , and so if you take something like the cell phone system , which is still relatively independent of the Internet for the most part , Internet pieces are beginning to sneak into it in terms of some of the control and administrative functions , and it &apos;s so tempting to use these same building blocks because they work so well , they &apos;re cheap , they &apos;re repeated , and so on .
So all of our systems , more and more , are starting to use the same technology and starting to depend on this technology .
And so even a modern rocket ship these days actually uses Internet protocol to talk from one end of the rocket ship to the other .
That &apos;s crazy . It was never designed to do things like that .
So we &apos;ve built this system where we understand all the parts of it , but we &apos;re using it in a very , very different way than we expected to use it , and it &apos;s gotten a very , very different scale than it was designed for .
And in fact , nobody really exactly understands all the things it &apos;s being used for right now .
It &apos;s turning into one of these big emergent systems like the financial system , where we &apos;ve designed all the parts but nobody really exactly understands how it operates and all the little details of it and what kinds of emergent behaviors it can have .
And so if you hear an expert talking about the Internet and saying it can do this , or it does do this , or it will do that , you should treat it with the same skepticism that you might treat the comments of an economist about the economy or a weatherman about the weather , or something like that .
They have an informed opinion , but it &apos;s changing so quickly that even the experts don &apos;t know exactly what &apos;s going on .
So if you see one of these maps of the Internet , it &apos;s just somebody &apos;s guess .
Nobody really knows what the Internet is right now because it &apos;s different than it was an hour ago .
It &apos;s constantly changing . It &apos;s constantly reconfiguring .
And the problem with it is , I think we are setting ourselves up for a kind of disaster like the disaster we had in the financial system , where we take a system that &apos;s basically built on trust , was basically built for a smaller-scale system , and we &apos;ve kind of expanded it way beyond the limits of how it was meant to operate .
And so right now , I think it &apos;s literally true that we don &apos;t know what the consequences of an effective denial-of-service attack on the Internet would be , and whatever it would be is going to be worse next year , and worse next year , and so on .
But so what we need is a plan B.
There is no plan B right now .
There &apos;s no clear backup system that we &apos;ve very carefully kept to be independent of the Internet , made out of completely different sets of building blocks .
So what we need is something that doesn &apos;t necessarily have to have the performance of the Internet , but the police department has to be able to call up the fire department even without the Internet , or the hospitals have to order fuel oil .
This doesn &apos;t need to be a multi-billion-dollar government project .
It &apos;s actually relatively simple to do , technically , because it can use existing fibers that are in the ground , existing wireless infrastructure .
It &apos;s basically a matter of deciding to do it .
But people won &apos;t decide to do it until they recognize the need for it , and that &apos;s the problem that we have right now .
So there &apos;s been plenty of people , plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years , but it &apos;s very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well .
So I think that , if people understand how much we &apos;re starting to depend on the Internet , and how vulnerable it is , we could get focused on just wanting this other system to exist , and I think if enough people say , &quot; Yeah , I would like to use it , I &apos;d like to have such a system , &quot; then it will get built .
It &apos;s not that hard a problem .
It could definitely be done by people in this room .
And so I think that this is actually , of all the problems you &apos;re going to hear about at the conference , this is probably one of the very easiest to fix .
So I &apos;m happy to get a chance to tell you about it .
Thank you very much .
Stefan Larsson : What doctors can learn from each other
Different hospitals produce different results on different procedures . Only , patients don &apos;t know that data , making choosing a surgeon a high-stakes guessing game . Stefan Larsson looks at what happens when doctors measure and share their outcomes on hip replacement surgery , for example , to see which techniques are proving the most effective . Could health care get better -- and cheaper -- if doctors learn from each other in a continuous feedback loop ?
Five years ago , I was on a sabbatical , and I returned to the medical university where I studied .
I saw real patients and I wore the white coat for the first time in 17 years , in fact since I became a management consultant .
There were two things that surprised me during the month I spent .
The first one was that the common theme of the discussions we had were hospital budgets and cost-cutting , and the second thing , which really bothered me , actually , was that several of the colleagues I met , former friends from medical school , who I knew to be some of the smartest , most motivated , engaged and passionate people I &apos;d ever met , many of them had turned cynical , disengaged , or had distanced themselves from hospital management .
So with this focus on cost-cutting , I asked myself , are we forgetting the patient ?
Many countries that you represent and where I come from struggle with the cost of healthcare .
It &apos;s a big part of the national budgets .
And many different reforms aim at holding back this growth .
In some countries , we have long waiting times for patients for surgery .
In other countries , new drugs are not being reimbursed , and therefore don &apos;t reach patients .
In several countries , doctors and nurses are the targets , to some extent , for the governments .
After all , the costly decisions in health care are taken by doctors and nurses .
You choose an expensive lab test , you choose to operate on an old and frail patient .
So , by limiting the degrees of freedom of physicians , this is a way to hold costs down .
And ultimately , some physicians will say today that they don &apos;t have the full liberty to make the choices they think are right for their patients .
So no wonder that some of my old colleagues are frustrated .
At BCG , we looked at this , and we asked ourselves , this can &apos;t be the right way of managing healthcare .
And so we took a step back and we said , &quot; What is it that we are trying to achieve ? &quot;
Ultimately , in the healthcare system , we &apos;re aiming at improving health for the patients , and we need to do so at a limited , or affordable , cost .
We call this value-based healthcare .
On the screen behind me , you see what we mean by value : outcomes that matter to patients relative to the money we spend .
This was described beautifully in a book in 2006 by Michael Porter and Elizabeth Teisberg .
On this picture , you have my father-in-law surrounded by his three beautiful daughters .
When we started doing our research at BCG , we decided not to look so much at the costs , but to look at the quality instead , and in the research , one of the things that fascinated us was the variation we saw .
You compare hospitals in a country , you &apos;ll find some that are extremely good , but you &apos;ll find a large number that are vastly much worse .
The differences were dramatic .
Erik , my father-in-law , he suffers from prostate cancer , and he probably needs surgery .
Now living in Europe , he can choose to go to Germany that has a well-reputed healthcare system .
If he goes there and goes to the average hospital , he will have the risk of becoming incontinent by about 50 percent , so he would have to start wearing diapers again .
You flip a coin . Fifty percent risk . That &apos;s quite a lot .
If he instead would go to Hamburg , and to a clinic called the Martini-Klinik , the risk would be only one in 20 .
Either you a flip a coin , or you have a one in 20 risk .
That &apos;s a huge difference , a seven-fold difference .
When we look at many hospitals for many different diseases , we see these huge differences .
But you and I don &apos;t know . We don &apos;t have the data .
And often , the data actually doesn &apos;t exist .
Nobody knows .
So going the hospital is a lottery .
Now , it doesn &apos;t have to be that way . There is hope .
In the late &apos; 70s , there were a group of Swedish orthopedic surgeons who met at their annual meeting , and they were discussing the different procedures they used to operate hip surgery .
To the left of this slide , you see a variety of metal pieces , artificial hips that you would use for somebody who needs a new hip .
They all realized they had their individual way of operating .
They all argued that , &quot; My technique is the best , &quot; but none of them actually knew , and they admitted that .
So they said , &quot; We probably need to measure quality so we know and can learn from what &apos;s best . &quot;
So they in fact spent two years debating , &quot; So what is quality in hip surgery ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we should measure this . &quot; &quot; No , we should measure that . &quot;
And they finally agreed .
And once they had agreed , they started measuring , and started sharing the data .
Very quickly , they found that if you put cement in the bone of the patient before you put the metal shaft in , it actually lasted a lot longer , and most patients would never have to be re-operated on in their lifetime .
They published the data , and it actually transformed clinical practice in the country .
Everybody saw this makes a lot of sense .
Since then , they publish every year .
Once a year , they publish the league table : who &apos;s best , who &apos;s at the bottom ?
And they visit each other to try to learn , so a continuous cycle of improvement .
For many years , Swedish hip surgeons had the best results in the world , at least for those who actually were measuring , and many were not .
Now I found this principle really exciting .
So the physicians get together , they agree on what quality is , they start measuring , they share the data , they find who &apos;s best , and they learn from it .
Continuous improvement .
Now , that &apos;s not the only exciting part .
That &apos;s exciting in itself .
But if you bring back the cost side of the equation , and look at that , it turns out , those who have focused on quality , they actually also have the lowest costs , although that &apos;s not been the purpose in the first place .
So if you look at the hip surgery story again , there was a study done a couple years ago where they compared the U.S. and Sweden .
They looked at how many patients have needed to be re-operated on seven years after the first surgery .
In the United States , the number was three times higher than in Sweden .
So many unnecessary surgeries , and so much unnecessary suffering for all the patients who were operated on in that seven year period .
Now , you can imagine how much savings there would be for society .
We did a study where we looked at OECD data .
OECD does , every so often , look at quality of care where they can find the data across the member countries .
The United States has , for many diseases , actually a quality which is below the average in OECD .
Now , if the American healthcare system would focus a lot more on measuring quality , and raise quality just to the level of average OECD , it would save the American people 500 billion U.S. dollars a year .
That &apos;s 20 percent of the budget , of the healthcare budget of the country .
Now you may say that these numbers are fantastic , and it &apos;s all logical , but is it possible ?
This would be a paradigm shift in healthcare , and I would argue that not only can it be done , but it has to be done .
The agents of change are the doctors and nurses in the healthcare system .
In my practice as a consultant , I meet probably a hundred or more than a hundred doctors and nurses and other hospital or healthcare staff every year .
The one thing they have in common is they really care about what they achieve in terms of quality for their patients .
Physicians are , like most of you in the audience , very competitive .
They were always best in class .
We were always best in class .
And if somebody can show them that the result they perform for their patients is no better than what others do , they will do whatever it takes to improve .
But most of them don &apos;t know .
But physicians have another characteristic .
They actually thrive from peer recognition .
If a cardiologist calls another cardiologist in a competing hospital and discusses why that other hospital has so much better results , they will share .
They will share the information on how to improve .
So it is , by measuring and creating transparency , you get a cycle of continuous improvement , which is what this slide shows .
Now , you may say this is a nice idea , but this isn &apos;t only an idea .
This is happening in reality .
We &apos;re creating a global community , and a large global community , where we &apos;ll be able to measure and compare what we achieve .
Together with two academic institutions , Michael Porter at Harvard Business School , and the Karolinska Institute in Sweden , BCG has formed something we call ICHOM .
You may think that &apos;s a sneeze , but it &apos;s not a sneeze , it &apos;s an acronym .
It stands for the International Consortium for Health Outcome Measurement .
We &apos;re bringing together leading physicians and patients to discuss , disease by disease , what is really quality , what should we measure , and to make those standards global .
They &apos;ve worked -- four working groups have worked during the past year : cataracts , back pain , coronary artery disease , which is , for instance , heart attack , and prostate cancer .
The four groups will publish their data in November of this year .
That &apos;s the first time we &apos;ll be comparing apples to apples , not only within a country , but between countries .
Next year , we &apos;re planning to do eight diseases , the year after , 16 .
In three years &apos; time , we plan to have covered 40 percent of the disease burden .
Compare apples to apples . Who &apos;s better ?
Why is that ?
Five months ago , I led a workshop at the largest university hospital in Northern Europe .
They have a new CEO , and she has a vision : I want to manage my big institution much more on quality , outcomes that matter to patients .
This particular day , we sat in a workshop together with physicians , nurses and other staff , discussing leukemia in children .
The group discussed , how do we measure quality today ?
Can we measure it better than we do ?
We discussed , how do we treat these kids , what are important improvements ?
And we discussed what are the costs for these patients , can we do treatment more efficiently ?
There was an enormous energy in the room .
There were so many ideas , so much enthusiasm .
At the end of the meeting , the chairman of the department , he stood up .
He looked over the group and he said -- first he raised his hand , I forgot that -- he raised his hand , clenched his fist , and then he said to the group , &quot; Thank you .
Thank you . Today , we &apos;re finally discussing what this hospital does the right way . &quot;
By measuring value in healthcare , that is not only costs but outcomes that matter to patients , we will make staff in hospitals and elsewhere in the healthcare system not a problem but an important part of the solution .
I believe measuring value in healthcare will bring about a revolution , and I &apos;m convinced that the founder of modern medicine , the Greek Hippocrates , who always put the patient at the center , he would smile in his grave .
Thank you .
Brian Cox : Why we need the explorers
In tough economic times , our exploratory science programs -- from space probes to the LHC -- are first to suffer budget cuts . Brian Cox explains how curiosity-driven science pays for itself , powering innovation and a profound appreciation of our existence .
We live in difficult and challenging economic times , of course .
And one of the first victims of difficult economic times , I think , is public spending of any kind , but certainly in the firing line at the moment is public spending for science , and particularly curiosity-led science and exploration .
So I want to try and convince you in about 15 minutes that that &apos;s a ridiculous and ludicrous thing to do .
But I think to set the scene , I want to show -- the next slide is not my attempt to show the worst TED slide in the history of TED , but it is a bit of a mess .
But actually , it &apos;s not my fault ; it &apos;s from the Guardian newspaper .
And it &apos;s actually a beautiful demonstration of how much science costs .
Because , if I &apos;m going to make the case for continuing to spend on curiosity-driven science and exploration , I should tell you how much it costs .
So this is a game called &quot; spot the science budgets . &quot;
This is the U.K. government spend .
You see there , it &apos;s about 620 billion a year .
The science budget is actually -- if you look to your left , there &apos;s a purple set of blobs and then yellow set of blobs .
And it &apos;s one of the yellow set of blobs around the big yellow blob .
It &apos;s about 3.3 billion pounds per year out of 620 billion .
That funds everything in the U.K.
from medical research , space exploration , where I work , at CERN in Geneva , particle physics , engineering , even arts and humanities , funded from the science budget , which is that 3.3 billion , that little , tiny yellow blob around the orange blob at the top left of the screen .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
That percentage , by the way , is about the same in the U.S. and Germany and France .
R &amp; amp ; D in total in the economy , publicly funded , is about 0.6 percent of GDP .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re arguing about .
The first thing I want to say , and this is straight from &quot; Wonders of the Solar System , &quot; is that our exploration of the solar system and the universe has shown us that it is indescribably beautiful .
This is a picture that actually was sent back by the Cassini space probe around Saturn , after we &apos;d finished filming &quot; Wonders of the Solar System . &quot;
So it isn &apos;t in the series .
It &apos;s of the moon Enceladus .
So that big sweeping , white sphere in the corner is Saturn , which is actually in the background of the picture .
And that crescent there is the moon Enceladus , which is about as big as the British Isles .
It &apos;s about 500 kilometers in diameter .
So , tiny moon .
What &apos;s fascinating and beautiful ...
this an unprocessed picture , by the way , I should say , it &apos;s black and white , straight from Saturnian orbit .
What &apos;s beautiful is , you can probably see on the limb there some faint , sort of , wisps of almost smoke rising up from the limb .
This is how we visualize that in &quot; Wonders of the Solar System . &quot;
It &apos;s a beautiful graphic .
What we found out were that those faint wisps are actually fountains of ice rising up from the surface of this tiny moon .
That &apos;s fascinating and beautiful in itself , but we think that the mechanism for powering those fountains requires there to be lakes of liquid water beneath the surface of this moon .
And what &apos;s important about that is that , on our planet , on Earth , wherever we find liquid water , we find life .
So , to find strong evidence of liquid , pools of liquid , beneath the surface of a moon 750 million miles away from the Earth is really quite astounding .
So what we &apos;re saying , essentially , is maybe that &apos;s a habitat for life in the solar system .
Well , let me just say , that was a graphic . I just want to show this picture .
That &apos;s one more picture of Enceladus .
This is when Cassini flew beneath Enceladus .
So it made a very low pass , just a few hundred kilometers above the surface .
And so this , again , a real picture of the ice fountains rising up into space , absolutely beautiful .
But that &apos;s not the prime candidate for life in the solar system .
That &apos;s probably this place , which is a moon of Jupiter , Europa .
And again , we had to fly to the Jovian system to get any sense that this moon , as most moons , was anything other than a dead ball of rock .
It &apos;s actually an ice moon .
So what you &apos;re looking at is the surface of the moon Europa , which is a thick sheet of ice , probably a hundred kilometers thick .
But by measuring the way that Europa interacts with the magnetic field of Jupiter , and looking at how those cracks in the ice that you can see there on that graphic move around , we &apos;ve inferred very strongly that there &apos;s an ocean of liquid surrounding the entire surface of Europa .
So below the ice , there &apos;s an ocean of liquid around the whole moon .
It could be hundreds of kilometers deep , we think .
We think it &apos;s saltwater , and that would mean that there &apos;s more water on that moon of Jupiter than there is in all the oceans of the Earth combined .
So that place , a little moon around Jupiter , is probably the prime candidate for finding life on a moon or a body outside the Earth , that we know of .
Tremendous and beautiful discovery .
Our exploration of the solar system has taught us that the solar system is beautiful .
It may also have pointed the way to answering one of the most profound questions that you can possibly ask , which is : &quot; Are we alone in the universe ? &quot;
Is there any other use to exploration and science , other than just a sense of wonder ?
Well , there is .
This is a very famous picture taken , actually , on my first Christmas Eve , December 24th , 1968 , when I was about eight months old .
It was taken by Apollo 8 as it went around the back of the moon .
Earthrise from Apollo 8 .
A famous picture ; many people have said that it &apos;s the picture that saved 1968 , which was a turbulent year -- the student riots in Paris , the height of the Vietnam War .
The reason many people think that about this picture , and Al Gore has said it many times , actually , on the stage at TED , is that this picture , arguably , was the beginning of the environmental movement .
Because , for the first time , we saw our world , not as a solid , immovable , kind of indestructible place , but as a very small , fragile-looking world just hanging against the blackness of space .
What &apos;s also not often said about the space exploration , about the Apollo program , is the economic contribution it made .
I mean while you can make arguments that it was wonderful and a tremendous achievement and delivered pictures like this , it cost a lot , didn &apos;t it ?
Well , actually , many studies have been done about the economic effectiveness , the economic impact of Apollo .
The biggest one was in 1975 by Chase Econometrics .
And it showed that for every $ 1 spent on Apollo , 14 came back into the U.S. economy .
So the Apollo program paid for itself in inspiration , in engineering , achievement and , I think , in inspiring young scientists and engineers 14 times over .
So exploration can pay for itself .
What about scientific discovery ?
What about driving innovation ?
Well , this looks like a picture of virtually nothing .
What it is , is a picture of the spectrum of hydrogen .
See , back in the 1880s , 1890s , many scientists , many observers , looked at the light given off from atoms .
And they saw strange pictures like this .
What you &apos;re seeing when you put it through a prism is that you heat hydrogen up and it doesn &apos;t just glow like a white light , it just emits light at particular colors , a red one , a light blue one , some dark blue ones .
Now that led to an understanding of atomic structure because the way that &apos;s explained is atoms are a single nucleus with electrons going around them .
And the electrons can only be in particular places .
And when they jump up to the next place they can be , and fall back down again , they emit light at particular colors .
And so the fact that atoms , when you heat them up , only emit light at very specific colors , was one of the key drivers that led to the development of the quantum theory , the theory of the structure of atoms .
I just wanted to show this picture because this is remarkable .
This is actually a picture of the spectrum of the Sun .
And now , this is a picture of atoms in the Sun &apos;s atmosphere absorbing light .
And again , they only absorb light at particular colors when electrons jump up and fall down , jump up and fall down .
But look at the number of black lines in that spectrum .
And the element helium was discovered just by staring at the light from the Sun because some of those black lines were found that corresponded to no known element .
And that &apos;s why helium &apos;s called helium .
It &apos;s called &quot; helios &quot; -- helios from the Sun .
Now , that sounds esoteric , and indeed it was an esoteric pursuit , but the quantum theory quickly led to an understanding of the behaviors of electrons in materials like silicon , for example .
The way that silicon behaves , the fact that you can build transistors , is a purely quantum phenomenon .
So without that curiosity-driven understanding of the structure of atoms , which led to this rather esoteric theory , quantum mechanics , then we wouldn &apos;t have transistors , we wouldn &apos;t have silicon chips , we wouldn &apos;t have pretty much the basis of our modern economy .
There &apos;s one more , I think , wonderful twist to that tale .
In &quot; Wonders of the Solar System , &quot; we kept emphasizing the laws of physics are universal .
It &apos;s one of the most incredible things about the physics and the understanding of nature that you get on Earth , is you can transport it , not only to the planets , but to the most distant stars and galaxies .
And one of the astonishing predictions of quantum mechanics , just by looking at the structure of atoms -- the same theory that describes transistors -- is that there can be no stars in the universe that have reached the end of their life that are bigger than , quite specifically , 1.4 times the mass of the Sun .
That &apos;s a limit imposed on the mass of stars .
You can work it out on a piece of paper in a laboratory , get a telescope , swing it to the sky , and you find that there are no dead stars bigger than 1.4 times the mass of the Sun .
That &apos;s quite an incredible prediction .
What happens when you have a star that &apos;s right on the edge of that mass ?
Well , this is a picture of it .
This is the picture of a galaxy , a common &quot; our garden &quot; galaxy with , what , 100 billion stars like our Sun in it .
It &apos;s just one of billions of galaxies in the universe .
There are a billion stars in the galactic core , which is why it &apos;s shining out so brightly .
This is about 50 million light years away , so one of our neighboring galaxies .
But that bright star there is actually one of the stars in the galaxy .
So that star is also 50 million light years away .
It &apos;s part of that galaxy , and it &apos;s shining as brightly as the center of the galaxy with a billion suns in it .
That &apos;s a Type Ia supernova explosion .
Now that &apos;s an incredible phenomena , because it &apos;s a star that sits there .
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
It sits there about , say , 1.3 times the mass of the Sun .
And it has a binary companion that goes around it , so a big star , a big ball of gas .
And what it does is it sucks gas off its companion star , until it gets to this limit called the Chandrasekhar limit , and then it explodes .
And it explodes , and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks , and releases , not only energy , but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe .
In fact , that one is a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
Now , there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe at the Big Bang .
And there was no carbon and oxygen in the universe throughout the first generation of stars .
It was made in stars like that , locked away and then returned to the universe in explosions like that in order to recondense into planets , stars , new solar systems and , indeed , people like us .
I think that &apos;s a remarkable demonstration of the power and beauty and universality of the laws of physics , because we understand that process , because we understand the structure of atoms here on Earth .
This is a beautiful quote that I found -- we &apos;re talking about serendipity there -- from Alexander Fleming : &quot; When I woke up just after dawn on September 28 , 1928 , I certainly didn &apos;t plan to revolutionize all medicine by discovering the world &apos;s first antibiotic . &quot;
Now , the explorers of the world of the atom did not intend to invent the transistor .
And they certainly didn &apos;t intend to describe the mechanics of supernova explosions , which eventually told us where the building blocks of life were synthesized in the universe .
So , I think science can be -- serendipity is important .
It can be beautiful . It can reveal quite astonishing things .
It can also , I think , finally reveal the most profound ideas to us about our place in the universe and really the value of our home planet .
This is a spectacular picture of our home planet .
Now , it doesn &apos;t look like our home planet .
It looks like Saturn because , of course , it is .
It was taken by the Cassini space probe .
But it &apos;s a famous picture , not because of the beauty and majesty of Saturn &apos;s rings , but actually because of a tiny , faint blob just hanging underneath one of the rings .
And if I blow it up there , you see it .
It looks like a moon , but in fact , it &apos;s a picture of Earth .
It was a picture of Earth captured in that frame of Saturn .
That &apos;s our planet from 750 million miles away .
I think the Earth has got a strange property that the farther away you get from it , the more beautiful it seems .
But that is not the most distant or most famous picture of our planet .
It was taken by this thing , which is called the Voyager spacecraft .
And that &apos;s a picture of me in front of it for scale .
The Voyager is a tiny machine .
It &apos;s currently 10 billion miles away from Earth , transmitting with that dish , with the power of 20 watts , and we &apos;re still in contact with it .
But it visited Jupiter , Saturn , Uranus and Neptune .
And after it visited all four of those planets , Carl Sagan , who &apos;s one of my great heroes , had the wonderful idea of turning Voyager around and taking a picture of every planet it had visited .
And it took this picture of Earth .
Now it &apos;s very hard to see the Earth there , it &apos;s called the &quot; Pale Blue Dot &quot; picture , but Earth is suspended in that red shaft of light .
That &apos;s Earth from four billion miles away .
And I &apos;d like to read you what Sagan wrote about it , just to finish , because I cannot say words as beautiful as this to describe what he saw in that picture that he had taken .
He said , &quot; Consider again that dot .
That &apos;s here . That &apos;s home . That &apos;s us .
On it , everyone you love , everyone you know , everyone you &apos;ve ever heard of , every human being who ever was lived out their lives .
The aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there , on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam .
It &apos;s been said that astronomy &apos;s a humbling and character-building experience .
There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits than this distant image of our tiny world .
To me , it underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot , the only home we &apos;ve ever known . &quot;
Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration .
The argument has always been made , and it will always be made , that we know enough about the universe .
You could have made it in the 1920s ; you wouldn &apos;t have had penicillin .
You could have made it in the 1890s ; you wouldn &apos;t have the transistor .
And it &apos;s made today in these difficult economic times .
Surely , we know enough .
We don &apos;t need to discover anything else about our universe .
Let me leave the last words to someone who &apos;s rapidly becoming a hero of mine , Humphrey Davy , who did his science at the turn of the 19th century .
He was clearly under assault all the time .
&quot; We know enough at the turn of the 19th century .
Just exploit it ; just build things . &quot;
He said this , he said , &quot; Nothing is more fatal to the progress of the human mind than to presume that our views of science are ultimate , that our triumphs are complete , that there are no mysteries in nature , and that there are no new worlds to conquer . &quot;
Thank you .
Janna Levin : The sound the universe makes
We think of space as a silent place . But physicist Janna Levin says the universe has a soundtrack -- a sonic composition that records some of the most dramatic events in outer space . An accessible and mind-expanding soundwalk through the universe .
I want to ask you all to consider for a second the very simple fact that , by far , most of what we know about the universe comes to us from light .
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes .
The Sun burns our peripheral vision .
We see light reflected off the Moon .
And in the time since Galileo pointed that rudimentary telescope at the celestial bodies , the known universe has come to us through light , across vast eras in cosmic history .
And with all of our modern telescopes , we &apos;ve been able to collect this stunning silent movie of the universe -- these series of snapshots that go all the way back to the Big Bang .
And yet , the universe is not a silent movie because the universe isn &apos;t silent .
I &apos;d like to convince you that the universe has a soundtrack and that soundtrack is played on space itself , because space can wobble like a drum .
It can ring out a kind of recording throughout the universe of some of the most dramatic events as they unfold .
Now we &apos;d like to be able to add to a kind of glorious visual composition that we have of the universe -- a sonic composition .
And while we &apos;ve never heard the sounds from space , we really should , in the next few years , start to turn up the volume on what &apos;s going on out there .
So in this ambition to capture songs from the universe , we turn our focus to black holes and the promise they have , because black holes can bang on space-time like mallets on a drum and have a very characteristic song , which I &apos;d like to play for you -- some of our predictions for what that song will be like .
Now black holes are dark against a dark sky .
We can &apos;t see them directly .
They &apos;re not brought to us with light , at least not directly .
We can see them indirectly , because black holes wreak havoc on their environment .
They destroy stars around them .
They churn up debris in their surroundings .
But they won &apos;t come to us directly through light .
We might one day see a shadow a black hole can cast on a very bright background , but we haven &apos;t yet .
And yet black holes may be heard even if they &apos;re not seen , and that &apos;s because they bang on space-time like a drum .
Now we owe the idea that space can ring like a drum to Albert Einstein -- to whom we owe so much .
Einstein realized that if space were empty , if the universe were empty , it would be like this picture , except for maybe without the helpful grid drawn on it .
But if we were freely falling through the space , even without this helpful grid , we might be able to paint it ourselves , because we would notice that we traveled along straight lines , undeflected straight paths through the universe .
Einstein also realized -- and this is the real meat of the matter -- that if you put energy or mass in the universe , it would curve space , and a freely falling object would pass by , let &apos;s say , the Sun and it would be deflected along the natural curves in the space .
It was Einstein &apos;s great general theory of relativity .
Now even light will be bent by those paths .
And you can be bent so much that you &apos;re caught in orbit around the Sun , as the Earth is , or the Moon around the Earth .
These are the natural curves in space .
What Einstein did not realize was that , if you took our Sun and you crushed it down to six kilometers -- so you took a million times the mass of the Earth and you crushed it to six kilometers across , you would make a black hole , an object so dense that if light veered too close , it would never escape -- a dark shadow against the universe .
It wasn &apos;t Einstein who realized this , it was Karl Schwarzschild who was a German Jew in World War I -- joined the German army already an accomplished scientist , working on the Russian front .
I like to imagine Schwarzschild in the war in the trenches calculating ballistic trajectories for cannon fire , and then , in between , calculating Einstein &apos;s equations -- as you do in the trenches .
And he was reading Einstein &apos;s recently published general theory of relativity , and he was thrilled by this theory .
And he quickly surmised an exact mathematical solution that described something very extraordinary : curves so strong that space would rain down into them , space itself would curve like a waterfall flowing down the throat of a hole .
And even light could not escape this current .
Light would be dragged down the hole as everything else would be , and all that would be left would be a shadow .
Now he wrote to Einstein , and he said , &quot; As you will see , the war has been kind to me enough .
Despite the heavy gunfire , I &apos;ve been able to get away from it all and walk through the land of your ideas . &quot;
And Einstein was very impressed with his exact solution , and I should hope also the dedication of the scientist .
This is the hardworking scientist under harsh conditions .
And he took Schwarzschild &apos;s idea to the Prussian Academy of Sciences the next week .
But Einstein always thought black holes were a mathematical oddity .
He did not believe they existed in nature .
He thought nature would protect us from their formation .
It was decades before the term &quot; black hole &quot; was coined and people realized that black holes are real astrophysical objects -- in fact they &apos;re the death state of very massive stars that collapse catastrophically at the end of their lifetime .
Now our Sun will not collapse to a black hole .
It &apos;s actually not massive enough .
But if we did a little thought experiment -- as Einstein was very fond of doing -- we could imagine putting the Sun crushed down to six kilometers , and putting a tiny little Earth around it in orbit , maybe 30 kilometers outside of the black-hole sun .
And it would be self-illuminated , because now the Sun &apos;s gone , we have no other source of light -- so let &apos;s make our little Earth self-illuminated .
And you would realize you could put the Earth in a happy orbit even 30 km outside of this crushed black hole .
This crushed black hole actually would fit inside Manhattan , more or less .
It might spill off into the Hudson a little bit before it destroyed the Earth .
But basically that &apos;s what we &apos;re talking about .
We &apos;re talking about an object that you could crush down to half the square area of Manhattan .
So we move this Earth very close -- 30 kilometers outside -- and we notice it &apos;s perfectly fine orbiting around the black hole .
There &apos;s a sort of myth that black holes devour everything in the universe , but you actually have to get very close to fall in .
But what &apos;s very impressive is that , from our vantage point , we can always see the Earth .
It cannot hide behind the black hole .
The light from the Earth , some of it falls in , but some of it gets lensed around and brought back to us .
So you can &apos;t hide anything behind a black hole .
If this were Battlestar Galactica and you &apos;re fighting the Cylons , don &apos;t hide behind the black hole .
They can see you .
Now , our Sun will not collapse to a black hole -- it &apos;s not massive enough -- but there are tens of thousands of black holes in our galaxy .
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way , this is what it would look like .
We would see a shadow of that black hole against the hundred billion stars in the Milky Way Galaxy and its luminous dust lanes .
And if we were to fall towards this black hole , we would see all of that light lensed around it , and we could even start to cross into that shadow and really not notice that anything dramatic had happened .
It would be bad if we tried to fire our rockets and get out of there because we couldn &apos;t , anymore than light can escape .
But even though the black hole is dark from the outside , it &apos;s not dark on the inside , because all of the light from the galaxy can fall in behind us .
And even though , due to a relativistic effect known as time dilation , our clocks would seem to slow down relative to galactic time , it would look as though the evolution of the galaxy had been sped up and shot at us , right before we were crushed to death by the black hole .
It would be like a near-death experience where you see the light at the end of the tunnel , but it &apos;s a total death experience .
And there &apos;s no way of telling anybody about the light at the end of the tunnel .
Now we &apos;ve never seen a shadow like this of a black hole , but black holes can be heard , even if they &apos;re not seen .
Imagine now taking an astrophysically realistic situation -- imagine two black holes that have lived a long life together .
Maybe they started as stars and collapsed to two black holes -- each one 10 times the mass of the Sun .
So now we &apos;re going to crush them down to 60 kilometers across .
They can be spinning hundreds of times a second .
At the end of their lives , they &apos;re going around each other very near the speed of light .
So they &apos;re crossing thousands of kilometers in a fraction of a second , and as they do so , they not only curve space , but they leave behind in their wake a ringing of space , an actual wave on space-time .
Space squeezes and stretches as it emanates out from these black holes banging on the universe .
And they travel out into the cosmos at the speed of light .
This computer simulation is due to a relativity group at NASA Goddard .
It took almost 30 years for anyone in the world to crack this problem .
This was one of the groups .
It shows two black holes in orbit around each other , again , with these helpfully painted curves .
And if you can see -- it &apos;s kind of faint -- but if you can see the red waves emanating out , those are the gravitational waves .
They &apos;re literally the sounds of space ringing , and they will travel out from these black holes at the speed of light as they ring down and coalesce to one spinning , quiet black hole at the end of the day .
If you were standing near enough , your ear would resonate with the squeezing and stretching of space .
You would literally hear the sound .
Now of course , your head would be squeezed and stretched unhelpfully , so you might have trouble understanding what &apos;s going on .
But I &apos;d like to play for you the sound that we predict .
This is from my group -- a slightly less glamorous computer modeling .
Imagine a lighter black hole falling into a very heavy black hole .
The sound you &apos;re hearing is the light black hole banging on space each time it gets close .
If it gets far away , it &apos;s a little too quiet .
But it comes in like a mallet , and it literally cracks space , wobbling it like a drum .
And we can predict what the sound will be .
We know that , as it falls in , it gets faster and it gets louder .
And eventually , we &apos;re going to hear the little guy just fall into the bigger guy .
Then it &apos;s gone .
Now I &apos;ve never heard it that loud -- it &apos;s actually more dramatic .
At home it sounds kind of anticlimactic .
It &apos;s sort of like ding , ding , ding .
This is another sound from my group .
No , I &apos;m not showing you any images , because black holes don &apos;t leave behind helpful trails of ink , and space is not painted , showing you the curves .
But if you were to float by in space on a space holiday and you heard this , you want to get moving .
Want to get away from the sound .
Both black holes are moving .
Both black holes are getting closer together .
In this case , they &apos;re both wobbling quite a lot .
And then they &apos;re going to merge .
Now it &apos;s gone .
Now that chirp is very characteristic of black holes merging -- that it chirps up at the end .
Now that &apos;s our prediction for what we &apos;ll see .
Luckily we &apos;re at this safe distance in Long Beach , California .
And surely , somewhere in the universe two black holes have merged .
And surely , the space around us is ringing after traveling maybe a million light years , or a million years , at the speed of light to get to us .
But the sound is too quiet for any of us to ever hear .
There are very industrious experiments being built on Earth -- one called LIGO -- which will detect deviations in the squeezing and stretching of space at less than the fraction of a nucleus of an atom over four kilometers .
It &apos;s a remarkably ambitious experiment , and it &apos;s going to be at advanced sensitivity within the next few years -- to pick this up .
There &apos;s also a mission proposed for space , which hopefully will launch in the next ten years , called LISA .
And LISA will be able to see super-massive black holes -- black holes millions or billions of times the mass of the Sun .
In this Hubble image , we see two galaxies .
They look like they &apos;re frozen in some embrace .
And each one probably harbors a super-massive black hole at its core .
But they &apos;re not frozen ; they &apos;re actually merging .
These two black holes are colliding , and they will merge over a billion-year time scale .
It &apos;s beyond our human perception to pick up a song of that duration .
But LISA could see the final stages of two super-massive black holes earlier in the universe &apos;s history , the last 15 minutes before they fall together .
And it &apos;s not just black holes , but it &apos;s also any big disturbance in the universe -- and the biggest of them all is the Big Bang .
When that expression was coined , it was derisive -- like , &quot; Oh , who would believe in a Big Bang ? &quot;
But now it actually might be more technically accurate because it might bang .
It might make a sound .
This animation from my friends at Proton Studios shows looking at the Big Bang from the outside .
We don &apos;t ever want to do that actually . We want to be inside the universe because there &apos;s no such thing as standing outside the universe .
So imagine you &apos;re inside the Big Bang .
It &apos;s everywhere , it &apos;s all around you , and the space is wobbling chaotically .
Fourteen billion years pass and this song is still ringing all around us .
Galaxies form , and generations of stars form in those galaxies , and around one star , at least one star , is a habitable planet .
And here we are frantically building these experiments , doing these calculations , writing these computer codes .
Imagine a billion years ago , two black holes collided .
That song has been ringing through space for all that time .
We weren &apos;t even here .
It gets closer and closer -- 40,000 years ago , we &apos;re still doing cave paintings .
It &apos;s like hurry , build your instruments .
It &apos;s getting closer and closer , and in 20 ...
whatever year it will be when our detectors are finally at advanced sensitivity -- we &apos;ll build them , we &apos;ll turn on the machines and , bang , we &apos;ll catch it -- the first song from space .
If it was the Big Bang we were going to pick up , it would sound like this .
It &apos;s a terrible sound .
It &apos;s literally the definition of noise .
It &apos;s white noise ; it &apos;s such a chaotic ringing .
But it &apos;s around us everywhere , presumably , if it hasn &apos;t been wiped out by some other process in the universe .
And if we pick it up , it will be music to our ears because it will be the quiet echo of that moment of our creation , of our observable universe .
So within the next few years , we &apos;ll be able to turn up the soundtrack a little bit , render the universe in audio .
But if we detect those earliest moments , it &apos;ll bring us that much closer to an understanding of the Big Bang , which brings us that much closer to asking some of the hardest , most elusive , questions .
If we run the movie of our universe backwards , we know that there was a Big Bang in our past , and we might even hear the cacophonous sound of it , but was our Big Bang the only Big Bang ?
I mean we have to ask , has it happened before ?
Will it happen again ?
I mean , in the spirit of rising to TED &apos;s challenge to reignite wonder , we can ask questions , at least for this last minute , that honestly might evade us forever .
But we have to ask : Is it possible that our universe is just a plume off of some greater history ?
Or , is it possible that we &apos;re just a branch off of a multiverse -- each branch with its own Big Bang in its past -- maybe some of them with black holes playing drums , maybe some without -- maybe some with sentient life , and maybe some without -- not in our past , not in our future , but somehow fundamentally connected to us ?
So we have to wonder , if there is a multiverse , in some other patch of that multiverse , are there creatures ?
Here &apos;s my multiverse creatures .
Are there other creatures in the multiverse , wondering about us and wondering about their own origins ?
And if they are , I can imagine them as we are , calculating , writing computer code , building instruments , trying to detect that faintest sound of their origins and wondering who else is out there .
Thank you . Thank you .
Joe Kowan : How I beat stage fright
Humanity &apos;s fine-tuned sense of fear served us well as a young species , giving us laser focus to avoid being eaten by competing beasts . But it &apos;s less wonderful when that same visceral , body-hijacking sense of fear kicks in in front of 20 folk-music fans at a Tuesday night open-mic . Palms sweat , hands shake , vision blurs , and the brain says RUN : it &apos;s stage fright . In this charming , tuneful little talk , Joe Kowan talks about how he conquered it .
Joe Kowan : I have stage fright .
I &apos;ve always had stage fright , and not just a little bit , it &apos;s a big bit .
And it didn &apos;t even matter until I was 27 .
That &apos;s when I started writing songs , and even then I only played them for myself .
Just knowing my roommates were in the same house made me uncomfortable .
But after a couple of years , just writing songs wasn &apos;t enough .
I had all these stories and ideas , and I wanted to share them with people , but physiologically , I couldn &apos;t do it .
I had this irrational fear .
But the more I wrote , and the more I practiced , the more I wanted to perform .
So on the week of my 30th birthday , I decided I was going to go to this local open mic , and put this fear behind me .
Well , when I got there , it was packed .
There were like 20 people there .
And they all looked angry .
But I took a deep breath , and I signed up to play , and I felt pretty good .
Pretty good , until about 10 minutes before my turn , when my whole body rebelled , and this wave of anxiety just washed over me .
Now , when you experience fear , your sympathetic nervous system kicks in .
So you have a rush of adrenaline , your heart rate increases , your breathing gets faster .
Next your non-essential systems start to shut down , like digestion .
So your mouth gets dry , and blood is routed away from your extremities , so your fingers don &apos;t work anymore .
Your pupils dilate , your muscles contract , your Spidey sense tingles , basically your whole body is trigger-happy .
That condition is not conducive to performing folk music .
I mean , your nervous system is an idiot .
Really ? Two hundred thousand years of human evolution , and it still can &apos;t tell the difference between a saber tooth tiger and 20 folksingers on a Tuesday night open mic ?
I have never been more terrified -- until now .
So then it was my turn , and somehow , I get myself onto the stage , I start my song , I open my mouth to sing the first line , and this completely horrible vibrato -- you know , when your voice wavers -- comes streaming out .
And this is not the good kind of vibrato , like an opera singer has , this is my whole body just convulsing with fear .
I mean , it &apos;s a nightmare .
I &apos;m embarrassed , the audience is clearly uncomfortable , they &apos;re focused on my discomfort .
It was so bad .
But that was my first real experience as a solo singer-songwriter .
And something good did happen -- I had the tiniest little glimpse of that audience connection that I was hoping for .
And I wanted more . But I knew I had to get past this nervousness .
That night I promised myself : I would go back every week until I wasn &apos;t nervous anymore .
And I did . I went back every single week , and sure enough , week after week , it didn &apos;t get any better . The same thing happened every week .
I couldn &apos;t shake it .
And that &apos;s when I had an epiphany .
And I remember it really well , because I don &apos;t have a lot of epiphanies .
All I had to do was write a song that exploits my nervousness .
That only seems authentic when I have stage fright , and the more nervous I was , the better the song would be . Easy .
So I started writing a song about having stage fright .
First , fessing up to the problem , the physical manifestations , how I would feel , how the listener might feel .
And then accounting for things like my shaky voice , and I knew I would be singing about a half-octave higher than normal , because I was nervous .
By having a song that explained what was happening to me , while it was happening , that gave the audience permission to think about it .
They didn &apos;t have to feel bad for me because I was nervous , they could experience that with me , and we were all one big happy , nervous , uncomfortable family .
By thinking about my audience , by embracing and exploiting my problem , I was able to take something that was blocking my progress , and turn it into something that was essential for my success .
And having the stage fright song let me get past that biggest issue right in the beginning of a performance .
And then I could move on , and play the rest of my songs with just a little bit more ease .
And eventually , over time , I didn &apos;t have to play the stage fright song at all .
Except for when I was really nervous , like now .
Would it be okay if I played the stage fright song for you ?
Can I have a sip of water ?
Thank you .
I &apos;m not joking , you know , this stage fright is real . And if I &apos;m up here trembling and singing , well , you &apos;ll know how I feel . And the mistake I &apos;d be making , the tremolo caused by my whole body shaking . As you sit there feeling embarrassed for me , well , you don &apos;t have to be . Well , maybe just a little bit . And maybe I &apos;ll try to imagine you all without clothes . But singing in front of all naked strangers scares me more than anyone knows . Not to discuss this at length , but my body image was never my strength . So frankly , I wish that you all would get dressed , I mean , you &apos;re not even really naked . And I &apos;m the one with the problem . And you tell me , don &apos;t worry so much , you &apos;ll be great . But I &apos;m the one living with me and I know how I get . Your advice is gentle but late . If not just a bit patronizing . And that sarcastic tone doesn &apos;t help me when I sing . But we shouldn &apos;t talk about these things right now , really , I &apos;m up on stage , and you &apos;re in the crowd . Hi . And I &apos;m not making fun of unnurtured , irrrational fear , and if I wasn &apos;t ready to face this , I sure as hell wouldn &apos;t be here . But if I belt one note out clearly , you &apos;ll know I &apos;m recovering slowly but surely . And maybe next week , I &apos;ll set my guitar ringin &apos; my voice clear as water , and everyone singin &apos; . But probably I &apos;ll just get up and start groovin &apos; , my vocal cords movin &apos; , at speeds slightly faster than sound .
Alan Kay : A powerful idea about ideas
With all the intensity and brilliance for which he is known , Alan Kay envisions better techniques for teaching kids by using computers to illustrate experience in ways - ‚Äì mathematically and scientifically -- that only computers can .
A great way to start , I think , with my view of simplicity is to take a look at TED . Here you are , understanding why we &apos;re here , what &apos;s going on with no difficulty at all .
The best A.I. in the planet would find it complex and confusing , and my little dog Watson would find it simple and understandable but would miss the point .
He would have a great time .
And of course , if you &apos;re a speaker here , like Hans Rosling , a speaker finds this complex , tricky . But in Hans Rosling &apos;s case , he had a secret weapon yesterday , literally , in his sword swallowing act .
And I must say , I thought of quite a few objects that I might try to swallow today and finally gave up on , but he just did it and that was a wonderful thing .
So Puck meant not only are we fools in the pejorative sense , but that we &apos;re easily fooled . In fact , what Shakespeare was pointing out is we go to the theater in order to be fooled , so we &apos;re actually looking forward to it .
We go to magic shows in order to be fooled .
And this makes many things fun , but it makes it difficult to actually get any kind of picture on the world we live in or on ourselves .
And our friend , Betty Edwards , the &quot; Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain &quot; lady , shows these two tables to her drawing class and says , &quot; The problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can &apos;t move your hand , but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty .
It &apos;s trying to perceive images into objects rather than seeing what &apos;s there . &quot;
And to prove it , she says , &quot; The exact size and shape of these tabletops is the same , and I &apos;m going to prove it to you . &quot;
She does this with cardboard , but since I have an expensive computer here I &apos;ll just rotate this little guy around and ...
Now having seen that -- and I &apos;ve seen it hundreds of times , because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can &apos;t see that they &apos;re the same size and shape , and I doubt that you can either .
So what do artists do ? Well , what artists do is to measure .
They measure very , very carefully .
And if you measure very , very carefully with a stiff arm and a straight edge , you &apos;ll see that those two shapes are exactly the same size .
And the Talmud saw this a long time ago , saying , &quot; We see things not as they are , but as we are . &quot;
I certainly would like to know what happened to the person who had that insight back then , if they actually followed it to its ultimate conclusion .
So if the world is not as it seems and we see things as we are , then what we call reality is a kind of hallucination happening inside here . It &apos;s a waking dream , and understanding that that is what we actually exist in is one of the biggest epistemological barriers in human history .
And what that means : &quot; simple and understandable &quot; might not be actually simple or understandable , and things we think are &quot; complex &quot; might be made simple and understandable .
Somehow we have to understand ourselves to get around our flaws .
We can think of ourselves as kind of a noisy channel .
The way I think of it is , we can &apos;t learn to see until we admit we &apos;re blind .
Once you start down at this very humble level , then you can start finding ways to see things .
And what &apos;s happened , over the last 400 years in particular , is that human beings have invented &quot; brainlets &quot; -- little additional parts for our brain -- made out of powerful ideas that help us see the world in different ways .
And these are in the form of sensory apparatus -- telescopes , microscopes -- reasoning apparatus -- various ways of thinking -- and , most importantly , in the ability to change perspective on things .
I &apos;ll talk about that a little bit .
It &apos;s this change in perspective on what it is we think we &apos;re perceiving that has helped us make more progress in the last 400 years than we have in the rest of human history .
And yet , it is not taught in any K through 12 curriculum in America that I &apos;m aware of .
So one of the things that goes from simple to complex is when we do more . We like more .
If we do more in a kind of a stupid way , the simplicity gets complex and , in fact , we can keep on doing it for a very long time .
But Murray Gell-Mann yesterday talked about emergent properties ; another name for them could be &quot; architecture &quot; as a metaphor for taking the same old material and thinking about non-obvious , non-simple ways of combining it .
And in fact , what Murray was talking about yesterday in the fractal beauty of nature -- of having the descriptions at various levels be rather similar -- all goes down to the idea that the elementary particles are both sticky and standoffish , and they &apos;re in violent motion .
Those three things give rise to all the different levels of what seem to be complexity in our world .
But how simple ?
So , when I saw Roslings &apos; Gapminder stuff a few years ago , I just thought it was the greatest thing I &apos;d seen in conveying complex ideas simply .
But then I had a thought of , &quot; Boy , maybe it &apos;s too simple . &quot;
And I put some effort in to try and check to see how well these simple portrayals of trends over time actually matched up with some ideas and investigations from the side , and I found that they matched up very well .
So the Roslings have been able to do simplicity without removing what &apos;s important about the data .
Whereas the film yesterday that we saw of the simulation of the inside of a cell , as a former molecular biologist , I didn &apos;t like that at all .
Not because it wasn &apos;t beautiful or anything , but because it misses the thing that most students fail to understand about molecular biology , and that is : why is there any probability at all of two complex shapes finding each other just the right way so they combine together and be catalyzed ?
And what we saw yesterday was every reaction was fortuitous ; they just swooped in the air and bound , and something happened .
But in fact , those molecules are spinning at the rate of about a million revolutions per second ; they &apos;re agitating back and forth their size every two nanoseconds ; they &apos;re completely crowded together , they &apos;re jammed , they &apos;re bashing up against each other .
And if you don &apos;t understand that in your mental model of this stuff , what happens inside of a cell seems completely mysterious and fortuitous , and I think that &apos;s exactly the wrong image for when you &apos;re trying to teach science .
So , another thing that we do is to confuse adult sophistication with the actual understanding of some principle .
So a kid who &apos;s 14 in high school gets this version of the Pythagorean theorem , which is a truly subtle and interesting proof , but in fact it &apos;s not a good way to start learning about mathematics .
So a more direct one , one that gives you more of the feeling of math , is something closer to Pythagoras &apos; own proof , which goes like this : so here we have this triangle , and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that , notice that we can move those triangles down like this .
And that leaves two open areas that are kind of suspicious ...
and bingo . That is all you have to do .
And this kind of proof is the kind of proof that you need to learn when you &apos;re learning mathematics in order to get an idea of what it means before you look into the , literally , 1,200 or 1,500 proofs of Pythagoras &apos; theorem that have been discovered .
Now let &apos;s go to young children .
This is a very unusual teacher who was a kindergarten and first-grade teacher , but was a natural mathematician .
So she was like that jazz musician friend you have who never studied music but is a terrific musician ; she just had a feeling for math .
And here are her six-year-olds , and she &apos;s got them making shapes out of a shape .
So they pick a shape they like -- like a diamond , or a square , or a triangle , or a trapezoid -- and then they try and make the next larger shape of that same shape , and the next larger shape .
You can see the trapezoids are a little challenging there .
And what this teacher did on every project was to have the children act like first it was a creative arts project , and then something like science .
So they had created these artifacts .
Now she had them look at them and do this ... laborious , which I thought for a long time , until she explained to me was to slow them down so they &apos;ll think .
So they &apos;re cutting out the little pieces of cardboard here and pasting them up .
But the whole point of this thing is for them to look at this chart and fill it out .
&quot; What have you noticed about what you did ? &quot;
And so six-year-old Lauren there noticed that the first one took one , and the second one took three more and the total was four on that one , the third one took five more and the total was nine on that one , and then the next one .
She saw right away that the additional tiles that you had to add around the edges was always going to grow by two , so she was very confident about how she made those numbers there .
And she could see that these were the square numbers up until about six , where she wasn &apos;t sure what six times six was and what seven times seven was , but then she was confident again .
So that &apos;s what Lauren did .
And then the teacher , Gillian Ishijima , had the kids bring all of their projects up to the front of the room and put them on the floor , and everybody went batshit : &quot; Holy shit ! They &apos;re the same ! &quot;
No matter what the shapes were , the growth law is the same .
And the mathematicians and scientists in the crowd will recognize these two progressions as a first-order discrete differential equation and a second-order discrete differential equation , derived by six-year-olds .
Well , that &apos;s pretty amazing .
That isn &apos;t what we usually try to teach six-year-olds .
So , let &apos;s take a look now at how we might use the computer for some of this .
And so the first idea here is just to show you the kind of things that children do .
I &apos;m using the software that we &apos;re putting on the $ 100 laptop .
So I &apos;d like to draw a little car here -- I &apos;ll just do this very quickly -- and put a big tire on him .
And I get a little object here and I can look inside this object , I &apos;ll call it a car . And here &apos;s a little behavior : car forward .
Each time I click it , car turn .
If I want to make a little script to do this over and over again , I just drag these guys out and set them going .
And I can try steering the car here by ...
See the car turn by five here ?
So what if I click this down to zero ?
It goes straight . That &apos;s a big revelation for nine-year-olds .
Make it go in the other direction .
But of course , that &apos;s a little bit like kissing your sister as far as driving a car , so the kids want to do a steering wheel ; so they draw a steering wheel .
And we &apos;ll call this a wheel .
See this wheel &apos;s heading here ?
If I turn this wheel , you can see that number over there going minus and positive .
That &apos;s kind of an invitation to pick up this name of those numbers coming out there and to just drop it into the script here , and now I can steer the car with the steering wheel .
And it &apos;s interesting .
You know how much trouble the children have with variables , but by learning it this way , in a situated fashion , they never forget from this single trial what a variable is and how to use it .
And we can reflect here the way Gillian Ishijima did .
So if you look at the little script here , the speed is always going to be 30 .
We &apos;re going to move the car according to that over and over again .
And I &apos;m dropping a little dot for each one of these things ; they &apos;re evenly spaced because they &apos;re 30 apart .
And what if I do this progression that the six-year-olds did of saying , &quot; OK , I &apos;m going to increase the speed by two each time , and then I &apos;m going to increase the distance by the speed each time ?
What do I get there ? &quot;
We get a visual pattern of what these nine-year-olds called acceleration .
So how do the children do science ?
Teacher : &#91; Choose &#93; objects that you think will fall to the Earth at the same time .
Student 1 : Ooh , this is nice .
Teacher : Do not pay any attention to what anybody else is doing .
Who &apos;s got the apple ?
Alan Kay : They &apos;ve got little stopwatches .
Student 2 : What did you get ? What did you get ?
AK : Stopwatches aren &apos;t accurate enough .
Student 3 : 0.99 seconds .
Teacher : So put &quot; sponge ball &quot; ...
Student 4l : &#91; I decided to &#93; do the shot put and the sponge ball because they &apos;re two totally different weights , and if you drop them at the same time , maybe they &apos;ll drop at the same speed .
Teacher : Drop . Class : Whoa !
AK : So obviously , Aristotle never asked a child about this particular point because , of course , he didn &apos;t bother doing the experiment , and neither did St. Thomas Aquinas .
And it was not until Galileo actually did it that an adult thought like a child , only 400 years ago .
We get one child like that about every classroom of 30 kids who will actually cut straight to the chase .
Now , what if we want to look at this more closely ?
We can take a movie of what &apos;s going on , but even if we single stepped this movie , it &apos;s tricky to see what &apos;s going on .
And so what we can do is we can lay out the frames side by side or stack them up .
So when the children see this , they say , &quot; Ah ! Acceleration , &quot; remembering back four months when they did their cars sideways , and they start measuring to find out what kind of acceleration it is .
So what I &apos;m doing is measuring from the bottom of one image to the bottom of the next image , about a fifth of a second later , like that . And they &apos;re getting faster and faster each time , and if I stack these guys up , then we see the differences ; the increase in the speed is constant .
And they say , &quot; Oh , yeah . Constant acceleration .
We &apos;ve done that already . &quot;
And how shall we look and verify that we actually have it ?
So you can &apos;t tell much from just making the ball drop there , but if we drop the ball and run the movie at the same time , we can see that we have come up with an accurate physical model .
Galileo , by the way , did this very cleverly by running a ball backwards down the strings of his lute .
I pulled out those apples to remind myself to tell you that this is actually probably a Newton and the apple type story , but it &apos;s a great story .
And I thought I would do just one thing on the $ 100 laptop here just to prove that this stuff works here .
So once you have gravity , here &apos;s this -- increase the speed by something , increase the ship &apos;s speed .
If I start the little game here that the kids have done , it &apos;ll crash the space ship .
But if I oppose gravity , here we go ... Oops !
One more .
I guess the best way to end this is with two quotes : Marshall McLuhan said , &quot; Children are the messages that we send to the future , &quot; but in fact , if you think of it , children are the future we send to the future .
Forget about messages ; children are the future , and children in the first and second world and , most especially , in the third world need mentors .
And this summer , we &apos;re going to build five million of these $ 100 laptops , and maybe 50 million next year .
But we couldn &apos;t create 1,000 new teachers this summer to save our life .
That means that we , once again , have a thing where we can put technology out , but the mentoring that is required to go from a simple new iChat instant messaging system to something with depth is missing .
I believe this has to be done with a new kind of user interface , and this new kind of user interface could be done with an expenditure of about 100 million dollars .
It sounds like a lot , but it is literally 18 minutes of what we &apos;re spending in Iraq -- we &apos;re spending 8 billion dollars a month ; 18 minutes is 100 million dollars -- so this is actually cheap .
And Einstein said , &quot; Things should be as simple as possible , but not simpler . &quot;
Thank you .
Rives : If I controlled the Internet
How many poets could cram eBay , Friendster and Monster.com into 3-minute poem worthy of a standing ovation ? Enjoy Rives &apos; unique talent .
I wrote this poem after hearing a pretty well known actress tell a very well known interviewer on television , &quot; I &apos;m really getting into the Internet lately .
I just wish it were more organized . &quot;
So ...
If I controlled the Internet , you could auction your broken heart on eBay .
Take the money ; go to Amazon ; buy a phonebook for a country you &apos;ve never been to -- call folks at random until you find someone who flirts really well in a foreign language .
If I were in charge of the Internet , you could Mapquest your lover &apos;s mood swings .
Hang left at cranky , right at preoccupied , U-turn on silent treatment , all the way back to tongue kissing and good lovin &apos; .
You could navigate and understand every emotional intersection .
Some days , I &apos;m as shallow as a baking pan , but I still stretch miles in all directions .
If I owned the Internet , Napster , Monster and Friendster.com would be one big website .
That way you could listen to cool music while you pretend to look for a job and you &apos;re really just chattin &apos; with your pals .
Heck , if I ran the Web , you could email dead people .
They would not email you back -- but you &apos;d get an automated reply .
Their name in your inbox -- it &apos;s all you wanted anyway .
And a message saying , &quot; Hey , it &apos;s me . I miss you .
Listen , you &apos;ll see being dead is dandy .
Now you go back to raising kids and waging peace and craving candy . &quot;
If I designed the Internet , childhood.com would be a loop of a boy in an orchard , with a ski pole for a sword , trashcan lid for a shield , shouting , &quot; I am the emperor of oranges .
I am the emperor of oranges . I am the emperor of oranges . &quot;
Now follow me , OK ?
Grandma.com would be a recipe for biscuits and spit-bath instructions .
One , two , three .
That links with hotdiggitydog.com.
That is my grandfather .
They take you to gruff-ex-cop-on-his-fourth-marriage.dad.
He forms an attachment to kind-of-ditzy-but-still-sends-ginger-snaps-for-Christmas.mom , who downloads the boy in the orchard , the emperor of oranges , who grows up to be me -- the guy who usually goes too far .
So if I were emperor of the Internet , I guess I &apos;d still be mortal , huh ?
But at that point , I would probably already have the lowest possible mortgage and the most enlarged possible penis -- so I would outlaw spam on my first day in office .
I wouldn &apos;t need it .
I &apos;d be like some kind of Internet genius , and me , I &apos;d like to upgrade to deity and maybe just like that -- pop ! -- I &apos;d go wireless .
Huh ? Maybe Google would hire this .
I could zip through your servers and firewalls like a virus until the World Wide Web is as wise , as wild and as organized as I think a modern-day miracle / oracle can get , but , ooh-eee , you want to bet just how whack and un-PC your Mac or PC is going to be when I &apos;m rocking hot-shit-hot-shot-god.net ?
I guess it &apos;s just like life .
It is not a question of if you can -- it &apos;s : do ya ?
We can interfere with the interface .
We can make &quot; You &apos;ve got Hallelujah &quot; the national anthem of cyberspace every lucky time we log on .
You don &apos;t say a prayer .
You don &apos;t write a psalm .
You don &apos;t chant an &quot; om . &quot;
You send one blessed email to whomever you &apos;re thinking of at dah-da-la-dat-da-dah-da-la-dat.com.
Thank you , TED .
Bill Davenhall : Your health depends on where you live
Where you live : It impacts your health as much as diet and genes do , but it &apos;s not part of your medical records . At TEDMED , Bill Davenhall shows how overlooked government geo-data can mesh with mobile GPS apps to keep doctors in the loop . Call it &quot; geo-medicine . &quot;
Can geographic information make you healthy ?
In 2001 I got hit by a train .
My train was a heart attack .
I found myself in a hospital in an intensive-care ward , recuperating from emergency surgery .
And I suddenly realized something : that I was completely in the dark .
I started asking my questions , &quot; Well , why me ? &quot;
&quot; Why now ? &quot; &quot; Why here ? &quot;
&quot; Could my doctor have warned me ? &quot;
So , what I want to do here in the few minutes I have with you is really talk about what is the formula for life and good health .
Genetics , lifestyle and environment .
That &apos;s going to sort of contain our risks , and if we manage those risks we &apos;re going to live a good life and a good healthy life .
Well , I understand the genetics and lifestyle part .
And you know why I understand that ?
Because my physicians constantly ask me questions about this .
Have you ever had to fill out those long , legal-size forms in your doctor &apos;s office ?
I mean , if you &apos;re lucky enough you get to do it more than once , right ?
Do it over and over again . And they ask you questions about your lifestyle and your family history , your medication history , your surgical history , your allergy history ... did I forget any history ?
But this part of the equation I didn &apos;t really get , and I don &apos;t think my physicians really get this part of the equation .
What does that mean , my environment ?
Well , it can mean a lot of things .
This is my life . These are my life places .
We all have these .
While I &apos;m talking I &apos;d like you to also be thinking about : How many places have you lived ?
Just think about that , you know , wander through your life thinking about this .
And you realize that you spend it in a variety of different places .
You spend it at rest and you spend it at work .
And if you &apos;re like me , you &apos;re in an airplane a good portion of your time traveling some place .
So , it &apos;s not really simple when somebody asks you , &quot; Where do you live , where do you work , and where do you spend all your time ?
And where do you expose yourselves to risks that maybe perhaps you don &apos;t even see ? &quot;
Well , when I have done this on myself , I always come to the conclusion that I spend about 75 percent of my time relatively in a small number of places .
And I don &apos;t wander far from that place for a majority of my time , even though I &apos;m an extensive global trekker .
Now , I &apos;m going to take you on a little journey here .
I started off in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
I don &apos;t know if anybody might hail from northeastern Pennsylvania , but this is where I spent my first 19 years with my little young lungs .
You know , breathing high concentrations here of sulfur dioxide , carbon dioxide and methane gas , in unequal quantities -- 19 years of this .
And if you &apos;ve been in that part of the country , this is what those piles of burning , smoldering coal waste look like .
So then I decided to leave that part of the world , and I was going to go to the mid-west .
OK , so I ended up in Louisville , Kentucky .
Well , I decided to be neighbors to a place called Rubbertown .
They manufacture plastics . They use large quantities chloroprene and benzene .
Okay , I spent 25 years , in my middle-age lungs now , breathing various concentrations of that .
And on a clear day it always looked like this , so you never saw it .
It was insidious and it was really happening .
Then I decided I had to get really smart , I would take this job in the West Coast .
And I moved to Redlands California .
Very nice , and there my older , senior lungs , as I like to call them , I filled with particulate matter , carbon dioxide and very high doses of ozone .
Okay ? Almost like the highest in the nation .
Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
If you &apos;ve been there , you know what I &apos;m talking about .
So , what &apos;s wrong with this picture ?
Well , the picture is , there is a huge gap here .
The one thing that never happens in my doctor &apos;s office : They never ask me about my place history .
No doctor , can I remember , ever asking me , &quot; Where have you lived ? &quot;
They haven &apos;t asked me what kind of the quality of the drinking water that I put in my mouth or the food that I ingest into my stomach .
They really don &apos;t do that . It &apos;s missing .
Look at the kind of data that &apos;s available .
This data &apos;s from all over the world -- countries spend billions of dollars investing in this kind of research .
Now , I &apos;ve circled the places where I &apos;ve been .
Well , by design , if I wanted to have a heart attack I &apos;d been in the right places . Right ?
So , how many people are in the white ?
How many people in the room have spent the majority of their life in the white space ?
Anybody ? Boy you &apos;re lucky .
How many have spent it in the red places ?
Oh , not so lucky .
There are thousands of these kinds of maps that are displayed in atlases all over the world .
They give us some sense of what &apos;s going to be our train wreck .
But none of that &apos;s in my medical record .
And it &apos;s not in yours either .
So , here &apos;s my friend Paul .
He &apos;s a colleague . He allowed his cell phone to be tracked every two hours , 24 / 7 , 365 days out of the year for the last two years , everywhere he went .
And you can see he &apos;s been to a few places around the United States .
And this is where he has spent most of his time .
If you really studied that you might have some clues as to what Paul likes to do .
Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
We can zoom in here , and we suddenly see that now we see where Paul has really spent a majority of his time .
And all of those black dots are all of the toxic release inventories that are monitored by the EPA .
Did you know that data existed ?
For every community in the United States , you could have your own personalized map of that .
So , our cell phones can now build a place history .
This is how Paul did it . He did it with his iPhone .
This might be what we end up with .
This is what the physician would have in front of him and her when we enter that exam room instead of just the pink slip that said I paid at the counter . Right ?
This could be my little assessment .
And he looks at that and he says , &quot; Whoa Bill , I suggest that maybe you not decide , just because you &apos;re out here in beautiful California , and it &apos;s warm every day , that you get out and run at six o &apos;clock at night .
I &apos;d suggest that that &apos;s a bad idea Bill , because of this report . &quot;
What I &apos;d like to leave you for are two prescriptions .
Okay , number one is , we must teach physicians about the value of geographical information .
It &apos;s called geomedicine . There are about a half a dozen programs in the world right now that are focused on this .
And they &apos;re in the early stages of development .
These programs need to be supported , and we need to teach our future doctors of the world the importance of some of the information I &apos;ve shared here with you today .
The second thing we need to do is while we &apos;re spending billions and billions of dollars all over the world building an electronic health record , we make sure we put a place history inside that medical record .
It not only will be important for the physician ; it will be important for the researchers that now will have huge samples to draw upon .
But it will also be useful for us .
I could have made the decision , if I had this information , not to move to the ozone capital of the United States , couldn &apos;t I ? I could make that decision .
Or I could negotiate with my employer to make that decision in the best interest of myself and my company .
With that , I would like to just say that Jack Lord said this almost 10 years ago .
Just look at that for a minute .
That was what the conclusion of the Dartmouth Atlas of Healthcare was about , was saying that we can explain the geographic variations that occur in disease , in illness , in wellness , and how our healthcare system actually operates .
That was what he was talking about on that quote .
And I would say he got it right almost a decade ago .
So , I &apos;d very much like to see us begin to really seize this as an opportunity to get this into our medical records .
So with that , I &apos;ll leave you that in my particular view of view of health : Geography always matters .
And I believe that geographic information can make both you and me very healthy . Thank you .
Gary Wolf : The quantified self
At TED @ Cannes , Gary Wolf gives a 5-min intro to an intriguing new pastime : using mobile apps and always-on gadgets to track and analyze your body , mood , diet , spending -- just about everything in daily life you can measure -- in gloriously geeky detail .
I got up this morning at 6 : 10 a.m.
after going to sleep at 12 : 45 a.m.
I was awakened once during the night .
My heart rate was 61 beats per minute -- my blood pressure , 127 over 74 .
I had zero minutes of exercise yesterday , so my maximum heart rate during exercise wasn &apos;t calculated .
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine , zero of alcohol .
And my score on the Narcissism Personality Index , or the NPI-16 , is a reassuring 0.31 .
We know that numbers are useful for us when we advertise , manage , govern , search .
I &apos;m going to talk about how they &apos;re useful when we reflect , learn , remember and want to improve .
A few years ago , Kevin Kelly , my partner , and I noticed that people were subjecting themselves to regimes of quantitative measurement and self-tracking that went far beyond the ordinary , familiar habits such as stepping on a scale every day .
People were tracking their food via Twitter , their kids &apos; diapers on their iPhone .
They were making detailed journals of their spending , their mood , their symptoms , their treatments .
Now , we know some of the technological facts that are driving this change in our lifestyle -- the uptake and diffusion of mobile devices , the exponential improvement in data storage and data processing , and the remarkable improvement in human biometric sensors .
This little black dot there is a 3D accelerometer .
It tracks your movement through space .
It is , as you can see , very small and also very cheap .
They &apos;re now down to well under a dollar a piece , and they &apos;re going into all kinds of devices .
But what &apos;s interesting is the incredible detailed information that you can get from just one sensor like this .
This kind of sensor is in the hit biometric device -- among early adopters at the moment -- the Fitbit .
This tracks your activity and also your sleep .
It has just that sensor in it .
You &apos;re probably familiar with the Nike + system .
I just put it up because that little blue dot is the sensor .
It &apos;s really just a pressure sensor like the kind that &apos;s in a doorbell .
And Nike knows how to get your pace and distance from just that sensor .
This is the strap that people use to transmit heart-rate data to their Nike + system .
This is a beautiful , new device that gives you detailed sleep tracking data , not just whether you &apos;re asleep or awake , but also your phase of sleep -- deep sleep , light sleep , REM sleep .
The sensor is just a little strip of metal in that headband there .
The rest of it is the bedside console ; just for reference , this is a sleep tracking system from just a few years ago -- I mean , really until now .
And this is the sleep tracking system of today .
This just was presented at a health care conference in D.C.
Most of what you see there is an asthma inhaler , but the top is a very small GPS transceiver , which gives you the date and location of an asthma incident , giving you a new awareness of your vulnerability in relation to time and environmental factors .
Now , we know that new tools are changing our sense of self in the world -- these tiny sensors that gather data in nature , the ubiquitous computing that allows that data to be understood and used , and of course the social networks that allow people to collaborate and contribute .
But we think of these tools as pointing outward , as windows and I &apos;d just like to invite you to think of them as also turning inward and becoming mirrors .
So that when we think about using them to get some systematic improvement , we also think about how they can be useful for self-improvement , for self-discovery , self-awareness , self-knowledge .
Here &apos;s a biometric device : a pair of Apple Earbuds .
Last year , Apple filed some patents to get blood oxygenation , heart rate and body temperature via the Earbuds .
What is this for ?
What should it be for ?
Some people will say it &apos;s for biometric security .
Some people will say it &apos;s for public health research .
Some people will say it &apos;s for avant-garde marketing research .
I &apos;d like to tell you that it &apos;s also for self-knowledge .
And the self isn &apos;t the only thing ; it &apos;s not even most things .
The self is just our operation center , our consciousness , our moral compass .
So , if we want to act more effectively in the world , we have to get to know ourselves better .
Thank you .
JR : My wish : Use art to turn the world inside out
JR , a semi-anonymous French street artist , uses his camera to show the world its true face , by pasting photos of the human face across massive canvases . At TED2011 , he makes his audacious TED Prize wish : to use art to turn the world inside out . Learn more about his work and learn how you can join in at insideoutproject.net.
Two weeks ago I was in my studio in Paris , and the phone rang and I heard , &quot; Hey , JR , you won the TED Prize 2011 .
You have to make a wish to save the world . &quot;
I was lost .
I mean , I can &apos;t save the world . Nobody can .
The world is fucked up .
Come on , you have dictators ruling the world , population is growing by millions , there &apos;s no more fish in the sea , the North Pole is melting and as the last TED Prize winner said , we &apos;re all becoming fat .
Except maybe French people .
Whatever .
So I called back and I told her , &quot; Look , Amy , tell the TED guys I just won &apos;t show up .
I can &apos;t do anything to save the world . &quot;
She said , &quot; Hey , JR , your wish is not to save the world , but to change the world . &quot;
&quot; Oh , all right . &quot;
&quot; That &apos;s cool . &quot;
I mean , technology , politics , business do change the world -- not always in a good way , but they do .
What about art ?
Could art change the world ?
I started when I was 15 years old .
And at that time , I was not thinking about changing the world .
I was doing graffiti -- writing my name everywhere , using the city as a canvas .
I was going in the tunnels of Paris , on the rooftops with my friends .
Each trip was an excursion , was an adventure .
It was like leaving our mark on society , to say , &quot; I was here , &quot; on the top of a building .
So when I found a cheap camera on the subway , I started documenting those adventures with my friends and gave them back as photocopies -- really small photos just that size .
That &apos;s how , at 17 years old , I started pasting them .
And I did my first &quot; expo de rue , &quot; which means sidewalk gallery .
And I framed it with color so you would not confuse it with advertising .
I mean , the city &apos;s the best gallery I could imagine .
I would never have to make a book and then present it to a gallery and let them decide if my work was nice enough to show it to people .
I would control it directly with the public in the streets .
So that &apos;s Paris .
I would change -- depending on the places I would go -- the title of the exhibition .
That &apos;s on the Champs-Elysees .
I was quite proud of that one .
Because I was just 18 and I was just up there on the top of the Champs-Elysees .
Then when the photo left , the frame was still there .
November 2005 : the streets are burning .
A large wave of riots had broken into the first projects of Paris .
Everyone was glued to the TV , watching disturbing , frightening images taken from the edge of the neighborhood .
I mean , these kids , without control , throwing Molotov cocktails , attacking the cops and the firemen , looting everything they could in the shops .
These were criminals , thugs , dangerous , destroying their own environment .
And then I saw it -- could it be possible ? -- my photo on a wall revealed by a burning car -- a pasting I &apos;d done a year earlier -- an illegal one -- still there .
I mean , these were the faces of my friends .
I know those guys .
All of them are not angels , but they &apos;re not monsters either .
So it was kind of weird to see those images and those eyes stare back at me through a television .
So I went back there with a 28 mm lens .
It was the only one I had at that time .
But with that lens , you have to be as close as 10 inches from the person .
So you can do it only with their trust .
So I took full portraits of people from Le Bosquet .
They were making scary faces to play the caricature of themselves .
And then I pasted huge posters everywhere in the bourgeois area of Paris with the name , age , even building number of these guys .
A year later , the exhibition was displayed in front of the city hall of Paris .
And we go from thug images , who &apos;ve been stolen and distorted by the media , who &apos;s now proudly taking over his own image .
That &apos;s where I realized the power of paper and glue .
So could art change the world ?
A year later , I was listening to all the noise about the Middle East conflict .
I mean , at that time , trust me , they were only referring to the Israeli and Palestinian conflict .
So with my friend Marco , we decided to go there and see who are the real Palestinians and who are the real Israelis .
Are they so different ?
When we got there , we just went in the street , started talking with people everywhere , and we realized that things were a bit different from the rhetoric we heard in the media .
So we decided to take portraits of Palestinians and Israelis doing the same jobs -- taxi-driver , lawyer , cooks .
Asked them to make a face as a sign of commitment .
Not a smile -- that really doesn &apos;t tell about who you are and what you feel .
They all accepted to be pasted next to the other .
I decided to paste in eight Israeli and Palestinian cities and on both sides of the wall .
We launched the biggest illegal art exhibition ever .
We called the project Face 2 Face .
The experts said , &quot; No way .
The people will not accept .
The army will shoot you , and Hamas will kidnap you . &quot;
We said , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s try and push as far as we can . &quot;
I love the way that people will ask me , &quot; How big will my photo be ? &quot;
&quot; It will be as big as your house . &quot;
When we did the wall , we did the Palestinian side .
So we arrived with just our ladders and we realized that they were not high enough .
And so Palestinians guys say , &quot; Calm down . No wait . I &apos;m going to find you a solution . &quot;
So he went to the Church of Nativity and brought back an old ladder that was so old that it could have seen Jesus being born .
We did Face 2 Face with only six friends , two ladders , two brushes , a rented car , a camera and 20,000 square feet of paper .
We had all sorts of help from all walks of life .
Okay , for example , that &apos;s Palestine .
We &apos;re in Ramallah right now .
We &apos;re pasting portraits -- so both portraits in the streets in a crowded market .
People come around us and start asking , &quot; What are you doing here ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , we &apos;re actually doing an art project and we are pasting an Israeli and a Palestinian doing the same job .
And those ones are actually two taxi-drivers . &quot;
And then there was always a silence .
&quot; You mean you &apos;re pasting an Israeli face -- doing a face -- right here ? &quot;
&quot; Well , yeah , yeah , that &apos;s part of the project . &quot;
And I would always leave that moment , and we would ask them , &quot; So can you tell me who is who ? &quot;
And most of them couldn &apos;t say .
We even pasted on Israeli military towers , and nothing happened .
When you paste an image , it &apos;s just paper and glue .
People can tear it , tag on it , or even pee on it -- some are a bit high for that , I agree -- but the people in the street , they are the curator .
The rain and the wind will take them off anyway .
They are not meant to stay .
But exactly four years after , the photos , most of them are still there .
Face 2 Face demonstrated that what we thought impossible was possible -- and , you know what , even easy .
We didn &apos;t push the limit ; we just showed that they were further than anyone thought .
In the Middle East , I experienced my work in places without &#91; many &#93; museums .
So the reactions in the street were kind of interesting .
So I decided to go further in this direction and go in places where there were zero museums .
When you go in these developing societies , women are the pillars of their community , but the men are still the ones holding the streets .
So we were inspired to create a project where men will pay tribute to women by posting their photos .
I called that project Women Are Heroes .
When I listened to all the stories everywhere I went on the continents , I couldn &apos;t always understand the complicated circumstances of their conflict .
I just observed .
Sometimes there was no words , no sentence , just tears .
I just took their pictures and pasted them .
Women Are Heroes took me around the world .
Most of the places I went to , I decided to go there because I &apos;ve heard about it through the media .
So for example , in June 2008 , I was watching TV in Paris , and then I heard about this terrible thing that happened in Rio de Janeiro -- the first favela of Brazil named Providencia .
Three kids -- that was three students -- were &#91; detained &#93; by the army because they were not carrying their papers .
And the army took them , and instead of bringing them to the police station , they brought them to an enemy favela where they get chopped into pieces .
I was shocked .
All Brazil was shocked .
I heard it was one of the most violent favelas , because the largest drug cartel controls it .
So I decided to go there .
When I arrived -- I mean , I didn &apos;t have any contact with any NGO .
There was none in place -- no association , no NGOs , nothing -- no eyewitnesses .
So we just walked around , and we met a woman , and I showed her my book .
And she said , &quot; You know what ?
We &apos;re hungry for culture .
We need culture out there . &quot;
So I went out and I started with the kids .
I just took a few photos of the kids , and the next day I came with the posters and we pasted them .
The day after , I came back and they were already scratched .
But that &apos;s okay .
I wanted them to feel that this art belongs to them .
Then the next day , I held a meeting on the main square and some women came .
They were all linked to the three kids that got killed .
There was the mother , the grandmother , the best friend -- they all wanted to shout the story .
After that day , everyone in the favela gave me the green light .
I took more photos , and we started the project .
The drug lords were kind of worried about us filming in the place , so I told them , &quot; You know what ?
I &apos;m not interested in filming the violence and the weapons .
You see that enough in the media .
What I want to show is the incredible life and energy .
I &apos;ve been seeing it around me the last few days . &quot;
So that &apos;s a really symbolic pasting , because that &apos;s the first one we did that you couldn &apos;t see from the city .
And that &apos;s where the three kids got arrested , and that &apos;s the grandmother of one of them .
And on that stairs , that &apos;s where the traffickers always stand and there &apos;s a lot of exchange of fire .
Everyone there understood the project .
And then we pasted everywhere -- the whole hill .
What was interesting is that the media couldn &apos;t get in .
I mean , you should see that .
They would have to film us from a really long distance by helicopter and then have a really long lens , and we would see ourselves , on TV , pasting .
And they would put a number : &quot; Please call this number if you know what &apos;s going on in Providencia . &quot;
We just did a project and then left so the media wouldn &apos;t know .
So how can we know about the project ?
So they had to go and find the women and get an explanation from them .
So you create a bridge between the media and the anonymous women .
We kept traveling .
We went to Africa , Sudan , Sierra Leone , Liberia , Kenya .
In war-torn places like Monrovia , people come straight to you .
I mean , they want to know what you &apos;re up to .
They kept asking me , &quot; What is the purpose of your project ?
Are you an NGO ? Are you the media ? &quot;
Art . Just doing art .
Some people question , &quot; Why is it in black and white ?
Don &apos;t you have color in France ? &quot;
Or they tell you , &quot; Are these people all dead ? &quot;
Some who understood the project would explain it to others .
And to a man who did not understand , I heard someone say , &quot; You know , you &apos;ve been here for a few hours trying to understand , discussing with your fellows .
During that time , you haven &apos;t thought about what you &apos;re going to eat tomorrow .
This is art . &quot;
I think it &apos;s people &apos;s curiosity that motivates them to come into the projects .
And then it becomes more .
It becomes a desire , a need , an armor .
On this bridge that &apos;s in Monrovia , ex-rebel soldiers helped us pasting a portrait of a woman that might have been raped during the war .
Women are always the first ones targeted during conflict .
This is Kibera , Kenya , one of the largest slums of Africa .
You might have seen images about the post-election violence that happened there in 2008 .
This time we covered the roofs of the houses , but we didn &apos;t use paper , because paper doesn &apos;t prevent the rain from leaking inside the house -- vinyl does .
Then art becomes useful .
So the people kept it .
You know what I love is , for example , when you see the biggest eye there , there are so &#91; many &#93; houses inside .
And I went there a few months ago -- photos are still there -- and it was missing a piece of the eye .
So I asked the people what happened .
&quot; Oh , that guy just moved . &quot;
When the roofs were covered , a woman said as a joke , &quot; Now God can see me . &quot;
When you look at Kibera now , they look back .
Okay , India .
Before I start that , just so you know , each time we go to a place , we don &apos;t have authorization , so we set up like commandos -- we &apos;re a group of friends who arrive there , and we try to paste on the walls .
But there are places where you just can &apos;t paste on a wall .
In India it was just impossible to paste .
I heard culturally and because of the law , they would just arrest us at the first pasting .
So we decided to paste white , white on the walls .
So imagine white guys pasting white papers .
So people would come to us and ask us , &quot; Hey , what are you up to ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , you know , we &apos;re just doing art . &quot; &quot; Art ? &quot;
Of course , they were confused .
But you know how India has a lot of dust in the streets , and the more dust you would have going up in the air , on the white paper you can almost see , but there is this sticky part like when you reverse a sticker .
So the more dust you have , the more it will reveal the photo .
So we could just walk in the street during the next days and the photos would get revealed by themselves .
Thank you .
So we didn &apos;t get caught this time .
Each project -- that &apos;s a film from Women Are Heroes .
Okay .
For each project we do a film .
And most of what you see -- that &apos;s a trailer from &quot; Women Are Heroes &quot; -- its images , photography , taken one after the other .
And the photos kept traveling even without us .
Hopefully , you &apos;ll see the film , and you &apos;ll understand the scope of the project and what the people felt when they saw those photos .
Because that &apos;s a big part of it . There &apos;s layers behind each photo .
Behind each image is a story .
Women Are Heroes created a new dynamic in each of the communities , and the women kept that dynamic after we left .
For example , we did books -- not for sale -- that all the community would get .
But to get it , they would have to &#91; get &#93; it signed by one of the women .
We did that in most of the places .
We go back regularly .
And so in Providencia , for example , in the favela , we have a cultural center running there .
In Kibera , each year we cover more roofs .
Because of course , when we left , the people who were just at the edge of the project said , &quot; Hey , what about my roof ? &quot;
So we decided to come the year after and keep doing the project .
A really important point for me is that I don &apos;t use any brand or corporate sponsors .
So I have no responsibility to anyone but myself and the subjects .
And that is for me one of the more important things in the work .
I think , today , as important as the result is the way you do things .
And that has always been a central part of the work .
And what &apos;s interesting is that fine line that I have with images and advertising .
We just did some pasting in Los Angeles on another project in the last weeks .
And I was even invited to cover the MOCA museum .
But yesterday the city called them and said , &quot; Look , you &apos;re going to have to tear it down .
Because this can be taken for advertising , and because of the law , it has to be taken down . &quot;
But tell me , advertising for what ?
The people I photograph were proud to participate in the project and to have their photo in the community .
But they asked me for a promise basically .
They asked me , &quot; Please , make our story travel with you . &quot;
So I did . That &apos;s Paris .
That &apos;s Rio .
In each place , we built exhibitions with a story , and the story traveled .
You understand the full scope of the project .
That &apos;s London .
New York .
And today , they are with you in Long Beach .
All right , recently I started a public art project where I don &apos;t use my artwork anymore .
I use Man Ray , Helen Levitt , Giacomelli , other people &apos;s artwork .
It doesn &apos;t matter today if it &apos;s your photo or not .
The importance is what you do with the images , the statement it makes where it &apos;s pasted .
So for example , I pasted the photo of the minaret in Switzerland a few weeks after they voted the law forbidding minarets in the country .
This image of three men wearing gas masks was taken in Chernobyl originally , and I pasted it in Southern Italy , where the mafia sometimes bury the garbage under the ground .
In some ways , art can change the world .
Art is not supposed to change the world , to change practical things , but to change perceptions .
Art can change the way we see the world .
Art can create an analogy .
Actually the fact that art cannot change things makes it a neutral place for exchanges and discussions , and then enables you to change the world .
When I do my work , I have two kinds of reactions .
People say , &quot; Oh , why don &apos;t you go in Iraq or Afghanistan .
They would be really useful . &quot;
Or , &quot; How can we help ? &quot;
I presume that you belong to the second category , and that &apos;s good , because for that project , I &apos;m going to ask you to take the photos and paste them .
So now my wish is : I wish for you to stand up for what you care about by participating in a global art project , and together we &apos;ll turn the world inside out .
And this starts right now .
Yes , everyone in the room .
Everyone watching .
I wanted that wish to actually start now .
So a subject you &apos;re passionate about , a person who you want to tell their story or even your own photos -- tell me what you stand for .
Take the photos , the portraits , upload it -- I &apos;ll give you all the details -- and I &apos;ll send you back your poster . Join by groups and reveal things to the world .
The full data is on the website -- insideoutproject.net -- that is launching today .
What we see changes who we are .
When we act together , the whole thing is much more than the sum of the parts .
So I hope that , together , we &apos;ll create something that the world will remember .
And this starts right now and depends on you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Suzanne Lee : Grow your own clothes
Designer Suzanne Lee shares her experiments in growing a kombucha-based material that can be used like fabric or vegetable leather to make clothing . The process is fascinating , the results are beautiful and the potential is simply stunning .
So as a fashion designer , I &apos;ve always tended to think of materials something like this , or this , or maybe this .
But then I met a biologist , and now I think of materials like this -- green tea , sugar , a few microbes and a little time .
I &apos;m essentially using a kombucha recipe , which is a symbiotic mix of bacteria , yeasts and other micro-organisms , which spin cellulose in a fermentation process .
Over time , these tiny threads form in the liquid into layers and produce a mat on the surface .
So we start by brewing the tea .
I brew up to about 30 liters of tea at a time , and then while it &apos;s still hot , add a couple of kilos of sugar .
We stir this in until it &apos;s completely dissolved and then pour it into a growth bath .
We need to check that the temperature has cooled to below 30 degrees C.
And then we &apos;re ready to add the living organism .
And along with that , some acetic acid .
And once you get this process going , you can actually recycle your previous fermented liquid .
We need to maintain an optimum temperature for the growth .
And I use a heat mat to sit the bath on and a thermostat to regulate it .
And actually , in hot weather , I can just grow it outside .
So this is my mini fabric farm .
After about three days , the bubbles will appear on the surface of the liquid .
So this is telling us that the fermentation is in full swing .
And the bacteria are feeding on the sugar nutrients in the liquid .
So they &apos;re spinning these tiny nano fibers of pure cellulose .
And they &apos;re sticking together , forming layers and giving us a sheet on the surface .
After about two to three weeks , we &apos;re looking at something which is about an inch in thickness .
So the bath on the left is after five days , and on the right , after 10 .
And this is a static culture .
You don &apos;t have to do anything to it ; you just literally watch it grow .
It doesn &apos;t need light .
And when it &apos;s ready to harvest , you take it out of the bath and you wash it in cold , soapy water .
At this point , it &apos;s really heavy .
It &apos;s over 90 percent water , so we need to let that evaporate .
So I spread it out onto a wooden sheet .
Again , you can do that outside and just let it dry in the air .
And as it &apos;s drying , it &apos;s compressing , so what you &apos;re left with , depending on the recipe , is something that &apos;s either like a really light-weight , transparent paper , or something which is much more like a flexible vegetable leather .
And then you can either cut that out and sew it conventionally , or you can use the wet material to form it around a three-dimensional shape .
And as it evaporates , it will knit itself together , forming seams .
So the color in this jacket is coming purely from green tea .
I guess it also looks a little bit like human skin , which intrigues me .
Since it &apos;s organic , I &apos;m really keen to try and minimize the addition of any chemicals .
I can make it change color without using dye by a process of iron oxidation .
Using fruit and vegetable staining , create organic patterning .
And using indigo , make it anti-microbial .
And in fact , cotton would take up to 18 dips in indigo to achieve a color this dark .
And because of the super-absorbency of this kind of cellulose , it just takes one , and a really short one at that .
What I can &apos;t yet do is make it water-resistant .
So if I was to walk outside in the rain wearing this dress today , I would immediately start to absorb huge amounts of water .
The dress would get really heavy , and eventually the seams would probably fall apart -- leaving me feeling rather naked .
Possibly a good performance piece , but definitely not ideal for everyday wear .
What I &apos;m looking for is a way to give the material the qualities that I need .
So what I want to do is say to a future bug , &quot; Spin me a thread .
Align it in this direction .
Make it hydrophobic .
And while you &apos;re at it , just form it around this 3D shape . &quot;
Bacterial cellulose is actually already being used for wound healing , and possibly in the future for biocompatible blood vessels , possibly even replacement bone tissue .
But with synthetic biology , we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality , quantity and shape of material that we desire .
Obviously , as a designer , that &apos;s really exciting because then I start to think , wow , we could actually imagine growing consumable products .
What excites me about using microbes is their efficiency .
So we only grow what we need .
There &apos;s no waste .
And in fact , we could make it from a waste stream -- so for example , a waste sugar stream from a food processing plant .
Finally , at the end of use , we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings .
What I &apos;m not suggesting is that microbial cellulose is going to be a replacement for cotton , leather or other textile materials .
But I do think it could be quite a smart and sustainable addition to our increasingly precious natural resources .
Ultimately , maybe it won &apos;t even be fashion where we see these microbes have their impact .
We could , for example , imagine growing a lamp , a chair , a car or maybe even a house .
So I guess what my question to you is : in the future , what would you choose to grow ?
Thank you very much .
Suzanne , just a curiosity , what you &apos;re wearing is not random .
This is one of the jackets you grew ?
SL : Yes , it is .
It &apos;s probably -- part of the project &apos;s still in process because this one is actually biodegrading in front of your eyes .
It &apos;s absorbing my sweat , and it &apos;s feeding on it .
Okay , so we &apos;ll let you go and save it , and rescue it .

Jon Nguyen : Tour the solar system from home
Want to navigate the solar system without having to buy that expensive spacecraft ? Jon Nguyen demos NASAJPL &apos;s &quot; Eyes on the Solar System &quot; -- free-to-use software for exploring the planets , moons , asteroids , and spacecraft that rotate around our sun in real-time .
As a kid , I was fascinated with all things air and space .
I would watch Nova on PBS .
Our school would show Bill Nye the Science Guy .
When I was in elementary school , my next door neighbor , he gave me a book for my birthday .
It was an astronomy book , and I poured over that thing for hours on end , and it was a combination of all these things that inspired me to pursue space exploration as my own personal dream , and part of that dream was , I always wanted to just fly around the solar system and visit different planets and visit moons and spacecraft .
Well , a number of years later , I graduated from UCLA and I found myself at NASA , working for the jet propulsion laboratory , and there our team was challenged to create a 3D visualization of the solar system , and today I want to show you what we &apos;ve done so far .
Now , the kicker is , everything I &apos;m about to do here you can do at home , because we built this for the public for you guys to use .
So what you &apos;re looking at right now is the Earth .
You can see the United States and California and San Diego , and you can use the mouse or the keyboard to spin things around .
Now , this isn &apos;t new . Anyone who &apos;s used Google Earth has seen this before , but one thing we like to say in our group is , we do the opposite of Google Earth .
Google Earth goes from this view down to your backyard .
We go from this view out to the stars .
So the Earth is cool , but what we really want to show are the spacecraft , so I &apos;m going to bring the interface back up , and now you &apos;re looking at a number of satellites orbiting the Earth .
These are a number of our science space Earth orbiters .
We haven &apos;t included military satellites and weather satellites and communication satellites and reconnaissance satellites .
If we did , it would be a complete mess , because there &apos;s a lot of stuff out there .
And the cool thing is , we actually created 3D models for a number of these spacecraft , so if you want to visit any of these , all you need to do is double-click on them .
So I &apos;m going to find the International Space Station , double-click , and it will take us all the way down to the ISS .
And now you &apos;re riding along with the ISS where it is right now .
And the other cool thing is , not only can we move the camera around , we can also control time , so I can slide this jog dial here to shuttle time forward , and now we can see what a sunset on the ISS would look like , and they get one every 90 minutes .
All right , so what about the rest of it ?
Well , I can click on this home button over here , and that will take us up to the inner solar system , and now we &apos;re looking at the rest of the solar system .
You can see , there &apos;s Saturn , there &apos;s Jupiter , and while we &apos;re here , I want to point out something .
It &apos;s actually pretty busy .
Here we have the Mars Science Laboratory on its way to Mars , just launched last weekend .
Here we have Juno on its cruise to Jupiter , there .
We have Dawn orbiting Vesta , and we have over here New Horizons on a straight shot to Pluto .
And I mention this because there &apos;s this strange public perception that NASA &apos;s dead , that the space shuttles stopped flying and all of the sudden there &apos;s no more spacecraft out there .
Well , a lot of what NASA does is robotic exploration , and we have a lot of spacecraft out there .
Granted , we &apos;re not sending humans up at the moment , well at least with our own launch vehicles , but NASA is far from dead , and one of the reasons why we write a program like this is so that people realize that there &apos;s so many other things that we &apos;re doing .
Anyway , while we &apos;re here , again , if you want to visit anything , all you need to do is double-click .
So I &apos;m just going to double-click on Vesta , and here we have Dawn orbiting Vesta , and this is happening right now .
I &apos;m going to double-click on Uranus , and we can see Uranus rotating on its side along with its moons .
You can see how it &apos;s tilted at about 89 degrees .
And just being able to visit different places and go through different times , we have data from 1950 to 2050 .
Granted , we don &apos;t have everything in between , because some of the data is hard to get .
Just being able to visit places in different times , you can explore this for hours , literally hours on end , but I want to show you one thing in particular , so I &apos;m going to open up the destination tab , spacecraft outer planet missions , Voyager 1 , and I &apos;m going to bring up the Titan flyby .
So now we &apos;ve gone back in time .
We &apos;re now riding along with Voyager 1 .
The date here is November 11 , 1980 .
Now , there &apos;s a funny thing going on here .
It doesn &apos;t look like anything &apos;s going on .
It looks like I &apos;ve paused the program .
It &apos;s actually running at real rate right now , one second per second , and in fact , Voyager 1 here is flying by Titan at I think it &apos;s 38,000 miles per hour .
It only looks like nothing &apos;s moving because , well , Saturn here is 700,000 miles away , and Titan here is 4,000 to 5,000 miles away .
It &apos;s just the vastness of space makes it look like nothing &apos;s happening .
But to make it more interesting , I &apos;m going to speed up time , and we can watch as Voyager 1 flies by Titan , which is a hazy moon of Saturn .
It actually has a very thick atmosphere .
And I &apos;m going to recenter the camera on Saturn , here .
I &apos;m going to pull out , and I want to show you Voyager 1 as it flies by Saturn .
There &apos;s a point to be made here .
With a 3D visualization like this , we can not only just say Voyager 1 flew by Saturn .
There &apos;s a whole story to tell here .
And even better , because it &apos;s an interactive application , you can tell the story for yourself .
If you want to pause it , you can pause it .
If you want to keep going , if you want to change the camera angle , you can do that , and because of that , I can show you that Voyager 1 doesn &apos;t just fly by Saturn .
It actually flies underneath Saturn .
Now , what happens is , as it flies underneath Saturn , Saturn grabs it gravitationally and flings it up and out of the solar system , so if I just keep letting this go , you can see Voyager 1 fly up like that .
And , in fact , I &apos;m going to go back to the solar system .
I &apos;m going to go back to today , now , and I want to show you where Voyager 1 is .
Right there , above , way above the solar system , way beyond our solar system .
And here &apos;s the thing . Now you know how it got there .
Now you know why , and to me , that &apos;s the point of this program .
You can manipulate it yourself .
You can fly around yourself and you can learn for yourself .
You know , the theme today is &quot; The World In Your Grasp . &quot;
Well , we &apos;re trying to give you the solar system in your grasp ‚Äî ‚Äî and we hope once it &apos;s there , you &apos;ll be able to learn for yourself what we &apos;ve done out there , and what we &apos;re about to do .
And my personal dream is for kids to take this and explore and see the wonders out there and be inspired , as I was as a kid , to pursue STEM education and to pursue a dream in space exploration .
Thank you .

Andreas Raptopoulos : No roads ? There &apos;s a drone for that
A billion people in the world lack access to all-season roads . Could the structure of the internet provide a model for how to reach them ? Andreas Raptopoulos of Matternet thinks so . He introduces a new type of transportation system that uses electric autonomous flying machines to deliver medicine , food , goods and supplies wherever they are needed .
One billion people in the world today do not have access to all-season roads .
One billion people .
One seventh of the Earth &apos;s population are totally cut off for some part of the year .
We cannot get medicine to them reliably , they cannot get critical supplies , and they cannot get their goods to market in order to create a sustainable income .
In sub-Saharan Africa , for instance , 85 percent of roads are unusable in the wet season .
Investments are being made , but at the current level , it &apos;s estimated it &apos;s going to take them 50 years to catch up .
In the U.S. alone , there &apos;s more than four million miles of roads , very expensive to build , very expensive to maintain infrastructure , with a huge ecological footprint , and yet , very often , congested .
So we saw this and we thought , can there be a better way ?
Can we create a system using today &apos;s most advanced technologies that can allow this part of the world to leapfrog in the same way they &apos;ve done with mobile telephones in the last 10 years ?
Many of those nations have excellent telecommunications today without ever putting copper lines in the ground .
Could we do the same for transportation ?
Imagine this scenario .
Imagine you are in a maternity ward in Mali , and have a newborn in need of urgent medication .
What would you do today ?
Well , you would place a request via mobile phone , and someone would get the request immediately .
That &apos;s the part that works .
The medication may take days to arrive , though , because of bad roads .
That &apos;s the part that &apos;s broken .
We believe we can deliver it within hours with an electric autonomous flying vehicle such as this .
This can transport a small payload today , about two kilograms , over a short distance , about 10 kilometers , but it &apos;s part of a wider network that may cover the entire country , maybe even the entire continent .
It &apos;s an ultra-flexible , automated logistics network .
It &apos;s a network for a transportation of matter .
We call it Matternet .
We use three key technologies .
The first is electric autonomous flying vehicles .
The second is automated ground stations that the vehicles fly in and out of to swap batteries and fly farther , or pick up or deliver loads .
And the third is the operating system that manages the whole network .
Let &apos;s look at each one of those technologies in a bit more detail .
First of all , the UAVs .
Eventually , we &apos;re going to be using all sorts of vehicles for different payload capacities and different ranges .
Today , we &apos;re using small quads .
These are able to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers in just about 15 minutes .
Compare this with trying to trespass a bad road in the developing world , or even being stuck in traffic in a developed world country .
These fly autonomously .
This is the key to the technology .
So they use GPS and other sensors on board to navigate between ground stations .
Every vehicle is equipped with an automatic payload and battery exchange mechanism , so these vehicles navigate to those ground stations , they dock , swap a battery automatically , and go out again .
The ground stations are located on safe locations on the ground .
They secure the most vulnerable part of the mission , which is the landing .
They are at known locations on the ground , so the paths between them are also known , which is very important from a reliability perspective from the whole network .
Apart from fulfilling the energy requirements of the vehicles , eventually they &apos;re going to be becoming commercial hubs where people can take out loads or put loads into the network .
The last component is the operating system that manages the whole network .
It monitors weather data from all the ground stations and optimizes the routes of the vehicles through the system to avoid adverse weather conditions , avoid other risk factors , and optimize the use of the resources throughout the network .
I want to show you what one of those flights looks like .
Here we are flying in Haiti last summer , where we &apos;ve done our first field trials .
We &apos;re modeling here a medical delivery in a camp we set up after the 2010 earthquake .
People there love this .
And I want to show you what one of those vehicles looks like up close .
So this is a $ 3,000 vehicle .
Costs are coming down very rapidly .
We use this in all sorts of weather conditions , very hot and very cold climates , very strong winds . They &apos;re very sturdy vehicles .
Imagine if your life depended on this package , somewhere in Africa or in New York City , after Sandy .
The next big question is , what &apos;s the cost ?
Well , it turns out that the cost to transport two kilograms over 10 kilometers with this vehicle is just 24 cents .
And it &apos;s counterintuitive , but the cost of energy expended for the flight is only two cents of a dollar today , and we &apos;re just at the beginning of this .
When we saw this , we felt that this is something that can have significant impact in the world .
So we said , okay , how much does it cost to set up a network somewhere in the world ?
And we looked at setting up a network in Lesotho for transportation of HIV / AIDS samples .
The problem there is how do you take them from clinics where they &apos;re being collected to hospitals where they &apos;re being analyzed ?
And we said , what if we wanted to cover an area spanning around 140 square kilometers ?
That &apos;s roughly one and a half times the size of Manhattan .
Well it turns out that the cost to do that there would be less than a million dollars .
Compare this to normal infrastructure investments .
We think this can be -- this is the power of a new paradigm .
So here we are : a new idea about a network for transportation that is based on the ideas of the Internet .
It &apos;s decentralized , it &apos;s peer-to-peer , it &apos;s bidirectional , highly adaptable , with very low infrastructure investment , very low ecological footprint .
If it is a new paradigm , though , there must be other uses for it .
It can be used perhaps in other places in the world .
So let &apos;s look at the other end of the spectrum : our cities and megacities .
Half of the Earth &apos;s population lives in cities today .
Half a billion of us live in megacities .
We are living through an amazing urbanization trend .
China alone is adding a megacity the size of New York City every two years .
These are places that do have road infrastructure , but it &apos;s very inefficient .
Congestion is a huge problem .
So we think it makes sense in those places to set up a network of transportation that is a new layer that sits between the road and the Internet , initially for lightweight , urgent stuff , and over time , we would hope to develop this into a new mode of transportation that is truly a modern solution to a very old problem .
It &apos;s ultimately scalable with a very small ecological footprint , operating in the background 24 / 7 , just like the Internet .
So when we started this a couple of years ago now , we &apos;ve had a lot of people come up to us who said , &quot; This is a very interesting but crazy idea , and certainly not something that you should engage with anytime soon . &quot;
And of course , we &apos;re talking about drones , right , a technology that &apos;s not only unpopular in the West but one that has become a very , very unpleasant fact of life for many living in poor countries , especially those engaged in conflict .
So why are we doing this ?
Well , we chose to do this one not because it &apos;s easy , but because it can have amazing impact .
Imagine one billion people being connected to physical goods in the same way that mobile telecommunications connected them to information .
Imagine if the next big network we built in the world was a network for the transportation of matter .
In the developing world , we would hope to reach millions of people with better vaccines , reach them with better medication .
It would give us an unfair advantage against battling HIV / AIDS , tuberculosis and other epidemics .
Over time , we would hope it would become a new platform for economic transactions , lifting millions of people out of poverty .
In the developed world and the emerging world , we would hope it would become a new mode of transportation that could help make our cities more livable .
So for those that still believe that this is science fiction , I firmly say to you that it is not .
We do need to engage , though , in social fiction to make it happen .
Thank you .
Rives : Reinventing the encyclopedia game
Prompted by the Encyclopaedia Britannica ending its print publication , performance poet Rives resurrects a game from his childhood . Speaking at the TEDxSummit in Doha , Rives takes us on a charming tour through random bits of human knowledge : from Chimborazo , the farthest point from the center of the Earth , to Ham the Astrochimp , the first chimpanzee in outer space .
So , last month , the Encyclopaedia Britannica announced that it is going out of print after 244 years , which made me nostalgic , because I remember playing a game with the colossal encyclopedia set in my hometown library back when I was a kid , maybe 12 years old .
And I wondered if I could update that game , not just for modern methods , but for the modern me .
So I tried .
I went to an online encyclopedia , Wikipedia , and I entered the term &quot; Earth . &quot;
You can start anywhere , this time I chose Earth .
And the first rule of the game is pretty simple .
You just have to read the article until you find something you don &apos;t know , and preferably something your dad doesn &apos;t even know .
And in this case , I quickly found this : The furthest point from the center of the Earth is not the tip of Mount Everest , like I might have thought , it &apos;s the tip of this mountain : Mount Chimborazo in Ecuador .
The Earth spins , of course , as it travels around the sun , so the Earth bulges a little bit around the middle , like some Earthlings .
And even though Mount Chimborazo isn &apos;t the tallest mountain in the Andes , it &apos;s one degree away from the equator , it &apos;s riding that bulge , and so the summit of Chimborazo is the farthest point on Earth from the center of the Earth .
And it is really fun to say .
So I immediately decided , this is going to be the name of the game , or my new exclamation .
You can use it at TED .
Chimborazo , right ?
It &apos;s like &quot; eureka &quot; and &quot; bingo &quot; had a baby .
I didn &apos;t know that ; that &apos;s pretty cool .
Chimborazo !
So the next rule of the game is also pretty simple .
You just have to find another term and look that up .
Now in the old days , that meant getting out a volume and browsing through it alphabetically , maybe getting sidetracked , that was fun .
Nowadays there are hundreds of links to choose from .
I can go literally anywhere in the world , I think since I was already in Ecuador , I just decided to click on the word &quot; tropical . &quot;
That took me to this wet and warm band of the tropics that encircles the Earth .
Now that &apos;s the Tropic of Cancer in the north and the Tropic of Capricorn in the south , that much I knew , but I was surprised to learn this little fact : Those are not cartographers &apos; lines , like latitude or the borders between nations , they are astronomical phenomena caused by the Earth &apos;s tilt , and they change .
They move ; they go up , they go down .
In fact , for years , the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn have been steadily drifting towards the equator at the rate of about 15 meters per year , and nobody told me that .
I didn &apos;t know it .
Chimborazo !
So to keep the game going , I just have to find another term and look that one up .
Since I &apos;m already in the tropics , I chose &quot; Tropical rainforest . &quot;
Famous for its diversity , human diversity .
There are still dozens and dozens of uncontacted tribes living on this planet .
They &apos;re all over the globe , but virtually all of them live in tropical rainforests .
This is the only place you can go nowadays and not get &quot; friended . &quot;
The link that I clicked on here was exotic in the beginning and then absolutely mysterious at the very end .
It mentioned leopards and ring-tailed coatis and poison dart frogs and boa constrictors and then coleoptera , which turn out to be beetles .
Now I clicked on this on purpose , but if I &apos;d somehow gotten here by mistake , it does remind me , for the band , see &quot; The Beatles , &quot; for the car see &quot; Volkswagon Beetle , &quot; but I am here for beetle beetles .
This is the most successful order on the planet by far .
Something between 20 and 25 percent of all life forms on the planet , including plants , are beetles .
That means the next time you are in the grocery store , take a look at the four people ahead of you in line .
Statistically , one of you is a beetle .
And if it is you , you are astonishingly well adapted .
There are scavenger beetles that pick the skin and flesh off of bones in museums .
There are predator beetles , that attack other insects and still look pretty cute to us .
There are beetles that roll little balls of dung great distances across the desert floor to feed to their hatchlings .
This reminded the ancient Egyptians of their god Khepri , who renews the ball of the sun every morning , which is how that dung-rolling scarab became that sacred scarab on the breastplate of the Pharaoh Tutankhamun .
Beetles , I was reminded , have the most romantic flirtation in the animal kingdom .
Fireflies are not flies , fireflies are beetles .
Fireflies are coleoptera , and coleoptera communicate in other ways as well .
Like my next link : The chemical language of pheromones .
Now the pheromone page took me to a video of a sea urchin having sex .
Yeah .
And the link to aphrodisiac .
Now that &apos;s something that increases sexual desire , possibly chocolate .
There is a compound in chocolate called phenethylamine that might be an aphrodisiac .
But as the article mentions , because of enzyme breakdown , it &apos;s unlikely that phenethylamine will reach your brain if taken orally .
So those of you who only eat your chocolate , you might have to experiment .
The link I clicked on here , &quot; sympathetic magic , &quot; mostly because I understand what both of those words mean .
But not when they &apos;re together like that .
I do like sympathy . I do like magic .
So when I click on &quot; sympathetic magic , &quot; I get sympathetic magic and voodoo dolls .
This is the boy in me getting lucky again .
Sympathetic magic is imitation .
If you imitate something , maybe you can have an effect on it .
That &apos;s the idea behind voodoo dolls , and possibly also cave paintings .
The link to cave paintings takes me to some of the oldest art known to humankind .
I would love to see Google maps inside some of these caves .
We &apos;ve got tens-of-thousands-years-old artwork .
Common themes around the globe include large wild animals and tracings of human hands , usually the left hand .
We have been a dominantly right-handed tribe for millenia , so even though I don &apos;t know why a paleolithic person would trace his hand or blow pigment on it from a tube , I can easily picture how he did it .
And I really don &apos;t think it &apos;s that different form our own little dominant hand avatar right there that I &apos;m going to use now to click on the term for &quot; hand , &quot; go to the page for &quot; hand , &quot; where I found the most fun and possibly embarrassing bit of trivia I &apos;ve found in a long time . It &apos;s simply this : The back of the hand is formally called the opisthenar .
Now that &apos;s embarrassing , because up until now , every time I &apos;ve said , &quot; I know it like the back of my hand , &quot; I &apos;ve really been saying , &quot; I &apos;m totally familiar with that , I just don &apos;t know it &apos;s freaking name , right ? &quot;
And the link I clicked on here , well , lemurs , monkeys and chimpanzees have the little opisthenar .
I click on chimpanzee , and I get our closest genetic relative .
Pan troglodytes , the name we give him , means &quot; cave dweller . &quot;
He doesn &apos;t .
He lives in rainforests and savannas .
It &apos;s just that we &apos;re always thinking of this guy as lagging behind us , evolutionarily or somehow uncannily creeping up on us , and in some cases , he gets places before us .
Like my next link , the almost irresistible link , Ham the Astrochimp .
I click on him , and I really thought he was going to bring me full circle twice , in fact .
He &apos;s born in Cameroon , which is smack in the middle of my tropics map , and more specifically his skeleton wound up in the Smithsonian museum getting picked clean by beetles .
In between those two landmarks in Ham &apos;s life , he flew into space .
He experienced weightlessness and re-entry months before the first human being to do it , Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin .
When I click on Yuri Gagarin &apos;s page , I get this guy who was surprisingly short in stature , huge in heroism .
Top estimates , Soviet estimates , put this guy at 1.65 meters , that is less than five and a half feet tall max , possibly because he was malnourished as a child .
Germans occupied Russia .
A Nazi officer took over the Gagarin household , and he and his family built and lived in a mud hut .
Years later , the boy from that cramped mud hut would grow up to be the man in that cramped capsule on the tip of a rocket who volunteered to be launched into outer space , the first one of any of us to really physically leave this planet .
And he didn &apos;t just leave it , he circled it once .
Fifty years later , as a tribute , the International Space Station , which is still up there tonight , synced its orbit with Gagarin &apos;s orbit , at the exact same time of day , and filmed it , so you can go online and you can watch over 100 minutes of what must have been an absolutely mesmerizing ride , possibly a lonely one , the first person to ever see such a thing .
And then when you &apos;ve had your fill of that , you can click on one more link .
You can come back to Earth .
You return to where you started .
You can finish your game .
You just need to find one more fact that you didn &apos;t know .
And for me , I quickly landed on this one : The Earth has a tolerance of about .17 percent from the reference spheroid , which is less than the .22 percent allowed in billiard balls .
This is the kind of fact I would have loved as a boy .
I found it myself .
It &apos;s got some math that I can do .
I &apos;m pretty sure my dad doesn &apos;t know it .
What this means is that if you could shrink the Earth to the size of a billiard ball , if you could take planet Earth , with all its mountain tops and caves and rainforests , astronauts and uncontacted tribes and chimpanzees , voodoo dolls , fireflies , chocolate , sea creatures making love in the deep blue sea , you just shrink that to the size of a billiard ball , it would be as smooth as a billiard ball , presumably a billiard ball with a slight bulge around the middle .
That &apos;s pretty cool .
I didn &apos;t know that .
Chimborazo !
Thank you .
Fiorenzo Omenetto : Silk , the ancient material of the future
Fiorenzo Omenetto shares 20 + astonishing new uses for silk , one of nature &apos;s most elegant materials -- in transmitting light , improving sustainability , adding strength and making medical leaps and bounds . On stage , he shows a few intriguing items made of the versatile stuff .
Thank you .
I &apos;m thrilled to be here .
I &apos;m going to talk about a new , old material that still continues to amaze us , and that might impact the way we think about material science , high technology -- and maybe , along the way , also do some stuff for medicine and for global health and help reforestation .
So that &apos;s kind of a bold statement .
I &apos;ll tell you a little bit more .
This material actually has some traits that make it seem almost too good to be true .
It &apos;s sustainable ; it &apos;s a sustainable material that is processed all in water and at room temperature -- and is biodegradable with a clock , so you can watch it dissolve instantaneously in a glass of water or have it stable for years .
It &apos;s edible ; it &apos;s implantable in the human body without causing any immune response .
It actually gets reintegrated in the body .
And it &apos;s technological , so it can do things like microelectronics , and maybe photonics do .
And the material looks something like this .
In fact , this material you see is clear and transparent .
The components of this material are just water and protein .
So this material is silk .
So it &apos;s kind of different from what we &apos;re used to thinking about silk .
So the question is , how do you reinvent something that has been around for five millennia ?
The process of discovery , generally , is inspired by nature .
And so we marvel at silk worms -- the silk worm you see here spinning its fiber .
The silk worm does a remarkable thing : it uses these two ingredients , protein and water , that are in its gland , to make a material that is exceptionally tough for protection -- so comparable to technical fibers like Kevlar .
And so in the reverse engineering process that we know about , and that we &apos;re familiar with , for the textile industry , the textile industry goes and unwinds the cocoon and then weaves glamorous things .
We want to know how you go from water and protein to this liquid Kevlar , to this natural Kevlar .
So the insight is how do you actually reverse engineer this and go from cocoon to gland and get water and protein that is your starting material .
And this is an insight that came , about two decades ago , from a person that I &apos;m very fortunate to work with , David Kaplan .
And so we get this starting material .
And so this starting material is back to the basic building block .
And then we use this to do a variety of things -- like , for example , this film .
And we take advantage of something that is very simple .
The recipe to make those films is to take advantage of the fact that proteins are extremely smart at what they do .
They find their way to self-assemble .
So the recipe is simple : you take the silk solution , you pour it , and you wait for the protein to self-assemble .
And then you detach the protein and you get this film , as the proteins find each other as the water evaporates .
But I mentioned that the film is also technological .
And so what does that mean ?
It means that you can interface it with some of the things that are typical of technology , like microelectronics and nanoscale technology .
And the image of the DVD here is just to illustrate a point that silk follows very subtle topographies of the surface , which means that it can replicate features on the nanoscale .
So it would be able to replicate the information that is on the DVD .
And we can store information that &apos;s film with water and protein .
So we tried something out , and we wrote a message in a piece of silk , which is right here , and the message is over there .
And much like in the DVD , you can read it out optically .
And this requires a stable hand , so this is why I decided to do it onstage in front of a thousand people .
So let me see .
So as you see the film go in transparently through there , and then ...
And the most remarkable feat is that my hand actually stayed still long enough to do that .
So once you have these attributes of this material , then you can do a lot of things .
It &apos;s actually not limited to films .
And so the material can assume a lot of formats .
And then you go a little crazy , and so you do various optical components or you do microprism arrays , like the reflective tape that you have on your running shoes .
Or you can do beautiful things that , if the camera can capture , you can make .
You can add a third dimensionality to the film .
And if the angle is right , you can actually see a hologram appear in this film of silk .
But you can do other things .
You can imagine that then maybe you can use a pure protein to guide light , and so we &apos;ve made optical fibers .
But silk is versatile and it goes beyond optics .
And you can think of different formats .
So for instance , if you &apos;re afraid of going to the doctor and getting stuck with a needle , we do microneedle arrays .
What you see there on the screen is a human hair superimposed on the needle that &apos;s made of silk -- just to give you a sense of size .
You can do bigger things .
You can do gears and nuts and bolts -- that you can buy at Whole Foods .
And the gears work in water as well .
So you think of alternative mechanical parts .
And maybe you can use that liquid Kevlar if you need something strong to replace peripheral veins , for example , or maybe an entire bone .
And so you have here a little example of a small skull -- what we call mini Yorick .
But you can do things like cups , for example , and so , if you add a little bit of gold , if you add a little bit of semiconductors you could do sensors that stick on the surfaces of foods .
You can do electronic pieces that fold and wrap .
Or if you &apos;re fashion forward , some silk LED tattoos .
So there &apos;s versatility , as you see , in the material formats , that you can do with silk .
But there are still some unique traits .
I mean , why would you want to do all these things for real ?
I mentioned it briefly at the beginning ; the protein is biodegradable and biocompatible .
And you see here a picture of a tissue section .
And so what does that mean , that it &apos;s biodegradable and biocompatible ?
You can implant it in the body without needing to retrieve what is implanted .
Which means that all the devices that you &apos;ve seen before and all the formats , in principle , can be implanted and disappear .
And what you see there in that tissue section , in fact , is you see that reflector tape .
So , much like you &apos;re seen at night by a car , then the idea is that you can see , if you illuminate tissue , you can see deeper parts of tissue because there is that reflective tape there that is made out of silk .
And you see there , it gets reintegrated in tissue .
And reintegration in the human body is not the only thing , but reintegration in the environment is important .
So you have a clock , you have protein , and now a silk cup like this can be thrown away without guilt -- unlike the polystyrene cups that unfortunately fill our landfills everyday .
It &apos;s edible , so you can do smart packaging around food that you can cook with the food .
It doesn &apos;t taste good , so I &apos;m going to need some help with that .
But probably the most remarkable thing is that it comes full circle .
Silk , during its self-assembly process , acts like a cocoon for biological matter .
And so if you change the recipe , and you add things when you pour -- so you add things to your liquid silk solution -- where these things are enzymes or antibodies or vaccines , the self-assembly process preserves the biological function of these dopants .
So it makes the materials environmentally active and interactive .
So that screw that you thought about beforehand can actually be used to screw a bone together -- a fractured bone together -- and deliver drugs at the same , while your bone is healing , for example .
Or you could put drugs in your wallet and not in your fridge .
So we &apos;ve made a silk card with penicillin in it .
And we stored penicillin at 60 degrees C , so 140 degrees Fahrenheit , for two months without loss of efficacy of the penicillin .
And so that could be --- that could be potentially a good alternative to solar powered refrigerated camels .
And of course , there &apos;s no use in storage if you can &apos;t use &#91; it &#93; .
And so there is this other unique material trait that these materials have , that they &apos;re programmably degradable .
And so what you see there is the difference .
In the top , you have a film that has been programmed not to degrade , and in the bottom , a film that has been programmed to degrade in water .
And what you see is that the film on the bottom releases what is inside it .
So it allows for the recovery of what we &apos;ve stored before .
And so this allows for a controlled delivery of drugs and for reintegration in the environment in all of these formats that you &apos;ve seen .
So the thread of discovery that we have really is a thread .
We &apos;re impassioned with this idea that whatever you want to do , whether you want to replace a vein or a bone , or maybe be more sustainable in microelectronics , perhaps drink a coffee in a cup and throw it away without guilt , maybe carry your drugs in your pocket , deliver them inside your body or deliver them across the desert , the answer may be in a thread of silk .
Thank you .
Sandra Aamodt : Why dieting doesn &apos;t usually work
In the US , 80 % of girls have been on a diet by the time they &apos;re 10 years old . In this honest , raw talk , neuroscientist Sandra Aamodt uses her personal story to frame an important lesson about how our brains manage our bodies , as she explores the science behind why dieting not only doesn &apos;t work , but is likely to do more harm than good . She suggests ideas for how to live a less diet-obsessed life , intuitively .
Three and a half years ago , I made one of the best decisions of my life .
As my New Year &apos;s resolution , I gave up dieting , stopped worrying about my weight , and learned to eat mindfully .
Now I eat whenever I &apos;m hungry , and I &apos;ve lost 10 pounds .
This was me at age 13 , when I started my first diet .
I look at that picture now , and I think , you did not need a diet , you needed a fashion consult .
But I thought I needed to lose weight , and when I gained it back , of course I blamed myself .
And for the next three decades , I was on and off various diets .
No matter what I tried , the weight I &apos;d lost always came back .
I &apos;m sure many of you know the feeling .
As a neuroscientist , I wondered , why is this so hard ?
Obviously , how much you weigh depends on how much you eat and how much energy you burn .
What most people don &apos;t realize is that hunger and energy use are controlled by the brain , mostly without your awareness .
Your brain does a lot of its work behind the scenes , and that is a good thing , because your conscious mind -- how do we put this politely ? -- it &apos;s easily distracted .
It &apos;s good that you don &apos;t have to remember to breathe when you get caught up in a movie .
You don &apos;t forget how to walk because you &apos;re thinking about what to have for dinner .
Your brain also has its own sense of what you should weigh , no matter what you consciously believe .
This is called your set point , but that &apos;s a misleading term , because it &apos;s actually a range of about 10 or 15 pounds .
You can use lifestyle choices to move your weight up and down within that range , but it &apos;s much , much harder to stay outside of it .
The hypothalamus , the part of the brain that regulates body weight , there are more than a dozen chemical signals in the brain that tell your body to gain weight , more than another dozen that tell your body to lose it , and the system works like a thermostat , responding to signals from the body by adjusting hunger , activity and metabolism , to keep your weight stable as conditions change .
That &apos;s what a thermostat does , right ?
It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside .
Now you can try to change the temperature in your house by opening a window in the winter , but that &apos;s not going to change the setting on the thermostat , which will respond by kicking on the furnace to warm the place back up .
Your brain works exactly the same way , responding to weight loss by using powerful tools to push your body back to what it considers normal .
If you lose a lot of weight , your brain reacts as if you were starving , and whether you started out fat or thin , your brain &apos;s response is exactly the same .
We would love to think that your brain could tell whether you need to lose weight or not , but it can &apos;t .
If you do lose a lot of weight , you become hungry , and your muscles burn less energy .
Dr. Rudy Leibel of Columbia University has found that people who have lost 10 percent of their body weight burn 250 to 400 calories less because their metabolism is suppressed .
That &apos;s a lot of food .
This means that a successful dieter must eat this much less forever than someone of the same weight who has always been thin .
From an evolutionary perspective , your body &apos;s resistance to weight loss makes sense .
When food was scarce , our ancestors &apos; survival depended on conserving energy , and regaining the weight when food was available would have protected them against the next shortage .
Over the course of human history , starvation has been a much bigger problem than overeating .
This may explain a very sad fact : Set points can go up , but they rarely go down .
Now , if your mother ever mentioned that life is not fair , this is the kind of thing she was talking about .
Successful dieting doesn &apos;t lower your set point .
Even after you &apos;ve kept the weight off for as long as seven years , your brain keeps trying to make you gain it back .
If that weight loss had been due to a long famine , that would be a sensible response .
In our modern world of drive-thru burgers , it &apos;s not working out so well for many of us .
That difference between our ancestral past and our abundant present is the reason that Dr. Yoni Freedhoff of the University of Ottawa would like to take some of his patients back to a time when food was less available , and it &apos;s also the reason that changing the food environment is really going to be the most effective solution to obesity .
Sadly , a temporary weight gain can become permanent .
If you stay at a high weight for too long , probably a matter of years for most of us , your brain may decide that that &apos;s the new normal .
Psychologists classify eaters into two groups , those who rely on their hunger and those who try to control their eating through willpower , like most dieters .
Let &apos;s call them intuitive eaters and controlled eaters .
The interesting thing is that intuitive eaters are less likely to be overweight , and they spend less time thinking about food .
Controlled eaters are more vulnerable to overeating in response to advertising , super-sizing , and the all-you-can-eat buffet .
And a small indulgence , like eating one scoop of ice cream , is more likely to lead to a food binge in controlled eaters .
Children are especially vulnerable to this cycle of dieting and then binging .
Several long-term studies have shown that girls who diet in their early teenage years are three times more likely to become overweight five years later , even if they started at a normal weight , and all of these studies found that the same factors that predicted weight gain also predicted the development of eating disorders .
The other factor , by the way , those of you who are parents , was being teased by family members about their weight .
So don &apos;t do that .
I left almost all my graphs at home , but I couldn &apos;t resist throwing in just this one , because I &apos;m a geek , and that &apos;s how I roll .
This is a study that looked at the risk of death over a 14-year period based on four healthy habits : eating enough fruits and vegetables , exercise three times a week , not smoking , and drinking in moderation .
Let &apos;s start by looking at the normal weight people in the study .
The height of the bars is the risk of death , and those zero , one , two , three , four numbers on the horizontal axis are the number of those healthy habits that a given person had .
And as you &apos;d expect , the healthier the lifestyle , the less likely people were to die during the study .
Now let &apos;s look at what happens in overweight people .
The ones that had no healthy habits had a higher risk of death .
Adding just one healthy habit pulls overweight people back into the normal range .
For obese people with no healthy habits , the risk is very high , seven times higher than the healthiest groups in the study .
But a healthy lifestyle helps obese people too .
In fact , if you look only at the group with all four healthy habits , you can see that weight makes very little difference .
You can take control of your health by taking control of your lifestyle , even If you can &apos;t lose weight and keep it off .
Diets don &apos;t have very much reliability .
Five years after a diet , most people have regained the weight .
Forty percent of them have gained even more .
If you think about this , the typical outcome of dieting is that you &apos;re more likely to gain weight in the long run than to lose it .
If I &apos;ve convinced you that dieting might be a problem , the next question is , what do you do about it ?
And my answer , in a word , is mindfulness .
I &apos;m not saying you need to learn to meditate or take up yoga .
I &apos;m talking about mindful eating : learning to understand your body &apos;s signals so that you eat when you &apos;re hungry and stop when you &apos;re full , because a lot of weight gain boils down to eating when you &apos;re not hungry .
How do you do it ?
Give yourself permission to eat as much as you want , and then work on figuring out what makes your body feel good .
Sit down to regular meals without distractions .
Think about how your body feels when you start to eat and when you stop , and let your hunger decide when you should be done .
It took about a year for me to learn this , but it &apos;s really been worth it .
I am so much more relaxed around food than I have ever been in my life .
I often don &apos;t think about it .
I forget we have chocolate in the house .
It &apos;s like aliens have taken over my brain .
It &apos;s just completely different .
I should say that this approach to eating probably won &apos;t make you lose weight unless you often eat when you &apos;re not hungry , but doctors don &apos;t know of any approach that makes significant weight loss in a lot of people , and that is why a lot of people are now focusing on preventing weight gain instead of promoting weight loss .
Let &apos;s face it : If diets worked , we &apos;d all be thin already .
Why do we keep doing the same thing and expecting different results ?
Diets may seem harmless , but they actually do a lot of collateral damage .
At worst , they ruin lives : Weight obsession leads to eating disorders , especially in young kids .
In the U.S. , we have 80 percent of 10-year-old girls say they &apos;ve been on a diet .
Our daughters have learned to measure their worth by the wrong scale .
Even at its best , dieting is a waste of time and energy .
It takes willpower which you could be using to help your kids with their homework or to finish that important work project , and because willpower is limited , any strategy that relies on its consistent application is pretty much guaranteed to eventually fail you when your attention moves on to something else .
Let me leave you with one last thought .
What if we told all those dieting girls that it &apos;s okay to eat when they &apos;re hungry ?
What if we taught them to work with their appetite instead of fearing it ?
I think most of them would be happier and healthier , and as adults , many of them would probably be thinner .
I wish someone had told me that back when I was 13 .
Thanks .
Lee Cronin : Print your own medicine
Chemist Lee Cronin is working on a 3D printer that , instead of objects , is able to print molecules . An exciting potential long-term application : printing your own medicine using chemical inks .
Organic chemists make molecules , very complicated molecules , by chopping up a big molecule into small molecules and reverse engineering .
And as a chemist , one of the things I wanted to ask my research group a couple of years ago is , could we make a really cool universal chemistry set ?
In essence , could we &quot; app &quot; chemistry ?
Now what would this mean , and how would we do it ?
Well to start to do this , we took a 3D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware .
And so by printing the vessel and doing the chemistry at the same time , we may start to access this universal toolkit of chemistry .
Now what could this mean ?
Well if we can embed biological and chemical networks like a search engine , so if you have a cell that &apos;s ill that you need to cure or bacteria that you want to kill , if you have this embedded in your device at the same time , and you do the chemistry , you may be able to make drugs in a new way .
So how are we doing this in the lab ?
Well it requires software , it requires hardware and it requires chemical inks .
And so the really cool bit is , the idea is that we want to have a universal set of inks that we put out with the printer , and you download the blueprint , the organic chemistry for that molecule and you make it in the device .
And so you can make your molecule in the printer using this software .
So what could this mean ?
Well , ultimately , it could mean that you could print your own medicine .
And this is what we &apos;re doing in the lab at the moment .
But to take baby steps to get there , first of all we want to look at drug design and production , or drug discovery and manufacturing .
Because if we can manufacture it after we &apos;ve discovered it , we could deploy it anywhere .
You don &apos;t need to go to the chemist anymore .
We can print drugs at point of need .
We can download new diagnostics .
Say a new super bug has emerged .
You put it in your search engine , and you create the drug to treat the threat .
So this allows you on-the-fly molecular assembly .
But perhaps for me the core bit going into the future is this idea of taking your own stem cells , with your genes and your environment , and you print your own personal medicine .
And if that doesn &apos;t seem fanciful enough , where do you think we &apos;re going to go ?
Well , you &apos;re going to have your own personal matter fabricator .
Beam me up , Scotty .
Eli Pariser : Beware online &quot; filter bubbles &quot;
As web companies strive to tailor their services to our personal tastes , there &apos;s a dangerous unintended consequence : We get trapped in a &quot; filter bubble &quot; and don &apos;t get exposed to information that could challenge or broaden our worldview . Eli Pariser argues powerfully that this will ultimately prove to be bad for us and bad for democracy .
Mark Zuckerberg , a journalist was asking him a question about the news feed .
And the journalist was asking him , &quot; Why is this so important ? &quot;
And Zuckerberg said , &quot; A squirrel dying in your front yard may be more relevant to your interests right now than people dying in Africa . &quot;
And I want to talk about what a Web based on that idea of relevance might look like .
So when I was growing up in a really rural area in Maine , the Internet meant something very different to me .
It meant a connection to the world .
It meant something that would connect us all together .
And I was sure that it was going to be great for democracy and for our society .
But there &apos;s this shift in how information is flowing online , and it &apos;s invisible .
And if we don &apos;t pay attention to it , it could be a real problem .
So I first noticed this in a place I spend a lot of time -- my Facebook page .
I &apos;m progressive , politically -- big surprise -- but I &apos;ve always gone out of my way to meet conservatives .
I like hearing what they &apos;re thinking about ; I like seeing what they link to ; I like learning a thing or two .
And so I was surprised when I noticed one day that the conservatives had disappeared from my Facebook feed .
was that Facebook was looking at which links I clicked on , and it was noticing that , actually , I was clicking more on my liberal friends &apos; links than on my conservative friends &apos; links .
And without consulting me about it , it had edited them out .
They disappeared .
So Facebook isn &apos;t the only place that &apos;s doing this kind of invisible , algorithmic editing of the Web .
Google &apos;s doing it too .
If I search for something , and you search for something , even right now at the very same time , we may get very different search results .
Even if you &apos;re logged out , one engineer told me , there are 57 signals that Google looks at -- everything from what kind of computer you &apos;re on to what kind of browser you &apos;re using to where you &apos;re located -- that it uses to personally tailor your query results .
Think about it for a second : there is no standard Google anymore .
And you know , the funny thing about this is that it &apos;s hard to see .
You can &apos;t see how different your search results are from anyone else &apos;s .
But a couple of weeks ago , I asked a bunch of friends to Google &quot; Egypt &quot; and to send me screen shots of what they got .
So here &apos;s my friend Scott &apos;s screen shot .
And here &apos;s my friend Daniel &apos;s screen shot .
When you put them side-by-side , you don &apos;t even have to read the links to see how different these two pages are .
But when you do read the links , it &apos;s really quite remarkable .
Daniel didn &apos;t get anything about the protests in Egypt at all in his first page of Google results .
Scott &apos;s results were full of them .
And this was the big story of the day at that time .
That &apos;s how different these results are becoming .
So it &apos;s not just Google and Facebook either .
This is something that &apos;s sweeping the Web .
There are a whole host of companies that are doing this kind of personalization .
Yahoo News , the biggest news site on the Internet , is now personalized -- different people get different things .
Huffington Post , the Washington Post , the New York Times -- all flirting with personalization in various ways .
And this moves us very quickly toward a world in which the Internet is showing us what it thinks we want to see , but not necessarily what we need to see .
As Eric Schmidt said , &quot; It will be very hard for people to watch or consume something that has not in some sense been tailored for them . &quot;
So I do think this is a problem .
And I think , if you take all of these filters together , you take all these algorithms , you get what I call a filter bubble .
And your filter bubble is your own personal , unique universe of information that you live in online .
And what &apos;s in your filter bubble depends on who you are , and it depends on what you do .
But the thing is that you don &apos;t decide what gets in .
And more importantly , you don &apos;t actually see what gets edited out .
So one of the problems with the filter bubble was discovered by some researchers at Netflix .
And they were looking at the Netflix queues , and they noticed something kind of funny that a lot of us probably have noticed , which is there are some movies that just sort of zip right up and out to our houses .
They enter the queue , they just zip right out .
So &quot; Iron Man &quot; zips right out , and &quot; Waiting for Superman &quot; can wait for a really long time .
What they discovered was that in our Netflix queues there &apos;s this epic struggle going on between our future aspirational selves and our more impulsive present selves .
You know we all want to be someone who has watched &quot; Rashomon , &quot; but right now we want to watch &quot; Ace Ventura &quot; for the fourth time .
So the best editing gives us a bit of both .
It gives us a little bit of Justin Bieber and a little bit of Afghanistan .
It gives us some information vegetables ; it gives us some information dessert .
And the challenge with these kinds of algorithmic filters , these personalized filters , is that , because they &apos;re mainly looking at what you click on first , it can throw off that balance .
And instead of a balanced information diet , you can end up surrounded by information junk food .
What this suggests is actually that we may have the story about the Internet wrong .
In a broadcast society -- this is how the founding mythology goes -- in a broadcast society , there were these gatekeepers , the editors , and they controlled the flows of information .
And along came the Internet and it swept them out of the way , and it allowed all of us to connect together , and it was awesome .
But that &apos;s not actually what &apos;s happening right now .
What we &apos;re seeing is more of a passing of the torch from human gatekeepers to algorithmic ones .
And the thing is that the algorithms don &apos;t yet have the kind of embedded ethics that the editors did .
So if algorithms are going to curate the world for us , if they &apos;re going to decide what we get to see and what we don &apos;t get to see , then we need to make sure that they &apos;re not just keyed to relevance .
We need to make sure that they also show us things that are uncomfortable or challenging or important -- this is what TED does -- other points of view .
And the thing is , we &apos;ve actually been here before as a society .
In 1915 , it &apos;s not like newspapers were sweating a lot about their civic responsibilities .
Then people noticed that they were doing something really important .
That , in fact , you couldn &apos;t have a functioning democracy if citizens didn &apos;t get a good flow of information , that the newspapers were critical because they were acting as the filter , and then journalistic ethics developed .
It wasn &apos;t perfect , but it got us through the last century .
And so now , we &apos;re kind of back in 1915 on the Web .
And we need the new gatekeepers to encode that kind of responsibility into the code that they &apos;re writing .
I know that there are a lot of people here from Facebook and from Google -- Larry and Sergey -- people who have helped build the Web as it is , and I &apos;m grateful for that .
But we really need you to make sure that these algorithms have encoded in them a sense of the public life , a sense of civic responsibility .
We need you to make sure that they &apos;re transparent enough that we can see what the rules are that determine what gets through our filters .
And we need you to give us some control so that we can decide what gets through and what doesn &apos;t .
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
We need it to connect us all together .
We need it to introduce us to new ideas and new people and different perspectives .
And it &apos;s not going to do that if it leaves us all isolated in a Web of one .
Thank you .
Alan Russell : The potential of regenerative medicine
Alan Russell studies regenerative medicine -- a breakthrough way of thinking about disease and injury , using a process that can signal the body to rebuild itself .
I &apos;m going to talk to you today about hopefully converting fear into hope .
When we go to the physician today -- when we go to the doctor &apos;s office and we walk in , there are words that we just don &apos;t want to hear .
There are words that we &apos;re truly afraid of .
Diabetes , cancer , Parkinson &apos;s , Alzheimer &apos;s , heart failure , lung failure -- things that we know are debilitating diseases , for which there &apos;s relatively little that can be done .
And what I want to lay out for you today is a different way of thinking about how to treat debilitating disease , why it &apos;s important , why without it perhaps our health care system will melt down if you think it already hasn &apos;t , and where we are clinically today , and where we might go tomorrow , and what some of the hurdles are .
And we &apos;re going to do all of that in 18 minutes , I promise .
I want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it .
This was an issue from 2002 that they published with a lot of different articles on the bionic human .
It was basically a regenerative medicine issue .
Regenerative medicine is an extraordinarily simple concept that everybody can understand .
It &apos;s simply accelerating the pace at which the body heals itself to a clinically relevant timescale .
So we know how to do this in many of the ways that are up there .
We know that if we have a damaged hip , you can put an artificial hip in .
And this is the idea that Science Magazine used on their front cover .
This is the complete antithesis of regenerative medicine .
This is not regenerative medicine .
Regenerative medicine is what Business Week put up when they did a story about regenerative medicine not too long ago .
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and I &apos;ll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that , we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue .
So that at the end of the treatment , you are the same as you were at the beginning of the treatment .
Very few good ideas -- if you agree that this is a good idea -- very few good ideas are truly novel .
And this is just the same .
If you look back in history , Charles Lindbergh , who was better known for flying airplanes , was actually one of the first people along with Alexis Carrel , one of the Nobel Laureates from Rockefeller , to begin to think about , could you culture organs ?
And they published this book in 1937 , where they actually began to think about , what could you do in bio-reactors to grow whole organs ?
We &apos;ve come a long way since then .
I &apos;m going to share with you some of the exciting work that &apos;s going on .
But before doing that , what I &apos;d like to do is share my depression about the health care system and the need for this with you .
Many of the talks yesterday talked about improving the quality of life , and reducing poverty , and essentially increasing life expectancy all around the globe .
One of the challenges is that the richer we are , the longer we live .
And the longer we live , the more expensive it is to take care of our diseases as we get older .
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65 .
And you can basically see that the richer a country is , the older the people are within it .
Why is this important ?
And why is this a particularly dramatic challenge right now ?
If the average age of your population is 30 , then the average kind of disease that you have to treat is maybe a broken ankle every now and again , maybe a little bit of asthma .
If the average age in your country is 45 to 55 , now the average person is looking at diabetes , early-onset diabetes , heart failure , coronary artery disease -- things that are inherently more difficult to treat , and much more expensive to treat .
Just have a look at the demographics in the U.S. here .
This is from &quot; The Untied States of America . &quot;
In 1930 , there were 41 workers per retiree .
41 people who were basically outside of being really sick , paying for the one retiree who was experiencing debilitating disease .
In 2010 , two workers per retiree in the U.S.
And this is matched in every industrialized , wealthy country in the world .
How can you actually afford to treat patients when the reality of getting old looks like this ?
This is age versus cost of health care .
And you can see that right around age 45 , 40 to 45 , there &apos;s a sudden spike in the cost of health care .
It &apos;s actually quite interesting . If you do the right studies , you can look at how much you as an individual spend on your own health care , plotted over your lifetime .
And about seven years before you &apos;re about to die , there &apos;s a spike .
And you can actually -- -- we won &apos;t get into that .
There are very few things , very few things that you can really do that will change the way that you can treat these kinds of diseases and experience what I would call healthy aging .
I &apos;d suggest there are four things , and none of these things include an insurance system or a legal system .
All those things do is change who pays .
They don &apos;t actually change what the actual cost of the treatment is .
One thing you can do is not treat . You can ration health care .
We won &apos;t talk about that anymore . It &apos;s too depressing .
You can prevent .
Obviously a lot of monies should be put into prevention .
But perhaps most interesting , to me anyway , and most important , is the idea of diagnosing a disease much earlier on in the progression , and then treating the disease to cure the disease instead of treating a symptom .
Think of it in terms of diabetes , for instance .
Today , with diabetes , what do we do ?
We diagnose the disease eventually , once it becomes symptomatic , and then we treat the symptom for 10 , 20 , 30 , 40 years .
And we do OK . Insulin &apos;s a pretty good therapy .
But eventually it stops working , and diabetes leads to a predictable onset of debilitating disease .
Why couldn &apos;t we just inject the pancreas with something to regenerate the pancreas early on in the disease , perhaps even before it was symptomatic ?
And it might be a little bit expensive at the time that we did it , but if it worked , we would truly be able to do something different .
This video , I think , gets across the concept that I &apos;m talking about quite dramatically .
This is a newt re-growing its limb .
If a newt can do this kind of thing , why can &apos;t we ?
I &apos;ll actually show you some more important features about limb regeneration in a moment .
But what we &apos;re talking about in regenerative medicine is doing this in every organ system of the body , for tissues and for organs themselves .
So today &apos;s reality is that if we get sick , the message is we will treat your symptoms , and you need to adjust to a new way of life .
I would pose to you that tomorrow -- and when tomorrow is we could debate , but it &apos;s within the foreseeable future -- we will talk about regenerative rehabilitation .
There &apos;s a limb prosthetic up here , similar actually one on the soldier that &apos;s come back from Iraq .
There are 370 soldiers that have come back from Iraq that have lost limbs .
Imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb .
It &apos;s a wild concept .
I &apos;ll show you where we are at the moment in working towards that concept .
But it &apos;s applicable , again , to every organ system .
How can we do that ?
The way to do that is to develop a conversation with the body .
We need to learn to speak the body &apos;s language .
And to switch on processes that we knew how to do when we were a fetus .
A mammalian fetus , if it loses a limb during the first trimester of pregnancy , will re-grow that limb .
So our DNA has the capacity to do these kinds of wound-healing mechanisms .
It &apos;s a natural process , but it is lost as we age .
In a child , before the age of about six months , if they lose their fingertip in an accident , they &apos;ll re-grow their fingertip .
By the time they &apos;re five , they won &apos;t be able to do that anymore .
So to engage in that conversation with the body , we need to speak the body &apos;s language .
And there are certain tools in our toolbox that allow us to do this today .
I &apos;m going to give you an example of three of these tools through which to converse with the body .
The first is cellular therapies .
Clearly , we heal ourselves in a natural process , using cells to do most of the work .
Therefore , if we can find the right cells and implant them in the body , they may do the healing .
Secondly , we can use materials .
We heard yesterday about the importance of new materials .
If we can invent materials , design materials , or extract materials from a natural environment , then we might be able to have those materials induce the body to heal itself .
And finally , we may be able to use smart devices that will offload the work of the body and allow it to heal .
I &apos;m going to show you an example of each of these , and I &apos;m going to start with materials .
Steve Badylak -- who &apos;s at the University of Pittsburgh -- about a decade ago had a remarkable idea .
And that idea was that the small intestine of a pig , if you threw away all the cells , and if you did that in a way that allowed it to remain biologically active , may contain all of the necessary factors and signals that would signal the body to heal itself .
And he asked a very important question .
He asked the question , if I take that material , which is a natural material that usually induces healing in the small intestine , and I place it somewhere else on a person &apos;s body , would it give a tissue-specific response , or would it make small intestine if I tried to make a new ear ?
I wouldn &apos;t be telling you this story if it weren &apos;t compelling .
The picture I &apos;m about to show you is a compelling picture .
However , for those of you that are even the slightest bit squeamish -- even though you may not like to admit it in front of your friends -- the lights are down . This is a good time to look at your feet , check your Blackberry , do anything other than look at the screen .
What I &apos;m about to show you is a diabetic ulcer .
And although -- it &apos;s good to laugh before we look at this .
This is the reality of diabetes .
I think a lot of times we hear about diabetics , diabetic ulcers , we just don &apos;t connect the ulcer with the eventual treatment , which is amputation , if you can &apos;t heal it .
So I &apos;m going to put the slide up now . It won &apos;t be up for long .
This is a diabetic ulcer . It &apos;s tragic .
The treatment for this is amputation .
This is an older lady . She has cancer of the liver as well as diabetes , and has decided to die with what &apos; s left of her body intact .
And this lady decided , after a year of attempted treatment of that ulcer , that she would try this new therapy that Steve invented .
That &apos;s what the wound looked like 11 weeks later .
That material contained only natural signals .
And that material induced the body to switch back on a healing response that it didn &apos;t have before .
There &apos;s going to be a couple more distressing slides for those of you -- I &apos;ll let you know when you can look again .
This is a horse . The horse is not in pain .
If the horse was in pain , I wouldn &apos;t show you this slide .
The horse just has another nostril that &apos;s developed because of a riding accident .
Just a few weeks after treatment -- in this case , taking that material , turning it into a gel , and packing that area , and then repeating the treatment a few times -- and the horse heals up .
And if you took an ultrasound of that area , it would look great .
Here &apos;s a dolphin where the fin &apos;s been re-attached .
There are now 400,000 patients around the world who have used that material to heal their wounds .
Could you regenerate a limb ?
DARPA just gave Steve 15 million dollars to lead an eight-institution project to begin the process of asking that question .
And I &apos;ll show you the 15 million dollar picture .
This is a 78 year-old man who &apos;s lost the end of his fingertip .
Remember that I mentioned before the children who lose their fingertips .
After treatment that &apos;s what it looks like .
This is happening today .
This is clinically relevant today .
There are materials that do this . Here are the heart patches .
But could you go a little further ?
Could you , say , instead of using material , can I take some cells along with the material , and remove a damaged piece of tissue , put a bio-degradable material on there ?
You can see here a little bit of heart muscle beating in a dish .
This was done by Teruo Okano at Tokyo Women &apos;s Hospital .
He can actually grow beating tissue in a dish .
He chills the dish , it changes its properties and he peels it right out of the dish .
It &apos;s the coolest stuff .
Now I &apos;m going to show you cell-based regeneration .
And what I &apos;m going to show you here is stem cells being removed from the hip of a patient .
Again , if you &apos;re squeamish , you don &apos;t want to watch .
But this one &apos;s kind of cool .
So this is a bypass operation , just like what Al Gore had , with a difference .
In this case , at the end of the bypass operation , you &apos;re going to see the stem cells from the patient that were removed at the beginning of the procedure being injected directly into the heart of the patient .
And I &apos;m standing up here because at one point I &apos;m going to show you just how early this technology is .
Here go the stem cells , right into the beating heart of the patient .
And if you look really carefully , it &apos;s going to be right around this point you &apos;ll actually see a back-flush .
You see the cells coming back out .
We need all sorts of new technology , new devices , to get the cells to the right place at the right time .
Just a little bit of data , a tiny bit of data .
This was a randomized trial .
At this time this was an N of 20 . Now there &apos;s an N of about 100 .
Basically , if you take an extremely sick patient and you give them a bypass , they get a little bit better .
If you give them stem cells as well as their bypass , for these particular patients , they became asymptomatic .
These are now two years out .
The coolest thing would be is if you could diagnose the disease early , and prevent the onset of the disease to a bad state .
This is the same procedure , but now done minimally invasively , with only three holes in the body where they &apos;re taking the heart and simply injecting stem cells through a laparoscopic procedure .
There go the cells .
We don &apos;t have time to go into all of those details , but basically , that works too .
You can take patients who are less sick , and bring them back to an almost asymptomatic state through that kind of therapy .
Here &apos;s another example of stem-cell therapy that isn &apos;t quite clinical yet , but I think very soon will be .
This is the work of Kacey Marra from Pittsburgh , along with a number of colleagues around the world .
They &apos;ve decided that liposuction fluid , which -- in the United States , we have a lot of liposuction fluid .
It &apos;s a great source of stem cells .
Stem cells are packed in that liposuction fluid .
So you could go in , you could get your tummy-tuck .
Out comes the liposuction fluid , and in this case , the stem cells are isolated and turned into neurons .
All done in the lab .
And I think fairly soon , you will see patients being treated with their own fat-derived , or adipose-derived , stem cells .
I talked before about the use of devices to dramatically change the way we treat disease .
Here &apos;s just one example before I close up .
This is equally tragic .
We have a very abiding and heartbreaking partnership with our colleagues at the Institute for Surgical Research in the US Army , who have to treat the now 11,000 kids that have come back from Iraq .
Many of those patients are very severely burned .
And if there &apos;s anything that &apos;s been learned about burn , it &apos;s that we don &apos;t know how to treat it .
Everything that is done to treat burn -- basically we do a sodding approach .
We make something over here , and then we transplant it onto the site of the wound , and we try and get the two to take .
In this case here , a new , wearable bio-reactor has been designed -- it should be tested clinically later this year at ISR -- by Joerg Gerlach in Pittsburgh .
And that bio-reactor will lay down in the wound bed .
The gun that you see there sprays cells .
That &apos;s going to spray cells over that area .
The reactor will serve to fertilize the environment , deliver other things as well at the same time , and therefore we will seed that lawn , as opposed to try the sodding approach .
It &apos;s a completely different way of doing it .
So my 18 minutes is up .
So let me finish up with some good news , and maybe a little bit of bad news .
The good news is that this is happening today .
It &apos;s very powerful work .
Clearly the images kind of get that across .
It &apos;s incredibly difficult because it &apos;s highly inter-disciplinary .
Almost every field of science engineering and clinical practice is involved in trying to get this to happen .
A number of governments , and a number of regions , have recognized that this is a new way to treat disease .
The Japanese government were perhaps the first , when they decided to invest first 3 billion , later another 2 billion in this field .
It &apos;s no coincidence .
Japan is the oldest country on earth in terms of its average age .
They need this to work or their health system dies .
So they &apos;re putting a lot of strategic investment focused in this area .
The European Union , same thing .
China , the same thing .
China just launched a national tissue-engineering center .
The first year budget was 250 million US dollars .
In the United States we &apos;ve had a somewhat different approach .
Oh , for Al Gore to come and be in the real world as president .
We &apos;ve had a different approach .
And the approach has basically been to just sort of fund things as they come along .
But there &apos;s been no strategic investment to bring all of the necessary things to bear and focus them in a careful way .
And I &apos;m going to finish up with a quote , maybe a little cheap shot , at the director of the NIH , who &apos;s a very charming man .
Myself and Jay Vacanti from Harvard went to visit with him and a number of his directors of his institute just a few months ago , to try and convince him that it was time to take just a little piece of that 27.5 billion dollars that he &apos;s going to get next year and focus it , in a strategic way , to make sure we can accelerate the pace at which these things get to patients .
And at the end of a very testy meeting , what the NIH director said was , &quot; Your vision is larger than our appetite . &quot;
I &apos;d like to close by saying that no one &apos;s going to change our vision , but together we can change his appetite .
Thank you .
Terry Moore : Why is &apos; x &apos; the unknown ?
Why is &apos; x &apos; the symbol for an unknown ? In this short and funny talk , Terry Moore gives the surprising answer .
I have the answer to a question that we &apos;ve all asked .
The question is , Why is it that the letter X represents the unknown ?
Now I know we learned that in math class , but now it &apos;s everywhere in the culture -- The X prize , the X-Files , Project X , TEDx .
Where &apos;d that come from ?
About six years ago I decided that I would learn Arabic , which turns out to be a supremely logical language .
To write a word or a phrase or a sentence in Arabic is like crafting an equation , because every part is extremely precise and carries a lot of information .
That &apos;s one of the reasons so much of what we &apos;ve come to think of as Western science and mathematics and engineering was really worked out in the first few centuries of the Common Era by the Persians and the Arabs and the Turks .
This includes the little system in Arabic called al-jebra .
And al-jebr roughly translates to &quot; the system for reconciling disparate parts . &quot;
Al-jebr finally came into English as algebra .
One example among many .
The Arabic texts containing this mathematical wisdom finally made their way to Europe -- which is to say Spain -- in the 11th and 12th centuries .
And when they arrived there was tremendous interest in translating this wisdom into a European language .
But there were problems .
One problem is there are some sounds in Arabic that just don &apos;t make it through a European voice box without lots of practice .
Trust me on that one .
Also , those very sounds tend not to be represented by the characters that are available in European languages .
Here &apos;s one of the culprits .
This is the letter SHeen , and it makes the sound we think of as SH -- &quot; sh . &quot;
It &apos;s also the very first letter of the word shalan , which means &quot; something &quot; just like the the English word &quot; something &quot; -- some undefined , unknown thing .
Now in Arabic , we can make this definite by adding the definite article &quot; al . &quot;
So this is al-shalan -- the unknown thing .
And this is a word that appears throughout early mathematics , such as this 10th century derivation of proofs .
The problem for the Medieval Spanish scholars who were tasked with translating this material is that the letter SHeen and the word shalan can &apos;t be rendered into Spanish because Spanish doesn &apos;t have that SH , that &quot; sh &quot; sound .
So by convention , they created a rule in which they borrowed the CK sound , &quot; ck &quot; sound , from the classical Greek in the form of the letter Kai .
Later when this material was translated into a common European language , which is to say Latin , they simply replaced the Greek Kai with the Latin X.
And once that happened , once this material was in Latin , it formed the basis for mathematics textbooks for almost 600 years .
But now we have the answer to our question .
Why is it that X is the unknown ?
X is the unknown because you can &apos;t say &quot; sh &quot; in Spanish .
And I thought that was worth sharing .
Mike Biddle : We can recycle plastic
Less than 10 % of plastic trash is recycled -- compared to almost 90 % of metals -- because of the massively complicated problem of finding and sorting the different kinds . Frustrated by this waste , Mike Biddle has developed a cheap and incredibly energy efficient plant that can , and does , recycle any kind of plastic .
I &apos;m a garbage man .
And you might find it interesting that I became a garbage man , because I absolutely hate waste .
I hope , within the next 10 minutes , to change the way you think about a lot of the stuff in your life .
And I &apos;d like to start at the very beginning .
Think back when you were just a kid .
How did look at the stuff in your life ?
Perhaps it was like these toddler rules : It &apos;s my stuff if I saw it first .
The entire pile is my stuff if I &apos;m building something .
The more stuff that &apos;s mine , the better .
And of course , it &apos;s your stuff if it &apos;s broken .
Well after spending about 20 years in the recycling industry , it &apos;s become pretty clear to me that we don &apos;t necessarily leave these toddler rules behind as we develop into adults .
And let me tell you why I have that perspective .
Because each and every day at our recycling plants around the world we handle about one million pounds of people &apos;s discarded stuff .
Now a million pounds a day sounds like a lot of stuff , but it &apos;s a tiny drop of the durable goods that are disposed each and every year around the world -- well less than one percent .
In fact , the United Nations estimates that there &apos;s about 85 billion pounds a year of electronics waste that gets discarded around the world each and every year -- and that &apos;s one of the most rapidly growing parts of our waste stream .
And if you throw in other durable goods like automobiles and so forth , that number well more than doubles .
And of course , the more developed the country , the bigger these mountains .
Now when you see these mountains , most people think of garbage .
We see above-ground mines .
And the reason we see mines is because there &apos;s a lot of valuable raw materials that went into making all of this stuff in the first place .
And it &apos;s becoming increasingly important that we figure out how to extract these raw materials from these extremely complicated waste streams .
Because as we &apos;ve heard all week at TED , the world &apos;s getting to be a smaller place with more people in it who want more and more stuff .
And of course , they want the toys and the tools that many of us take for granted .
And what goes into making those toys and tools that we use every single day ?
It &apos;s mostly many types of plastics and many types of metals .
And the metals , we typically get from ore that we mine in ever widening mines and ever deepening mines around the world .
And the plastics , we get from oil , which we go to more remote locations and drill ever deeper wells to extract .
And these practices have significant economic and environmental implications that we &apos;re already starting to see today .
The good news is we are starting to recover materials from our end-of-life stuff and starting to recycle our end-of-life stuff , particularly in regions of the world like here in Europe that have recycling policies in place that require that this stuff be recycled in a responsible manner .
Most of what &apos;s extracted from our end-of-life stuff , if it makes it to a recycler , are the metals .
To put that in perspective -- and I &apos;m using steel as a proxy here for metals , because it &apos;s the most common metal -- if your stuff makes it to a recycler , probably over 90 percent of the metals are going to be recovered and reused for another purpose .
Plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
In fact , it &apos;s more like five percent .
Most of it &apos;s incinerated or landfilled .
Now most people think that &apos;s because plastics are a throw-away material , have very little value .
But actually , plastics are several times more valuable than steel .
And there &apos;s more plastics produced and consumed around the world on a volume basis every year than steel .
So why is such a plentiful and valuable material not recovered at anywhere near the rate of the less valuable material ?
Well it &apos;s predominantly because metals are very easy to recycle from other materials and from one another .
They have very different densities .
They have different electrical and magnetic properties .
And they even have different colors .
So it &apos;s very easy for either humans or machines to separate these metals from one another and from other materials .
Plastics have overlapping densities over a very narrow range .
They have either identical or very similar electrical and magnetic properties .
And any plastic can be any color , as you probably well know .
So the traditional ways of separating materials just simply don &apos;t work for plastics .
Another consequence of metals being so easy to recycle by humans is that a lot of our stuff from the developed world -- and sadly to say , particularly from the United States , where we don &apos;t have any recycling policies in place like here in Europe -- finds its way to developing countries for low-cost recycling .
People , for as little as a dollar a day , pick through our stuff .
They extract what they can , which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can &apos;t recover , which is , again , mostly the plastics .
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .
And they extract the metals by hand .
Now while this may be the low-economic-cost solution , this is certainly not the low-environmental or human health-and-safety solution .
I call this environmental arbitrage .
And it &apos;s not fair , it &apos;s not safe and it &apos;s not sustainable .
Now because the plastics are so plentiful -- and by the way , those other methods don &apos;t lead to the recovery of plastics , obviously -- but people do try to recover the plastics .
This is just one example .
This is a photo I took standing on the rooftops of one of the largest slums in the world in Mumbai , India .
They store the plastics on the roofs .
They bring them below those roofs into small workshops like these , and people try very hard to separate the plastics , by color , by shape , by feel , by any technique they can .
And sometimes they &apos;ll resort to what &apos;s known as the &quot; burn and sniff &quot; technique where they &apos;ll burn the plastic and smell the fumes to try to determine the type of plastic .
None of these techniques result in any amount of recycling in any significant way .
And by the way , please don &apos;t try this technique at home .
So what are we to do about this space-age material , at least what we used to call a space-aged material , these plastics ?
Well I certainly believe that it &apos;s far too valuable and far too abundant to keep putting back in the ground or certainly send up in smoke .
So about 20 years ago , I literally started in my garage tinkering around , trying to figure out how to separate these very similar materials from each other , and eventually enlisted a lot of my friends , in the mining world actually , and in the plastics world , and we started going around to mining laboratories around the world .
Because after all , we &apos;re doing above-ground mining .
And we eventually broke the code .
This is the last frontier of recycling .
It &apos;s the last major material to be recovered in any significant amount on the Earth .
And we finally figured out how to do it .
And in the process , we started recreating how the plastics industry makes plastics .
The traditional way to make plastics is with oil or petrochemicals .
You breakdown the molecules , you recombine them in very specific ways , to make all the wonderful plastics that we enjoy each and every day .
We said , there &apos;s got to be a more sustainable way to make plastics .
And not just sustainable from an environmental standpoint , sustainable from an economic standpoint as well .
Well a good place to start is with waste .
It certainly doesn &apos;t cost as much as oil , and it &apos;s plentiful , as I hope that you &apos;ve been able to see from the photographs .
And because we &apos;re not breaking down the plastic into molecules and recombining them , we &apos;re using a mining approach to extract the materials .
We have significantly lower capital costs in our plant equipment .
We have enormous energy savings .
I don &apos;t know how many other projects on the planet right now can save 80 to 90 percent of the energy compared to making something the traditional way .
And instead of plopping down several hundred million dollars to build a chemical plant that will only make one type of plastic for its entire life , our plants can make any type of plastic we feed them .
And we make a drop-in replacement for that plastic that &apos;s made from petrochemicals .
Our customers get to enjoy huge CO2 savings .
They get to close the loop with their products .
And they get to make more sustainable products .
In the short time period I have , I want to show you a little bit of a sense about how we do this .
It starts with metal recyclers who shred our stuff into very small bits .
They recover the metals and leave behind what &apos;s called shredder residue -- it &apos;s their waste -- a very complex mixture of materials , but predominantly plastics .
We take out the things that aren &apos;t plastics , such as the metals they missed , carpeting , foam , rubber , wood , glass , paper , you name it .
Even an occasional dead animal , unfortunately .
And it goes in the first part of our process here , which is more like traditional recycling .
We &apos;re sieving the material , we &apos;re using magnets , we &apos;re using air classification .
It looks like the Willy Wonka factory at this point .
At the end of this process , we have a mixed plastic composite : many different types of plastics and many different grades of plastics .
This goes into the more sophisticated part of our process , and the really hard work , multi-step separation process begins .
We grind the plastic down to about the size of your small fingernail .
We use a very highly automated process to sort those plastics , not only by type , but by grade .
And out the end of that part of the process come little flakes of plastic : one type , one grade .
We then use optical sorting to color sort this material .
We blend it in 50,000-lb. blending silos .
We push that material to extruders where we melt it , push it through small die holes , make spaghetti-like plastic strands .
And we chop those strands into what are called pellets .
And this becomes the currency of the plastics industry .
This is the same material that you would get from oil .
And today , we &apos;re producing it from your old stuff , and it &apos;s going right back into your new stuff .
So now , instead of your stuff ending up on a hillside in a developing country or literally going up in smoke , you can find your old stuff back on top of your desk in new products , in your office , or back at work in your home .
And these are just a few examples of companies that are buying our plastic , replacing virgin plastic , to make their new products .
So I hope I &apos;ve changed the way you look at at least some of the stuff in your life .
We took our clues from mother nature .
Mother nature wastes very little , reuses practically everything .
And I hope that you stop looking at yourself as a consumer -- that &apos;s a label I &apos;ve always hated my entire life -- and think of yourself as just using resources in one form , until they can be transformed to another form for another use later in time .
And finally , I hope you agree with me to change that last toddler rule just a little bit to : &quot; If it &apos;s broken , it &apos;s my stuff . &quot;
Thank you for your time .
Lalitesh Katragadda : Making maps to fight disaster , build economies
As of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped . This slows the delivery of aid after a disaster -- and hides the economic potential of unused lands and unknown roads . In this short talk , Google &apos;s Lalitesh Katragadda demos Map Maker , a group map-making tool that people around the globe are using to map their world .
In 2008 , Cyclone Nargis devastated Myanmar .
Millions of people were in severe need of help .
The U.N. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area .
But there were no maps , no maps of roads , no maps showing hospitals , no way for help to reach the cyclone victims .
When we look at a map of Los Angeles or London , it is hard to believe that as of 2005 , only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail .
The U.N. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world &apos;s populous faces : not having detailed maps .
But help was coming .
At Google , 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads , 3,000 hospitals , logistics and relief points .
And it took them four days .
The new software they used ? Google Mapmaker .
Google Mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally .
People have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers , from schools to local businesses , and video stores to the corner store .
Maps matter .
Nobel Prize nominee Hernando De Soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land .
For example , a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in India alone .
In the last year alone , thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information , and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable .
And this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere .
Let &apos;s look at some of the maps being created by users right now .
So , as we speak , people are mapping the world in these 170 countries .
You can see Bridget in Africa who just mapped a road in Senegal .
And , closer to home , Chalua , an N.G. road in Bangalore .
This is the result of computational geometry , gesture recognition , and machine learning .
This is a victory of thousands of users , in hundreds of cities , one user , one edit at a time .
This is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet .
Welcome to the new world .
Nathan Myhrvold : Cooking as never seen before
Cookbook author Nathan Myhrvold talks about his magisterial work , &quot; Modernist Cuisine &quot; -- and shares the secret of its cool photographic illustrations , which show cross-sections of food in the very act of being cooked .
So I &apos;m going to tell you a little bit about reimagining food .
I &apos;ve been interested in food for a long time .
I taught myself to cook with a bunch of big books like this .
I went to chef school in France .
And there is a way the world both envisions food , the way the world writes about food and learns about food .
And it &apos;s largely what you would find in these books .
And it &apos;s a wonderful thing .
But there &apos;s some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established .
In the last 20 years , people have realized that science has a tremendous amount to do with food .
In fact , understanding why cooking works requires knowing the science of cooking -- some of the chemistry , some of the physics and so forth .
But that &apos;s not in any of those books .
There &apos;s also a tremendous number of techniques that chefs have developed , some about new aesthetics , new approaches to food .
There &apos;s a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria .
He &apos;s developed a very avant-garde cuisine .
A guy in England called Heston Blumenthal , he &apos;s developed his avant-garde cuisine .
None of the techniques that these people have developed over the course of the last 20 years is in any of those books .
None of them are taught in cooking schools .
In order to learn them , you have to go work in those restaurants .
And finally , there &apos;s the old way of viewing food is the old way .
And so a few years ago -- fours years ago , actually -- I set out to say , is there a way we can communicate science and technique and wonder ?
Is there a way we can show people food in a way they have not seen it before ?
So we tried , and I &apos;ll show you what we came up with .
This is a picture called a cutaway .
This is actually the first picture I took in the book .
The idea here is to explain what happens when you steam broccoli .
And this magic view allows you to see all of what &apos;s happening while the broccoli steams .
Then each of the different little pieces around it explain some fact .
And the hope was two-fold .
One is you can actually explain what happens when you steam broccoli .
But the other thing is that maybe we could seduce people into stuff that was a little more technical , maybe a little bit more scientific , maybe a little bit more chef-y than they otherwise would have .
Because with that beautiful photo , maybe I can also package this little box here that talks about how steaming and boiling actually take different amounts of time .
Steaming ought to be faster .
It turns out it isn &apos;t because of something called film condensation , and this explains that .
Well , that first cutaway picture worked , so we said , &quot; Okay , let &apos;s do some more . &quot;
So here &apos;s another one .
We discovered why woks are the shape they are .
This shaped wok doesn &apos;t work very well ; this caught fire three times .
But we had a philosophy , which is it only has to look good for a thousandth of a second .
And one of our canning cutaways .
Once you start cutting things in half , you kind of get carried away , so you see we cut the jars in half as well as the pan .
And each of these text blocks explains a key thing that &apos;s going on .
In this case , boiling water canning is for canning things that are already pretty acidic .
You don &apos;t have to heat them up as hot as you would something you do pressure canning because bacterial spores can &apos;t grow in the acid .
So this is great for pickled vegetables , which is what we &apos;re canning here .
Here &apos;s our hamburger cutaway .
One of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish .
So you can lavish all the same care , all the same technique , on a hamburger as you would on some much more fancy dish .
And if you do lavish as much technique as possible , and you try to make the highest quality hamburger , it gets to be a little bit involved .
The New York Times ran a piece after my book was delayed and it was called &quot; The Wait for the 30-Hour Hamburger Just Got Longer . &quot;
Because our hamburger recipe , our ultimate hamburger recipe , if you make the buns and you marinate the meat and you do all this stuff , it does take about 30 hours .
Of course , you &apos;re not actually working the whole time .
Most of the time is kind of sitting there .
The point of this cutaway is to show people a view of hamburgers they haven &apos;t seen before and to explain the physics of hamburgers and the chemistry of hamburgers , because , believe it or not , there is something to the physics and chemistry -- in particular , those flames underneath the burger .
Most of the characteristic char-grilled taste doesn &apos;t come from the wood or the charcoal .
Buying mesquite charcoal will not actually make that much difference .
Mostly it comes from fat pyrolyzing , or burning .
So it &apos;s the fat that drips down and flares up that causes the characteristic taste .
Now you might wonder , how do we make these cutaways ?
Most people assume we use Photoshop .
And the answer is : no , not really ; we use a machine shop .
And it turns out , the best way to cut things in half is to actually cut them in half .
So we have two halves of one of the best kitchens in the world .
We cut a $ 5,000 restaurant oven in half .
The manufacturer said , &quot; What would it take for you to cut one in half ? &quot;
I said , &quot; It would have to show up free . &quot;
And so it showed up , we used it a little while , we cut it in half .
Now you can also see a little bit how we did some of these shots .
We would glue a piece of Pyrex or heat-resistant glass in front .
We used a red , very high-temperature silicon to do that .
The great thing is , when you cut something in half , you have another half .
So you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges .
So it &apos;s very much like in a Hollywood movie where a guy flies through the air , supported by wires , and then they take the wires away digitally so you &apos;re flying through the air .
In most cases , though , there was no glass .
Like for the hamburger , we just cut the damn barbecue .
And so those coals that kept falling off the edge , we kept having to put them back up .
But again , it only has to work for a thousandth of a second .
The wok shot caught fire three times .
What happens when you have your wok cut in half is the oil goes down into the fire and whoosh !
One of our cooks lost his eyebrows that way .
But hey , they grow back .
In addition to cutaways , we also explain physics .
This is Fourier &apos;s law of heat conduction .
It &apos;s a partial differential equation .
We have the only cookbook in the world that has partial differential equations in it .
But to make them palatable , we cut it out of a steel plate and put it in front of a fire and photographed it like this .
We &apos;ve got lots of little tidbits in the book .
Everybody knows that your various appliances have wattage , right ?
But you probably don &apos;t know that much about James Watt .
But now you will ; we put a biography of James Watt in .
It &apos;s a little couple paragraphs to explain why we call that unit of heat the watt , and where he got his inspiration .
It turned out he was hired by a Scottish distillery to understand why they were burning so damn much peat to distill the whiskey .
We also did a lot of calculation .
I personally wrote thousands of lines of code to write this cookbook .
Here &apos;s a calculation that shows how the intensity of a barbecue , or other radiant heat source , goes as you move away from it .
So as you move vertically away from this surface , the heat falls off .
As you move side to side , it moves off .
That horn-shaped region is what we call the sweet spot .
That &apos;s the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent .
So that &apos;s the place where you really want to cook .
And it &apos;s got this funny horn-shaped thing , which as far as I know , again , the first cookbook to ever do this .
Now it may also be the last cookbook that ever does it .
You know , there &apos;s two ways you can make a product .
You can do lots of market research and do focus groups and figure out what people really want , or you can just kind of go for it and make the book you want and hope other people like it .
Here &apos;s a step-by-step that shows grinding hamburger .
If you really want great hamburger , it turns out it makes a difference if you align the grain .
And it &apos;s really simple , as you can see here .
As it comes out of the grinder , you just have a little tray , and you just take it off in little passes , build it up , slice it vertically .
Here &apos;s the final hamburger .
This is the 30-hour hamburger .
We make every aspect of this burger .
The lettuce has got liquid smoke infused into it .
We also have things about how to make the bun .
There &apos;s a mushroom , ketchup -- it goes on and on .
Now watch closely . This is popcorn . I &apos;ll explain it here .
The popcorn is illustrating a key thing in physics .
Isn &apos;t that beautiful ?
We have a very high-speed camera , which we had lots of fun with on the book .
The key physics principle here is when water boils to steam it expands by a factor of 1,600 .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that popcorn .
So it &apos;s a great illustration of that .
Now I &apos;m going to close with a video that is kind of unusual .
We have a chapter on gels .
And because people watch Mythbusters and CSI , I thought , well , let &apos;s put in a recipe for a ballistics gelatin .
Well , if you have a high-speed camera , and you have a block of ballistics gelatin lying around , pretty soon somebody does this .
Now the amazing thing here is that a ballistics gelatin is supposed to mimic what happens to human flesh when you get shot -- that &apos;s why you shouldn &apos;t get shot .
The other amazing thing is , when this ballistics gelatin comes down , it falls back down as a nice block .
Anyway , here &apos;s the book .
Here it is .
2,438 pages .
And they &apos;re nice big pages too .
A friend of mine complained that this was too big and too pretty to go in the kitchen , so there &apos;s a sixth volume that has washable , waterproof paper .
Brian Greene : Is our universe the only universe ?
Is there more than one universe ? In this visually rich , action-packed talk , Brian Greene shows how the unanswered questions of physics have led to the theory that our own universe is just one of many in the &quot; multiverse . &quot;
A few months ago the Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to two teams of astronomers for a discovery that has been hailed as one of the most important astronomical observations ever .
And today , after briefly describing what they found , I &apos;m going to tell you about a highly controversial framework for explaining their discovery , namely the possibility that way beyond the Earth , the Milky Way and other distant galaxies , we may find that our universe is not the only universe , but is instead part of a vast complex of universes that we call the multiverse .
Now the idea of a multiverse is a strange one .
I mean , most of us were raised to believe that the word &quot; universe &quot; means everything .
And I say most of us with forethought , as my four-year-old daughter has heard me speak of these ideas since she was born .
And last year I was holding her and I said , &quot; Sophia , I love you more than anything in the universe . &quot;
And she turned to me and said , &quot; Daddy , universe or multiverse ? &quot;
But barring such an anomalous upbringing , it is strange to imagine other realms separate from ours , most with fundamentally different features , that would rightly be called universes of their own .
And yet , speculative though the idea surely is , I aim to convince you that there &apos;s reason for taking it seriously , as it just might be right .
I &apos;m going to tell the story of the multiverse in three parts .
In part one , I &apos;m going to describe those Nobel Prize-winning results and to highlight a profound mystery which those results revealed .
In part two , I &apos;ll offer a solution to that mystery .
It &apos;s based on an approach called string theory , and that &apos;s where the idea of the multiverse will come into the story .
Finally , in part three , I &apos;m going to describe a cosmological theory called inflation , which will pull all the pieces of the story together .
Okay , part one starts back in 1929 when the great astronomer Edwin Hubble realized that the distant galaxies were all rushing away from us , establishing that space itself is stretching , it &apos;s expanding .
Now this was revolutionary .
The prevailing wisdom was that on the largest of scales the universe was static .
But even so , there was one thing that everyone was certain of : The expansion must be slowing down .
That , much as the gravitational pull of the Earth slows the ascent of an apple tossed upward , the gravitational pull of each galaxy on every other must be slowing the expansion of space .
Now let &apos;s fast-forward to the 1990s when those two teams of astronomers I mentioned at the outset were inspired by this reasoning to measure the rate at which the expansion has been slowing .
And they did this by painstaking observations of numerous distant galaxies , allowing them to chart how the expansion rate has changed over time .
Here &apos;s the surprise : They found that the expansion is not slowing down .
Instead they found that it &apos;s speeding up , going faster and faster .
That &apos;s like tossing an apple upward and it goes up faster and faster .
Now if you saw an apple do that , you &apos;d want to know why .
What &apos;s pushing on it ?
Similarly , the astronomers &apos; results are surely well-deserving of the Nobel Prize , but they raised an analogous question .
What force is driving all galaxies to rush away from every other at an ever-quickening speed ?
Well the most promising answer comes from an old idea of Einstein &apos;s .
You see , we are all used to gravity being a force that does one thing , pulls objects together .
But in Einstein &apos;s theory of gravity , his general theory of relativity , gravity can also push things apart .
How ? Well according to Einstein &apos;s math , if space is uniformly filled with an invisible energy , sort of like a uniform , invisible mist , then the gravity generated by that mist would be repulsive , repulsive gravity , which is just what we need to explain the observations .
Because the repulsive gravity of an invisible energy in space -- we now call it dark energy , but I &apos;ve made it smokey white here so you can see it -- its repulsive gravity would cause each galaxy to push against every other , driving expansion to speed up , not slow down .
And this explanation represents great progress .
But I promised you a mystery here in part one .
Here it is .
When the astronomers worked out how much of this dark energy must be infusing space to account for the cosmic speed up , look at what they found .
This number is small .
Expressed in the relevant unit , it is spectacularly small .
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
We want this number to emerge from the laws of physics , but so far no one has found a way to do that .
Now you might wonder , should you care ?
Maybe explaining this number is just a technical issue , a technical detail of interest to experts , but of no relevance to anybody else .
Well it surely is a technical detail , but some details really matter .
Some details provide windows into uncharted realms of reality , and this peculiar number may be doing just that , as the only approach that &apos;s so far made headway to explain it invokes the possibility of other universes -- an idea that naturally emerges from string theory , which takes me to part two : string theory .
So hold the mystery of the dark energy in the back of your mind as I now go on to tell you three key things about string theory .
First off , what is it ?
Well it &apos;s an approach to realize Einstein &apos;s dream of a unified theory of physics , a single overarching framework that would be able to describe all the forces at work in the universe .
And the central idea of string theory is quite straightforward .
It says that if you examine any piece of matter ever more finely , at first you &apos;ll find molecules and then you &apos;ll find atoms and subatomic particles .
But the theory says that if you could probe smaller , much smaller than we can with existing technology , you &apos;d find something else inside these particles -- a little tiny vibrating filament of energy , a little tiny vibrating string .
And just like the strings on a violin , they can vibrate in different patterns producing different musical notes .
These little fundamental strings , when they vibrate in different patterns , they produce different kinds of particles -- so electrons , quarks , neutrinos , photons , all other particles would be united into a single framework , as they would all arise from vibrating strings .
It &apos;s a compelling picture , a kind of cosmic symphony , where all the richness that we see in the world around us emerges from the music that these little , tiny strings can play .
But there &apos;s a cost to this elegant unification , because years of research have shown that the math of string theory doesn &apos;t quite work .
It has internal inconsistencies , unless we allow for something wholly unfamiliar -- extra dimensions of space .
That is , we all know about the usual three dimensions of space .
And you can think about those as height , width and depth .
But string theory says that , on fantastically small scales , there are additional dimensions crumpled to a tiny size so small that we have not detected them .
But even though the dimensions are hidden , they would have an impact on things that we can observe because the shape of the extra dimensions constrains how the strings can vibrate .
And in string theory , vibration determines everything .
So particle masses , the strengths of forces , and most importantly , the amount of dark energy would be determined by the shape of the extra dimensions .
So if we knew the shape of the extra dimensions , we should be able to calculate these features , calculate the amount of dark energy .
The challenge is we don &apos;t know the shape of the extra dimensions .
All we have is a list of candidate shapes allowed by the math .
Now when these ideas were first developed , there were only about five different candidate shapes , so you can imagine analyzing them one-by-one to determine if any yield the physical features we observe .
But over time the list grew as researchers found other candidate shapes .
From five , the number grew into the hundreds and then the thousands -- A large , but still manageable , collection to analyze , since after all , graduate students need something to do .
But then the list continued to grow into the millions and the billions , until today .
The list of candidate shapes has soared to about 10 to the 500 .
So , what to do ?
Well some researchers lost heart , concluding that was so many candidate shapes for the extra dimensions , each giving rise to different physical features , string theory would never make definitive , testable predictions .
But others turned this issue on its head , taking us to the possibility of a multiverse .
Here &apos;s the idea .
Maybe each of these shapes is on an equal footing with every other .
Each is as real as every other , in the sense that there are many universes , each with a different shape , for the extra dimensions .
And this radical proposal has a profound impact on this mystery : the amount of dark energy revealed by the Nobel Prize-winning results .
Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different .
Which means that the mystery of explaining the amount of dark energy we &apos;ve now measured would take on a wholly different character .
In this context , the laws of physics can &apos;t explain one number for the dark energy because there isn &apos;t just one number , there are many numbers .
Which means we have been asking the wrong question .
It &apos;s that the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves in a universe with a particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured instead of any of the other possibilities that are out there ?
And that &apos;s a question on which we can make headway .
Because those universes that have much more dark energy than ours , whenever matter tries to clump into galaxies , the repulsive push of the dark energy is so strong that it blows the clump apart and galaxies don &apos;t form .
And in those universes that have much less dark energy , well they collapse back on themselves so quickly that , again , galaxies don &apos;t form .
And without galaxies , there are no stars , no planets and no chance for our form of life to exist in those other universes .
So we find ourselves in a universe with the particular amount of dark energy we &apos;ve measured simply because our universe has conditions hospitable to our form of life .
And that would be that .
Mystery solved , multiverse found .
Now some find this explanation unsatisfying .
We &apos;re used to physics giving us definitive explanations for the features we observe .
But the point is , if the feature you &apos;re observing can and does take on a wide variety of different values across the wider landscape of reality , then thinking one explanation for a particular value is simply misguided .
An early example comes from the great astronomer Johannes Kepler who was obsessed with understanding a different number -- why the Sun is 93 million miles away from the Earth .
And he worked for decades trying to explain this number , but he never succeeded , and we know why .
Kepler was asking the wrong question .
We now know that there are many planets at a wide variety of different distances from their host stars .
So hoping that the laws of physics will explain one particular number , 93 million miles , well that is simply wrongheaded .
Instead the right question to ask is , why do we humans find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance , instead of any of the other possibilities ?
And again , that &apos;s a question we can answer .
Those planets which are much closer to a star like the Sun would be so hot that our form of life wouldn &apos;t exist .
And those planets that are much farther away from the star , well they &apos;re so cold that , again , our form of life would not take hold .
So we find ourselves on a planet at this particular distance simply because it yields conditions vital to our form of life .
And when it comes to planets and their distances , this clearly is the right kind of reasoning .
The point is , when it comes to universes and the dark energy that they contain , it may also be the right kind of reasoning .
One key difference , of course , is we know that there are other planets out there , but so far I &apos;ve only speculated on the possibility that there might be other universes .
So to pull it all together , we need a mechanism that can actually generate other universes .
And that takes me to my final part , part three .
Because such a mechanism has been found by cosmologists trying to understand the Big Bang .
You see , when we speak of the Big Bang , we often have an image of a kind of cosmic explosion that created our universe and set space rushing outward .
But there &apos;s a little secret .
The Big Bang leaves out something pretty important , the Bang .
It tells us how the universe evolved after the Bang , but gives us no insight into what would have powered the Bang itself .
And this gap was finally filled by an enhanced version of the Big Bang theory .
It &apos;s called inflationary cosmology , which identified a particular kind of fuel that would naturally generate an outward rush of space .
The fuel is based on something called a quantum field , but the only detail that matters for us is that this fuel proves to be so efficient that it &apos;s virtually impossible to use it all up , which means in the inflationary theory , the Big Bang giving rise to our universe is likely not a one-time event .
Instead the fuel not only generated our Big Bang , but it would also generate countless other Big Bangs , each giving rise to its own separate universe with our universe becoming but one bubble in a grand cosmic bubble bath of universes .
And now , when we meld this with string theory , here &apos;s the picture we &apos;re led to .
Each of these universes has extra dimensions .
The extra dimensions take on a wide variety of different shapes .
The different shapes yield different physical features .
And we find ourselves in one universe instead of another simply because it &apos;s only in our universe that the physical features , like the amount of dark energy , are right for our form of life to take hold .
And this is the compelling but highly controversial picture of the wider cosmos that cutting-edge observation and theory have now led us to seriously consider .
One big remaining question , of course , is , could we ever confirm the existence of other universes ?
Well let me describe one way that might one day happen .
The inflationary theory already has strong observational support .
Because the theory predicts that the Big Bang would have been so intense that as space rapidly expanded , tiny quantum jitters from the micro world would have been stretched out to the macro world , yielding a distinctive fingerprint , a pattern of slightly hotter spots and slightly colder spots , across space , which powerful telescopes have now observed .
Going further , if there are other universes , the theory predicts that every so often those universes can collide .
And if our universe got hit by another , that collision would generate an additional subtle pattern of temperature variations across space that we might one day be able to detect .
And so exotic as this picture is , it may one day be grounded in observations , establishing the existence of other universes .
I &apos;ll conclude with a striking implication of all these ideas for the very far future .
You see , we learned that our universe is not static , that space is expanding , that that expansion is speeding up and that there might be other universes all by carefully examining faint pinpoints of starlight coming to us from distant galaxies .
But because the expansion is speeding up , in the very far future , those galaxies will rush away so far and so fast that we won &apos;t be able to see them -- not because of technological limitations , but because of the laws of physics .
The light those galaxies emit , even traveling at the fastest speed , the speed of light , will not be able to overcome the ever-widening gulf between us .
So astronomers in the far future looking out into deep space will see nothing but an endless stretch of static , inky , black stillness .
And they will conclude that the universe is static and unchanging and populated by a single central oasis of matter that they inhabit -- a picture of the cosmos that we definitively know to be wrong .
Now maybe those future astronomers will have records handed down from an earlier era , like ours , attesting to an expanding cosmos teeming with galaxies .
But would those future astronomers believe such ancient knowledge ?
Or would they believe in the black , static empty universe that their own state-of-the-art observations reveal ?
I suspect the latter .
Which means that we are living through a remarkably privileged era when certain deep truths about the cosmos are still within reach of the human spirit of exploration .
It appears that it may not always be that way .
Because today &apos;s astronomers , by turning powerful telescopes to the sky , have captured a handful of starkly informative photons -- a kind of cosmic telegram billions of years in transit .
and the message echoing across the ages is clear .
Sometimes nature guards her secrets with the unbreakable grip of physical law .
Sometimes the true nature of reality beckons from just beyond the horizon .
Thank you very much .
Brian , thank you .
The range of ideas you &apos;ve just spoken about are dizzying , exhilarating , incredible .
How do you think of where cosmology is now , in a sort of historical side ?
Are we in the middle of something unusual historically in your opinion ?
Well it &apos;s hard to say .
When we learn that astronomers of the far future may not have enough information to figure things out , the natural question is , maybe we &apos;re already in that position and certain deep , critical features of the universe already have escaped our ability to understand because of how cosmology evolves .
So from that perspective , maybe we will always be asking questions and never be able to fully answer them .
On the other hand , we now can understand how old the universe is .
We can understand how to understand the data from the microwave background radiation that was set down 13.72 billion years ago -- and yet , we can do calculations today to predict how it will look and it matches .
Holy cow ! That &apos;s just amazing .
So on the one hand , it &apos;s just incredible where we &apos;ve gotten , but who knows what sort of blocks we may find in the future .
You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
Maybe some of these conversations can continue .
Thank you . Thank you , Brian .
Michael Tilson Thomas : Music and emotion through time
In this epic overview , Michael Tilson Thomas traces the development of classical music through the development of written notation , the record , and the re-mix .
Well when I was asked to do this TEDTalk , I was really chuckled , because , you see , my father &apos;s name was Ted , and much of my life , especially my musical life , is really a talk that I &apos;m still having with him , or the part of me that he continues to be .
Now Ted was a New Yorker , an all-around theater guy , and he was a self-taught illustrator and musician .
He didn &apos;t read a note , and he was profoundly hearing impaired .
Yet , he was my greatest teacher .
Because even through the squeaks of his hearing aids , his understanding of music was profound .
And for him , it wasn &apos;t so much the way the music goes as about what it witnesses and where it can take you .
And he did a painting of this experience , which he called &quot; In the Realm of Music . &quot;
Now Ted entered this realm every day by improvising in a sort of Tin Pan Alley style like this .
But he was tough when it came to music .
He said , &quot; There are only two things that matter in music : what and how .
And the thing about classical music , that what and how , it &apos;s inexhaustible . &quot;
That was his passion for the music .
Both my parents really loved it .
They didn &apos;t know all that much about it , but they gave me the opportunity to discover it together with them .
And I think inspired by that memory , it &apos;s been my desire to try and bring it to as many other people as I can , sort of pass it on through whatever means .
And how people get this music , how it comes into their lives , really fascinates me .
One day in New York , I was on the street and I saw some kids playing baseball between stoops and cars and fire hydrants .
And a tough , slouchy kid got up to bat , and he took a swing and really connected .
And he watched the ball fly for a second , and then he went , &quot; Dah dadaratatatah .
Brah dada dadadadah . &quot;
And he ran around the bases .
And I thought , go figure .
How did this piece of 18th century Austrian aristocratic entertainment turn into the victory crow of this New York kid ?
How was that passed on ? How did he get to hear Mozart ?
Well when it comes to classical music , there &apos;s an awful lot to pass on , much more than Mozart , Beethoven or Tchiakovsky .
Because classical music is an unbroken living tradition that goes back over 1,000 years .
And every one of those years has had something unique and powerful to say to us about what it &apos;s like to be alive .
Now the raw material of it , of course , is just the music of everyday life .
It &apos;s all the anthems and dance crazes and ballads and marches .
But what classical music does is to distill all of these musics down , to condense them to their absolute essence , and from that essence create a new language , a language that speaks very lovingly and unflinchingly about who we really are .
It &apos;s a language that &apos;s still evolving .
Now over the centuries it grew into the big pieces we always think of , like concertos and symphonies , but even the most ambitious masterpiece can have as its central mission to bring you back to a fragile and personal moment -- like this one from the Beethoven Violin Concerto .
It &apos;s so simple , so evocative .
So many emotions seem to be inside of it .
Yet , of course , like all music , it &apos;s essentially not about anything .
It &apos;s just a design of pitches and silence and time .
And the pitches , the notes , as you know , are just vibrations .
They &apos;re locations in the spectrum of sound .
And whether we call them 440 per second , A , or 3,729 , B flat -- trust me , that &apos;s right -- they &apos;re just phenomena .
But the way we react to different combinations of these phenomena is complex and emotional and not totally understood .
And the way we react to them has changed radically over the centuries , as have our preferences for them .
So for example , in the 11th century , people liked pieces that ended like this .
And in the 17th century , it was more like this .
And in the 21st century ...
Now your 21st century ears are quite happy with this last chord , even though a while back it would have puzzled or annoyed you or sent some of you running from the room .
And the reason you like it is because you &apos;ve inherited , whether you knew it or not , centuries-worth of changes in musical theory , practice and fashion .
And in classical music we can follow these changes very , very accurately because of the music &apos;s powerful silent partner , the way it &apos;s been passed on : notation .
Now the impulse to notate , or , more exactly I should say , encode music has been with us for a very long time .
In 200 B.C. , a man named Sekulos wrote this song for his departed wife and inscribed it on her gravestone in the notational system of the Greeks .
And a thousand years later , this impulse to notate took an entirely different form .
And you can see how this happened in these excerpts from the Christmas mass &quot; Puer Natus est nobis , &quot; &quot; For Us is Born . &quot;
In the 10th century , little squiggles were used just to indicate the general shape of the tune .
And in the 12th century , a line was drawn , like a musical horizon line , to better pinpoint the pitch &apos;s location .
And then in the 13th century , more lines and new shapes of notes locked in the concept of the tune exactly , and that led to the kind of notation we have today .
Well notation not only passed the music on , notating and encoding the music changed its priorities entirely , because it enabled the musicians to imagine music on a much vaster scale .
Now inspired moves of improvisation could be recorded , saved , considered , prioritized , made into intricate designs .
And from this moment , classical music became what it most essentially is , a dialogue between the two powerful sides of our nature : instinct and intelligence .
And there began to be a real difference at this point between the art of improvisation and the art of composition .
Now an improviser senses and plays the next cool move , but a composer is considering all possible moves , testing them out , prioritizing them out , until he sees how they can form a powerful and coherent design of ultimate and enduring coolness .
Now some of the greatest composers , like Bach , were combinations of these two things .
Bach was like a great improviser with a mind of a chess master .
Mozart was the same way .
But every musician strikes a different balance between faith and reason , instinct and intelligence .
And every musical era had different priorities of these things , different things to pass on , different &apos; whats &apos; and &apos; hows &apos; .
So in the first eight centuries or so of this tradition the big &apos; what &apos; was to praise God .
And by the 1400s , music was being written that tried to mirror God &apos;s mind as could be seen in the design of the night sky .
The &apos; how &apos; was a style called polyphony , music of many independently moving voices that suggested the way the planets seemed to move in Ptolemy &apos;s geocentric universe .
This was truly the music of the spheres .
This is the kind of music that Leonardo DaVinci would have known .
And perhaps its tremendous intellectual perfection and serenity meant that something new had to happen -- a radical new move , which in 1600 is what did happen .
Singer : Ah , bitter blow !
Ah , wicked , cruel fate !
Ah , baleful stars !
Ah , avaricious heaven !
MTT : This , of course , was the birth of opera , and its development put music on a radical new course .
The what now was not to mirror the mind of God , but to follow the emotion turbulence of man .
And the how was harmony , stacking up the pitches to form chords .
And the chords , it turned out , were capable of representing incredible varieties of emotions .
And the basic chords were the ones we still have with us , the triads , either the major one , which we think is happy , or the minor one , which we perceive as sad .
But what &apos;s the actual difference between these two chords ?
It &apos;s just these two notes in the middle .
It &apos;s either E natural , and 659 vibrations per second , or E flat , at 622 .
So the big difference between human happiness and sadness ?
37 freakin &apos; vibrations .
So you can see in a system like this there was enormous subtle potential of representing human emotions .
And in fact , as man began to understand more his complex and ambivalent nature , harmony grew more complex to reflect it .
Turns out it was capable of expressing emotions beyond the ability of words .
Now with all this possibility , classical music really took off .
It &apos;s the time in which the big forms began to arise .
And the effects of technology began to be felt also , because printing put music , the scores , the codebooks of music , into the hands of performers everywhere .
And new and improved instruments made the age of the virtuoso possible .
This is when those big forms arose -- the symphonies , the sonatas , the concertos .
And in these big architectures of time , composers like Beethoven could share the insights of a lifetime .
A piece like Beethoven &apos;s Fifth basically witnessing how it was possible for him to go from sorrow and anger , over the course of a half an hour , step by exacting step of his route , to the moment when he could make it across to joy .
And it turned out the symphony could be used for more complex issues , like gripping ones of culture , such as nationalism or quest for freedom or the frontiers of sensuality .
But whatever direction the music took , one thing until recently was always the same , and that was when the musicians stopped playing , the music stopped .
Now this moment so fascinates me .
I find it such a profound one .
What happens when the music stops ?
Where does it go ? What &apos;s left ?
What sticks with people in the audience at the end of a performance ?
Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude ?
And how might that change their lives ?
To me this is the intimate , personal side of music .
It &apos;s the passing on part . It &apos;s the &apos; why &apos; part of it .
And to me that &apos;s the most essential of all .
Mostly it &apos;s been a person-to-person thing , a teacher-student , performer-audience thing , and then around 1880 came this new technology that first mechanically then through analogs then digitally created a new and miraculous way of passing things on , albeit an impersonal one .
People could now hear music all the time , even though it wasn &apos;t necessary for them to play an instrument , read music or even go to concerts .
And technology democratized music by making everything available .
It spearheaded a cultural revolution in which artists like Caruso and Bessie Smith were on the same footing .
And technology pushed composers to tremendous extremes , using computers and synthesizers to create works of intellectually impenetrable complexity beyond the means of performers and audiences .
At the same time technology , by taking over the role that notation had always played , shifted the balance within music between instinct and intelligence way over to the instinctive side .
The culture in which we live now is awash with music of improvisation that &apos;s been sliced , diced , layered and , God knows , distributed and sold .
What &apos;s the long-term effect of this on us or on music ?
Nobody knows .
The question remains : What happens when the music stops ?
What sticks with people ?
Now that we have unlimited access to music , what does stick with us ?
Well let me show you a story of what I mean by &quot; really sticking with us . &quot;
I was visiting a cousin of mine in an old age home , and I spied a very shaky old man making his way across the room on a walker .
He came over to a piano that was there , and he balanced himself and began playing something like this .
And he said something like , &quot; Me ... boy ... symphony ... Beethoven . &quot;
And I suddenly got it , and I said , &quot; Friend , by any chance are you trying to play this ? &quot;
And he said , &quot; Yes , yes . I was a little boy .
The symphony : Isaac Stern , the concerto , I heard it . &quot;
And I thought , my God , how much must this music mean to this man that he would get himself out of his bed , across the room to recover the memory of this music that , after everything else in his life is sloughing away , still means so much to him ?
Well , that &apos;s why I take every performance so seriously , why it matters to me so much .
I never know who might be there , who might be absorbing it and what will happen to it in their life .
But now I &apos;m excited that there &apos;s more chance than ever before possible of sharing this music .
That &apos;s what drives my interest in projects like the TV series &quot; Keeping Score &quot; with the San Francisco Symphony that looks at the backstories of music , and working with the young musicians at the New World Symphony on projects that explore the potential of the new performing arts centers for both entertainment and education .
And of course , the New World Symphony led to the YouTube Symphony and projects on the internet that reach out to musicians and audiences all over the world .
And the exciting thing is all this is just a prototype .
There &apos;s just a role here for so many people -- teachers , parents , performers -- to be explorers together .
Sure , the big events attract a lot of attention , but what really matters is what goes on every single day .
We need your perspectives , your curiosity , your voices .
And it excites me now to meet people who are hikers , chefs , code writers , taxi drivers , people I never would have guessed who loved the music and who are passing it on .
You don &apos;t need to worry about knowing anything .
If you &apos;re curious , if you have a capacity for wonder , if you &apos;re alive , you know all that you need to know .
You can start anywhere . Ramble a bit .
Follow traces . Get lost . Be surprised , amused inspired .
All that &apos; what &apos; , all that &apos; how &apos; is out there waiting for you to discover its &apos; why &apos; , to dive in and pass it on .
Thank you .
Boghuma Kabisen Titanji : Ethical riddles in HIV research
It &apos;s an all too common story : after participating in an HIV clinical trial , a woman in sub-Saharan Africa is left without the resources to buy a bus ticket to her health clinic , let alone to afford life-saving antiretrovirals . Boghuma Kabisen Titanji asks an important question : how can researchers looking for a cure make sure they &apos;re not taking advantage of those most affected by the pandemic ?
I &apos;d like to share with you the story of one of my patients called Celine .
Celine is a housewife and lives in a rural district of Cameroon in west Central Africa .
Six years ago , at the time of her HIV diagnosis , she was recruited to participate in the clinical trial which was running in her health district at the time .
When I first met Celine , a little over a year ago , she had gone for 18 months without any antiretroviral therapy , and she was very ill .
She told me that she stopped coming to the clinic when the trial ended because she had no money for the bus fare and was too ill to walk the 35-kilometer distance .
Now during the clinical trial , she &apos;d been given all her antiretroviral drugs free of charge , and her transportation costs had been covered by the research funds .
All of these ended once the trial was completed , leaving Celine with no alternatives .
She was unable to tell me the names of the drugs she &apos;d received during the trial , or even what the trial had been about .
I didn &apos;t bother to ask her what the results of the trial were because it seemed obvious to me that she would have no clue .
Yet what puzzled me most was Celine had given her informed consent to be a part of this trial , yet she clearly did not understand the implications of being a participant or what would happen to her once the trial had been completed .
Now , I have shared this story with you as an example of what can happen to participants in the clinical trial when it is poorly conducted .
Maybe this particular trial yielded exciting results .
Maybe it even got published in a high-profile scientific journal .
Maybe it would inform clinicians around the world on how to improve on the clinical management of HIV patients .
But it would have done so at a price to hundreds of patients who , like Celine , were left to their own devices once the research had been completed .
I do not stand here today to suggest in any way that conducting HIV clinical trials in developing countries is bad .
On the contrary , clinical trials are extremely useful tools , and are much needed to address the burden of disease in developing countries .
However , the inequalities that exist between richer countries and developing countries in terms of funding pose a real risk for exploitation , especially in the context of externally-funded research .
Sadly enough , the fact remains that a lot of the studies that are conducted in developing countries could never be authorized in the richer countries which fund the research .
I &apos;m sure you must be asking yourselves what makes developing countries , especially those in sub-Saharan Africa , so attractive for these HIV clinical trials ?
Well , in order for a clinical trial to generate valid and widely applicable results , they need to be conducted with large numbers of study participants and preferably on a population with a high incidence of new HIV infections .
Sub-Saharan Africa largely fits this description , with 22 million people living with HIV , an estimated 70 percent of the 30 million people who are infected worldwide .
Also , research within the continent is a lot easier to conduct due to widespread poverty , endemic diseases and inadequate health care systems .
A clinical trial that is considered to be potentially beneficial to the population is more likely to be authorized , and in the absence of good health care systems , almost any offer of medical assistance is accepted as better than nothing .
Even more problematic reasons include lower risk of litigation , less rigorous ethical reviews , and populations that are willing to participate in almost any study that hints at a cure .
As funding for HIV research increases in developing countries and ethical review in richer countries become more strict , you can see why this context becomes very , very attractive .
The high prevalence of HIV drives researchers to conduct research that is sometimes scientifically acceptable but on many levels ethically questionable .
How then can we ensure that , in our search for the cure , we do not take an unfair advantage of those who are already most affected by the pandemic ?
I invite you to consider four areas I think we can focus on in order to improve the way in which things are done .
The first of these is informed consent .
Now , in order for a clinical trial to be considered ethically acceptable , participants must be given the relevant information in a way in which they can understand , and must freely consent to participate in the trial .
This is especially important in developing countries , where a lot of participants consent to research because they believe it is the only way in which they can receive medical care or other benefits .
Consent procedures that are used in richer countries are often inappropriate or ineffective in a lot of developing countries .
For example , it is counterintuitive to have an illiterate study participant , like Celine , sign a lengthy consent form that they are unable to read , let alone understand .
Local communities need to be more involved in establishing the criteria for recruiting participants in clinical trials , as well as the incentives for participation .
The information in these trials needs to be given to the potential participants in linguistically and culturally acceptable formats .
The second point I would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial .
Now , this is subject to a lot of debate and controversy .
Should the control group in the clinical trial be given the best current treatment which is available anywhere in the world ?
Or should they be given an alternative standard of care , such as the best current treatment available in the country in which the research is being conducted ?
Is it fair to evaluate a treatment regimen which may not be affordable or accessible to the study participants once the research has been completed ?
Now , in a situation where the best current treatment is inexpensive and simple to deliver , the answer is straightforward .
However , the best current treatment available anywhere in the world is often very difficult to provide in developing countries .
It is important to assess the potential risks and benefits of the standard of care which is to be provided to participants in any clinical trial , and establish one which is relevant for the context of the study and most beneficial for the participants within the study .
That brings us to the third point I want you think about : the ethical review of research .
An effective system for reviewing the ethical suitability of clinical trials is primordial to safeguard participants within any clinical trial .
Unfortunately , this is often lacking or inefficient in a lot of developing countries .
Local governments need to set up effective systems for reviewing the ethical issues around the clinical trials which are authorized in different developing countries , and they need to do this by setting up ethical review committees that are independent of the government and research sponsors .
Public accountability needs to be promoted through transparency and independent review by nongovernmental and international organizations as appropriate .
The final point I would like for you to consider tonight is what happens to participants in the clinical trial once the research has been completed .
I think it is absolutely wrong for research to begin in the first place without a clear plan for what would happen to the participants once the trial has ended .
Now , researchers need to make every effort to ensure that an intervention that has been shown to be beneficial during a clinical trial is accessible to the participants of the trial once the trial has been completed .
In addition , they should be able to consider the possibility of introducing and maintaining effective treatments in the wider community once the trial ends .
If , for any reason , they feel that this might not be possible , then I think they should have to ethically justify why the clinical trial should be conducted in the first place .
Now , fortunately for Celine , our meeting did not end in my office .
I was able to get her enrolled into a free HIV treatment program closer to her home , and with a support group to help her cope .
Her story has a positive ending , but there are thousands of others in similar situations who are much less fortunate .
Although she may not know this , my encounter with Celine has completely changed the way in which I view HIV clinical trials in developing countries , and made me even more determined to be part of the movement to change the way in which things are done .
I believe that every single person listening to me tonight can be part of that change .
If you are a researcher , I hold you to a higher standard of moral conscience , to remain ethical in your research , and not compromise human welfare in your search for answers .
If you work for a funding agency or pharmaceutical company , I challenge you to hold your employers to fund research that is ethically sound .
If you come from a developing country like myself , I urge you to hold your government to a more thorough review of the clinical trials which are authorized in your country .
Yes , there is a need for us to find a cure for HIV , to find an effective vaccine for malaria , to find a diagnostic tool that works for T.B. , but I believe that we owe it to those who willingly and selflessly consent to participate in these clinical trials to do this in a humane way .
Thank you .
Jared Diamond : How societies can grow old better
There &apos;s an irony behind the latest efforts to extend human life : It &apos;s no picnic to be an old person in a youth-oriented society . Older people can become isolated , lacking meaningful work and low on funds . In this intriguing talk , Jared Diamond looks at how many different societies treat their elders -- some better , some worse -- and suggests we all take advantage of experience .
To give me an idea of how many of you here may find what I &apos;m about to tell you of practical value , let me ask you please to raise your hands : Who here is either over 65 years old or hopes to live past age 65 or has parents or grandparents who did live or have lived past 65 , raise your hands please .
Okay . You are the people to whom my talk will be of practical value .
The rest of you won &apos;t find my talk personally relevant , but I think that you will still find the subject fascinating .
I &apos;m going to talk about growing older in traditional societies .
This subject constitutes just one chapter of my latest book , which compares traditional , small , tribal societies with our large , modern societies , with respect to many topics such as bringing up children , growing older , health , dealing with danger , settling disputes , religion and speaking more than one language .
Those tribal societies , which constituted all human societies for most of human history , are far more diverse than are our modern , recent , big societies .
All big societies that have governments , and where most people are strangers to each other , are inevitably similar to each other and different from tribal societies .
Tribes constitute thousands of natural experiments in how to run a human society .
They constitute experiments from which we ourselves may be able to learn .
Tribal societies shouldn &apos;t be scorned as primitive and miserable , but also they shouldn &apos;t be romanticized as happy and peaceful .
When we learn of tribal practices , some of them will horrify us , but there are other tribal practices which , when we hear about them , we may admire and envy and wonder whether we could adopt those practices ourselves .
Most old people in the U.S. end up living separately from their children and from most of their friends of their earlier years , and often they live in separate retirements homes for the elderly , whereas in traditional societies , older people instead live out their lives among their children , their other relatives , and their lifelong friends .
Nevertheless , the treatment of the elderly varies enormously among traditional societies , from much worse to much better than in our modern societies .
At the worst extreme , many traditional societies get rid of their elderly in one of four increasingly direct ways : by neglecting their elderly and not feeding or cleaning them until they die , or by abandoning them when the group moves , or by encouraging older people to commit suicide , or by killing older people .
In which tribal societies do children abandon or kill their parents ?
It happens mainly under two conditions .
One is in nomadic , hunter-gather societies that often shift camp and that are physically incapable of transporting old people who can &apos;t walk when the able-bodied younger people already have to carry their young children and all their physical possessions .
The other condition is in societies living in marginal or fluctuating environments , such as the Arctic or deserts , where there are periodic food shortages , and occasionally there just isn &apos;t enough food to keep everyone alive .
Whatever food is available has to be reserved for able-bodied adults and for children .
To us Americans , it sounds horrible to think of abandoning or killing your own sick wife or husband or elderly mother or father , but what could those traditional societies do differently ?
They face a cruel situation of no choice .
Their old people had to do it to their own parents , and the old people know what now is going to happen to them .
At the opposite extreme in treatment of the elderly , the happy extreme , are the New Guinea farming societies where I &apos;ve been doing my fieldwork for the past 50 years , and most other sedentary traditional societies around the world .
In those societies , older people are cared for .
They are fed . They remain valuable .
And they continue to live in the same hut or else in a nearby hut near their children , relatives and lifelong friends .
There are two main sets of reasons for this variation among societies in their treatment of old people .
The variation depends especially on the usefulness of old people and on the society &apos;s values .
First , as regards usefulness , older people continue to perform useful services .
One use of older people in traditional societies is that they often are still effective at producing food .
Another traditional usefulness of older people is that they are capable of babysitting their grandchildren , thereby freeing up their own adult children , the parents of those grandchildren , to go hunting and gathering food for the grandchildren .
Still another traditional value of older people is in making tools , weapons , baskets , pots and textiles .
In fact , they &apos;re usually the people who are best at it .
Older people usually are the leaders of traditional societies , and the people most knowledgeable about politics , medicine , religion , songs and dances .
Finally , older people in traditional societies have a huge significance that would never occur to us in our modern , literate societies , where our sources of information are books and the Internet .
In contrast , in traditional societies without writing , older people are the repositories of information .
It &apos;s their knowledge that spells the difference between survival and death for their whole society in a time of crisis caused by rare events for which only the oldest people alive have had experience .
Those , then , are the ways in which older people are useful in traditional societies .
Their usefulness varies and contributes to variation in the society &apos;s treatment of the elderly .
The other set of reasons for variation in the treatment of the elderly is the society &apos;s cultural values .
For example , there &apos;s particular emphasis on respect for the elderly in East Asia , associated with Confucius &apos; doctrine of filial piety , which means obedience , respect and support for elderly parents .
Cultural values that emphasize respect for older people contrast with the low status of the elderly in the U.S.
Older Americans are at a big disadvantage in job applications .
They &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .
Our hospitals have an explicit policy called age-based allocation of healthcare resources .
That sinister expression means that if hospital resources are limited , for example if only one donor heart becomes available for transplant , or if a surgeon has time to operate on only a certain number of patients , American hospitals have an explicit policy of giving preference to younger patients over older patients on the grounds that younger patients are considered more valuable to society because they have more years of life ahead of them , even though the younger patients have fewer years of valuable life experience behind them .
There are several reasons for this low status of the elderly in the U.S.
One is our Protestant work ethic which places high value on work , so older people who are no longer working aren &apos;t respected .
Another reason is our American emphasis on the virtues of self-reliance and independence , so we instinctively look down on older people who are no longer self-reliant and independent .
Still a third reason is our American cult of youth , which shows up even in our advertisements .
Ads for Coca-Cola and beer always depict smiling young people , even though old as well as young people buy and drink Coca-Cola and beer .
Just think , what &apos;s the last time you saw a Coke or beer ad depicting smiling people 85 years old ? Never .
Instead , the only American ads featuring white-haired old people are ads for retirement homes and pension planning .
Well , what has changed in the status of the elderly today compared to their status in traditional societies ?
There have been a few changes for the better and more changes for the worse .
Big changes for the better include the fact that today we enjoy much longer lives , much better health in our old age , and much better recreational opportunities .
Another change for the better is that we now have specialized retirement facilities and programs to take care of old people .
Changes for the worse begin with the cruel reality that we now have more old people and fewer young people than at any time in the past .
That means that all those old people are more of a burden on the few young people , and that each old person has less individual value .
Another big change for the worse in the status of the elderly is the breaking of social ties with age , because older people , their children , and their friends , all move and scatter independently of each other many times during their lives .
We Americans move on the average every five years .
Hence our older people are likely to end up living distant from their children and the friends of their youth .
Yet another change for the worse in the status of the elderly is formal retirement from the workforce , carrying with it a loss of work friendships and a loss of the self-esteem associated with work .
Perhaps the biggest change for the worse is that our elderly are objectively less useful than in traditional societies .
Widespread literacy means that they are no longer useful as repositories of knowledge .
When we want some information , we look it up in a book or we Google it instead of finding some old person to ask .
The slow pace of technological change in traditional societies means that what someone learns there as a child is still useful when that person is old , but the rapid pace of technological change today means that what we learn as children is no longer useful 60 years later .
And conversely , we older people are not fluent in the technologies essential for surviving in modern society .
For example , as a 15-year-old , I was considered outstandingly good at multiplying numbers because I had memorized the multiplication tables and I know how to use logarithms and I &apos;m quick at manipulating a slide rule .
Today , though , those skills are utterly useless because any idiot can now multiply eight-digit numbers accurately and instantly with a pocket calculator .
Conversely , I at age 75 am incompetent at skills essential for everyday life .
My family &apos;s first TV set in 1948 had only three knobs that I quickly mastered : an on-off switch , a volume knob , and a channel selector knob .
Today , just to watch a program on the TV set in my own house , I have to operate a 41-button TV remote that utterly defeats me .
I have to telephone my 25-year-old sons and ask them to talk me through it while I try to push those wretched 41 buttons .
What can we do to improve the lives of the elderly in the U.S. , and to make better use of their value ?
That &apos;s a huge problem .
In my remaining four minutes today , I can offer just a few suggestions .
One value of older people is that they are increasingly useful as grandparents for offering high-quality childcare to their grandchildren , if they choose to do it , as more young women enter the workforce and as fewer young parents of either gender stay home as full-time caretakers of their children .
Compared to the usual alternatives of paid babysitters and day care centers , grandparents offer superior , motivated , experienced child care .
They &apos;ve already gained experience from raising their own children .
They usually love their grandchildren , and are eager to spend time with them .
Unlike other caregivers , grandparents don &apos;t quit their job because they found another job with higher pay looking after another baby .
A second value of older people is paradoxically related to their loss of value as a result of changing world conditions and technology .
At the same time , older people have gained in value today precisely because of their unique experience of living conditions that have now become rare because of rapid change , but that could come back .
For example , only Americans now in their 70s or older today can remember the experience of living through a great depression , the experience of living through a world war , and agonizing whether or not dropping atomic bombs would be more horrible than the likely consequences of not dropping atomic bombs .
Most of our current voters and politicians have no personal experience of any of those things , but millions of older Americans do .
Unfortunately , all of those terrible situations could come back .
Even if they don &apos;t come back , we have to be able to plan for them on the basis of the experience of what they were like .
Older people have that experience .
Younger people don &apos;t .
The remaining value of older people that I &apos;ll mention involves recognizing that while there are many things that older people can no longer do , there are other things that they can do better than younger people .
A challenge for society is to make use of those things that older people are better at doing .
Some abilities , of course , decrease with age .
Those include abilities at tasks requiring physical strength and stamina , ambition , and the power of novel reasoning in a circumscribed situation , such as figuring out the structure of DNA , best left to scientists under the age of 30 .
Conversely , valuable attributes that increase with age include experience , understanding of people and human relationships , ability to help other people without your own ego getting in the way , and interdisciplinary thinking about large databases , such as economics and comparative history , best left to scholars over the age of 60 .
Hence older people are much better than younger people at supervising , administering , advising , strategizing , teaching , synthesizing , and devising long-term plans .
I &apos;ve seen this value of older people with so many of my friends in their 60s , 70s , 80s and 90s , who are still active as investment managers , farmers , lawyers and doctors .
In short , many traditional societies make better use of their elderly and give their elderly more satisfying lives than we do in modern , big societies .
Paradoxically nowadays , when we have more elderly people than ever before , living healthier lives and with better medical care than ever before , old age is in some respects more miserable than ever before .
The lives of the elderly are widely recognized as constituting a disaster area of modern American society .
We can surely do better by learning from the lives of the elderly in traditional societies .
But what &apos;s true of the lives of the elderly in traditional societies is true of many other features of traditional societies as well .
Of course , I &apos;m not advocating that we all give up agriculture and metal tools and return to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle .
There are many obvious respects in which our lives today are far happier than those in small , traditional societies .
To mention just a few examples , our lives are longer , materially much richer , and less plagued by violence than are the lives of people in traditional societies .
But there are also things to be admired about people in traditional societies , and perhaps to be learned from them .
Their lives are usually socially much richer than our lives , although materially poorer .
Their children are more self-confident , more independent , and more socially skilled than are our children .
They think more realistically about dangers than we do .
They almost never die of diabetes , heart disease , stroke , and the other noncommunicable diseases that will be the causes of death of almost all of us in this room today .
Features of the modern lifestyle predispose us to those diseases , and features of the traditional lifestyle protect us against them .
Those are just some examples of what we can learn from traditional societies .
I hope that you will find it as fascinating to read about traditional societies as I found it to live in those societies .
Thank you .
Jae Rhim Lee : My mushroom burial suit
Here &apos;s a powerful provocation from artist Jae Rhim Lee . Can we commit our bodies to a cleaner , greener Earth , even after death ? Naturally -- using a special burial suit seeded with pollution-gobbling mushrooms . Yes , this just might be the strangest TEDTalk you &apos;ll ever see ...
So I &apos;m here to explain why I &apos;m wearing these ninja pajamas .
And to do that , I &apos;d like to talk first about environmental toxins in our bodies .
So some of you may know about the chemical Bisphenol A , BPA .
It &apos;s a material hardener and synthetic estrogen that &apos;s found in the lining of canned foods and some plastics .
So BPA mimics the body &apos;s own hormones and causes neurological and reproductive problems .
And it &apos;s everywhere .
A recent study found BPA in 93 percent of people six and older .
But it &apos;s just one chemical .
The Center for Disease Control in the U.S.
says we have 219 toxic pollutants in our bodies , and this includes preservatives , pesticides and heavy metals like lead and mercury .
To me , this says three things .
First , don &apos;t become a cannibal .
Second , we are both responsible for and the victims of our own pollution .
And third , our bodies are filters and storehouses for environmental toxins .
So what happens to all these toxins when we die ?
The short answer is : They return to the environment in one way or another , continuing the cycle of toxicity .
But our current funeral practices make the situation much worse .
If you &apos;re cremated , all those toxins I mentioned are released into the atmosphere .
And this includes 5,000 pounds of mercury from our dental fillings alone every year .
And in a traditional American funeral , a dead body is covered with fillers and cosmetics to make it look alive .
It &apos;s then pumped with toxic formaldehyde to slow decomposition -- a practice which causes respiratory problems and cancer in funeral personnel .
So by trying to preserve our dead bodies , we deny death , poison the living and further harm the environment .
Green or natural burials , which don &apos;t use embalming , are a step in the right direction , but they don &apos;t address the existing toxins in our bodies .
I think there &apos;s a better solution .
I &apos;m an artist , so I &apos;d like to offer a modest proposal at the intersection of art , science and culture .
The Infinity Burial Project , an alternative burial system that uses mushrooms to decompose and clean toxins in bodies .
The Infinity Burial Project began a few years ago with a fantasy to create the Infinity Mushroom -- a new hybrid mushroom that would decompose bodies , clean the toxins and deliver nutrients to plant roots , leaving clean compost .
But I learned it &apos;s nearly impossible to create a new hybrid mushroom .
I also learned that some of our tastiest mushrooms can clean environmental toxins in soil .
So I thought maybe I could train an army of toxin-cleaning edible mushrooms to eat my body .
So today , I &apos;m collecting what I shed or slough off -- my hair , skin and nails -- and I &apos;m feeding these to edible mushrooms .
As the mushrooms grow , I pick the best feeders to become Infinity Mushrooms .
It &apos;s a kind of imprinting and selective breeding process for the afterlife .
So when I die , the Infinity Mushrooms will recognize my body and be able to eat it .
All right , so for some of you , this may be really , really out there .
Just a little .
I realize this is not the kind of relationship that we usually aspire to have with our food .
We want to eat , not be eaten by , our food .
But as I watch the mushrooms grow and digest my body , I imagine the Infinity Mushroom as a symbol of a new way of thinking about death and the relationship between my body and the environment .
See for me , cultivating the Infinity Mushroom is more than just scientific experimentation or gardening or raising a pet , it &apos;s a step towards accepting the fact that someday I will die and decay .
It &apos;s also a step towards taking responsibility for my own burden on the planet .
Growing a mushroom is also part of a larger practice of cultivating decomposing organisms called decompiculture , a concept that was developed by an entomologist , Timothy Myles .
The Infinity Mushroom is a subset of decompiculture I &apos;m calling body decompiculture and toxin remediation -- the cultivation of organisms that decompose and clean toxins in bodies .
And now about these ninja pajamas .
Once it &apos;s completed , I plan to integrate the Infinity Mushrooms into a number of objects .
First , a burial suit infused with mushroom spores , the Mushroom Death Suit .
I &apos;m wearing the second prototype of this burial suit .
It &apos;s covered with a crocheted netting that is embedded with mushroom spores .
The dendritic pattern you see mimics the growth of mushroom mycelia , which are the equivalent of plant roots .
I &apos;m also making a decompiculture kit , a cocktail of capsules that contain Infinity Mushroom spores and other elements that speed decomposition and toxin remediation .
These capsules are embedded in a nutrient-rich jelly , a kind of second skin , which dissolves quickly and becomes baby food for the growing mushrooms .
So I plan to finish the mushroom and decompiculture kit in the next year or two , and then I &apos;d like to begin testing them , first with expired meat from the market and then with human subjects .
And believe it or not , a few people have offered to donate their bodies to the project to be eaten by mushrooms .
What I &apos;ve learned from talking to these folks is that we share a common desire to understand and accept death and to minimize the impact of our death on the environment .
I wanted to cultivate this perspective just like the mushrooms , so I formed the Decompiculture Society , a group of people called decompinauts who actively explore their postmortem options , seek death acceptance and cultivate decomposing organisms like the Infinity Mushroom .
The Decompiculture Society shares a vision of a cultural shift , from our current culture of death denial and body preservation to one of decompiculture , a radical acceptance of death and decomposition .
Accepting death means accepting that we are physical beings who are intimately connected to the environment , as the research on environmental toxins confirms .
And the saying goes , we came from dust and will return to dust .
And once we understand that we &apos;re connected to the environment , we see that the survival of our species depends on the survival of the planet .
I believe this is the beginning of true environmental responsibility .
Thank you .
Jonathan Klein : Photos that changed the world
Photographs do more than document history -- they make it . At TED University , Jonathan Klein of Getty Images shows some of the most iconic , and talks about what happens when a generation sees an image so powerful it can &apos;t look away -- or back .
In my industry , we believe that images can change the world .
Okay , we &apos;re naive , we &apos;re bright-eyed and bushy-tailed .
The truth is that we know that the images themselves don &apos;t change the world , but we &apos;re also aware that , since the beginning of photography , images have provoked reactions in people , and those reactions have caused change to happen .
So let &apos;s begin with a group of images .
I &apos;d be extremely surprised if you didn &apos;t recognize many or most of them .
They &apos;re best described as iconic : so iconic , perhaps , they &apos;re cliches .
In fact , they &apos;re so well-known that you might even recognize them in a slightly or somewhat different form .
But I think we &apos;re looking for something more .
We &apos;re looking for something more .
We &apos;re looking for images that shine an uncompromising light on crucial issues , images that transcend borders , that transcend religions , images that provoke us to step up and do something -- in other words , to act .
Well , this image you &apos;ve all seen .
It changed our view of the physical world .
We had never seen our planet from this perspective before .
Many people credit a lot of the birth of the environmental movement to our seeing the planet like this for the first time -- its smallness , its fragility .
Forty years later , this group , more than most , are well aware of the destructive power that our species can wield over our environment .
And at last , we appear to be doing something about it .
This destructive power takes many different forms .
For example , these images taken by Brent Stirton in the Congo .
These gorillas were murdered , some would even say crucified , and unsurprisingly , they sparked international outrage .
Most recently , we &apos;ve been tragically reminded of the destructive power of nature itself with the recent earthquake in Haiti .
Well , I think what is far worse is man &apos;s destructive power over man .
Samuel Pisar , an Auschwitz survivor , said , and I &apos;ll quote him , &quot; The Holocaust teaches us that nature , even in its cruelest moments , is benign in comparison with man , when he loses his moral compass and his reason . &quot;
There &apos;s another kind of crucifixion .
The horrifying images from Abu Ghraib as well as the images from Guantanamo had a profound impact .
The publication of those images , as opposed to the images themselves , caused a government to change its policies .
Some would argue that it is those images that did more to fuel the insurgency in Iraq than virtually any other single act .
Furthermore , those images forever removed the so-called moral high ground of the occupying forces .
Let &apos;s go back a little .
In the 1960s and 1970s , the Vietnam War was basically shown in America &apos;s living rooms day in , day out .
News photos brought people face to face with the victims of the war : a little girl burned by napalm , a student killed by the National Guard at Kent State University in Ohio during a protest .
In fact , these images became the voices of protest themselves .
Now , images have power to shed light of understanding on suspicion , ignorance , and in particular -- I &apos;ve given a lot of talks on this but I &apos;ll just show one image -- the issue of HIV / AIDS .
In the 1980s , the stigmatization of people with the disease was an enormous barrier to even discussing or addressing it .
A simple act , in 1987 , of the most famous woman in the world , the Princess of Wales , touching an HIV / AIDS infected baby did a great deal , especially in Europe , to stop that .
She , better than most , knew the power of an image .
So when we are confronted by a powerful image , we all have a choice : We can look away , or we can address the image .
Thankfully , when these photos appeared in The Guardian in 1998 , they put a lot of focus and attention and , in the end , a lot of money towards the Sudan famine relief efforts .
Did the images change the world ?
No , but they had a major impact .
Images often push us to question our core beliefs and our responsibilities to each other .
We all saw those images after Katrina , and I think for millions of people they had a very strong impact .
And I think it &apos;s very unlikely that they were far from the minds of Americans when they went to vote in November 2008 .
Unfortunately , some very important images are deemed too graphic or disturbing for us to see them .
I &apos;ll show you one photo here , and it &apos;s a photo by Eugene Richards of an Iraq War veteran from an extraordinary piece of work , which has never been published , called War Is Personal .
But images don &apos;t need to be graphic in order to remind us of the tragedy of war .
John Moore set up this photo at Arlington Cemetery .
After all the tense moments of conflict in all the conflict zones of the world , there &apos;s one photograph from a much quieter place that haunts me still , much more than the others .
Ansel Adams said , and I &apos;m going to disagree with him , &quot; You don &apos;t take a photograph , you make it . &quot;
In my view , it &apos;s not the photographer who makes the photo , it &apos;s you .
We bring to each image our own values , our own belief systems , and as a result of that , the image resonates with us .
My company has 70 million images .
I have one image in my office .
Here it is .
I hope that the next time you see an image that sparks something in you , you &apos;ll better understand why , and I know that speaking to this audience , you &apos;ll definitely do something about it .
And thank you to all the photographers .
John Hunter : Teaching with the World Peace Game
John Hunter puts all the problems of the world on a 4&apos;x5 &apos; plywood board -- and lets his 4th-graders solve them . At TED2011 , he explains how his World Peace Game engages schoolkids , and why the complex lessons it teaches -- spontaneous , and always surprising -- go further than classroom lectures can .
I &apos;m very fortunate to be here .
I feel so fortunate .
I &apos;ve been so impressed by the kindness expressed to me .
I called my wife Leslie , and I said , &quot; You know , there &apos;s so many good people trying to do so much good .
It feels like I &apos;ve landed in a colony of angels . &quot;
It &apos;s a true feeling .
But let me get to the talk -- I see the clock is running .
I &apos;m a public school teacher , and I just want to share a story of my superintendent .
Her name is Pam Moran in Albemarle County , Virginia , the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains .
And she &apos;s a very high-tech superintendent .
She uses smart boards , she blogs , she Tweets , she does Facebook , she does all this sort of high-tech stuff .
She &apos;s a technology leader and instructional leader .
But in her office , there &apos;s this old wooden , weather-worn table , kitchen table -- peeling green paint , it &apos;s kind of rickety .
And I said , &quot; Pam , you &apos;re such a modern , cutting-edge person .
Why is this old table in your office ? &quot;
And she told me , she said , &quot; You know , I grew up in Southwestern Virginia , in the coal mines and the farmlands of rural Virginia , and this table was in my grandfather &apos;s kitchen .
And we &apos;d come in from playing , he &apos;d come in from plowing and working , and we &apos;d sit around that table every night .
And as I grew up , I heard so much knowledge and so many insights and so much wisdom come out around this table , I began to call it the wisdom table .
And when he passed on , I took this table with me and brought it to my office , and it reminds me of him .
It reminds me of what goes on around an empty space sometimes . &quot;
The project I &apos;m going to tell you about is called the World Peace Game , and essentially it is also an empty space .
And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
It all started back in 1977 .
I was a young man , and I had been dropping in and out of college .
And my parents were very patient , but I had been doing intermittent sojourns to India on a mystical quest .
And I remember the last time I came back from India -- in my long white flowing robes and my big beard and my John Lennon glasses -- and I said to my father , &quot; Dad , I think I &apos;ve just about found spiritual enlightenment . &quot;
He said , &quot; Well there &apos;s one more thing you need to find . &quot;
I said , &quot; What is that , dad ? &quot; &quot; A job . &quot;
And so they pleaded with me to get a degree in something .
So I got a degree and it turned out to be education .
It was an experimental education program .
It could have been dentistry , but the word &quot; experimental &quot; was in it , and so that &apos;s what I had to go for .
And I went in for a job interview in the Richmond Public Schools in Virginia , the capital city , bought a three-piece suit -- my concession to convention -- kept my long beard and my afro and my platform shoes -- at the time it was the &apos; 70s -- and I walked in , and I sat down and had an interview .
And I guess they were hard up for teachers because the supervisor , her name was Anna Aro , said I had the job teaching gifted children .
And I was so shocked , so stunned , I got up and said , &quot; Well , thank you , but what do I do ? &quot;
Gifted education hadn &apos;t really taken hold too much .
There weren &apos;t really many materials or things to use .
And I said , &quot; What do I do ? &quot;
And her answer shocked me . It stunned me .
Her answer set the template for the entire career I was to have after that .
She said , &quot; What do you want to do ? &quot;
And that question cleared the space .
There was no program directive , no manual to follow , no standards in gifted education in that way .
And she cleared such a space that I endeavored from then on to clear a space for my students , an empty space , whereby they could create and make meaning out of their own understanding .
So this happened in 1978 , and I was teaching many years later , and a friend of mine introduced me to a young filmmaker .
His name is Chris Farina .
Chris Farina is here today at his own cost .
Chris , could you stand up and let them see you -- a young , visionary filmmaker who &apos;s made a film .
This film is called &quot; World Peace and Other 4th Grade Achievements . &quot;
He proposed the film to me -- it &apos;s a great title .
He proposed the film to me , and I said , &quot; Yeah , maybe it &apos;ll be on local TV , and we can say hi to our friends . &quot;
But the film has really gone places .
Now it &apos;s still in debt , but Chris has managed , through his own sacrifice , to get this film out .
So we made a film and it turns out to be more than a story about me , more than a story about one teacher .
It &apos;s a story that &apos;s a testament to teaching and teachers .
And it &apos;s a beautiful thing .
And the strange thing is , when I watch the film -- I have the eerie sensation of seeing it -- I saw myself literally disappear .
What I saw was my teachers coming through me .
I saw my geometry teacher in high school , Mr. Rucell &apos;s wry smile under his handlebar mustache .
That &apos;s the smile I use -- that &apos;s his smile .
I saw Jan Polo &apos;s flashing eyes .
And they weren &apos;t flashing in anger , they were flashing in love , intense love for her students .
And I have that kind of flash sometimes .
And I saw Miss Ethel J. Banks who wore pearls and high-heels to elementary school every day .
And you know , she had that old-school teacher stare .
You know the one .
&quot; And I &apos;m not even talking about you behind me , because I &apos;ve got eyes in the back of my head . &quot;
You know that teacher ?
I didn &apos;t use that stare very often , but I do have it in my repertoire .
And Miss Banks was there as a great mentor for me .
And then I saw my own parents , my first teachers .
My father , very inventive , spatial thinker .
That &apos;s my brother Malcolm there on the right .
And my mother , who taught me in fourth grade in segregated schools in Virginia , who was my inspiration .
And really , I feel as though , when I see the film -- I have a gesture she does , like this -- I feel like I am a continuation of her gesture .
I am one of her teaching gestures .
And the beautiful thing was , I got to teach my daughter in elementary school , Madeline .
And so that gesture of my mother &apos;s continues through many generations .
It &apos;s an amazing feeling to have that lineage .
And so I &apos;m here standing on the shoulders of many people .
I &apos;m not here alone .
There are many people on this stage right now .
And so this World Peace Game I &apos;d like to tell you about .
It started out like this : it &apos;s just a four-foot by five-foot plywood board in an inner-city urban school , 1978 .
I was creating a lesson for students on Africa .
We put all the problems of the world there , and I thought , let &apos;s let them solve it .
I didn &apos;t want to lecture or have just book reading .
I wanted to have them be immersed and learn the feeling of learning through their bodies .
So I thought , well they like to play games .
I &apos;ll make something -- I didn &apos;t say interactive ; we didn &apos;t have that term in 1978 -- but something interactive .
And so we made the game , and it has since evolved to a four-foot by four-foot by four-foot Plexiglass structure .
And it has four Plexiglass layers .
There &apos;s an outer space layer with black holes and satellites and research satellites and asteroid mining .
There &apos;s an air and space level with clouds that are big puffs of cotton we push around and territorial air spaces and air forces , a ground and sea level with thousands of game pieces on it -- even an undersea level with submarines and undersea mining .
There are four countries around the board .
The kids make up the names of the countries -- some are rich ; some are poor .
They have different assets , commercial and military .
And each country has a cabinet .
There &apos;s a Prime Minister , Secretary of State , Minister of Defense and a CFO , or Comptroller .
I choose the Prime Minister based on my relationship with them .
I offer them the job , they can turn it down , and then they choose their own cabinet .
There &apos;s a World Bank , arms dealers and a United Nations .
There &apos;s also a weather goddess who controls a random stock market and random weather .
That &apos;s not all .
And then there &apos;s a 13-page crisis document with 50 interlocking problems .
So that , if one thing changes , everything else changes .
I throw them into this complex matrix , and they trust me because we have a deep , rich relationship together .
And so with all these crises , we have -- let &apos;s see -- ethnic and minority tensions ; we have chemical and nuclear spills , nuclear proliferation .
There &apos;s oil spills , environmental disasters , water rights disputes , breakaway republics , famine , endangered species and global warming .
If Al Gore is here , I &apos;m going to send my fourth-graders from Agnor-Hurt and Venable schools to you because they solved global warming in a week .
And they &apos;ve done it several times too .
So I also have in the game a saboteur -- some child -- it &apos;s basically a troublemaker -- and I have my troublemaker put to use because they , on the surface , are trying to save the world and their position in the game .
But they &apos;re also trying to undermine everything in the game .
And they do it secretly through misinformation and ambiguities and irrelevancies , trying to cause everyone to think more deeply .
The saboteur is there , and we also read from Sun Tzu &apos;s &quot; The Art of War . &quot;
Fourth-graders understand it -- nine years old -- and they handle that and use that to understand how to , not follow -- at first they do -- the paths to power and destruction , the path to war .
They learn to overlook short-sighted reactions and impulsive thinking , to think in a long-term , more consequential way .
Stewart Brand is here , and one of the ideas for this game came from him with a CoEvolution Quarterly article on a peace force .
And in the game , sometimes students actually form a peace force .
I &apos;m just a clock watcher .
I &apos;m just a clarifier . I &apos;m just a facilitator .
The students run the game .
I have no chance to make any policy whatsoever once they start playing .
So I &apos;ll just share with you ...
Boy : The World Peace Game is serious .
You &apos;re actually getting taught something like how to take care of the world .
See , Mr. Hunter is doing that because he says his time has messed up a lot , and he &apos;s trying to tell us how to fix that problem .
John Hunter : I offered them a -- Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
And I admit the truth to them right up front : I don &apos;t know .
And because I don &apos;t know , they &apos;ve got to dig up the answer .
And so I apologize to them as well .
I say , &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , boys and girls , but the truth is we have left this world to you in such a sad and terrible shape , and we hope you can fix it for us , and maybe this game will help you learn how to do it . &quot;
It &apos;s a sincere apology , and they take it very seriously .
Now you may be wondering what all this complexity looks like .
Well when we have the game start , here &apos;s what you see .
JH : All right , we &apos;re going into negotiations as of now . Go .
JH : My question to you is , who &apos;s in charge of that classroom ?
It &apos;s a serious question : who is really in charge ?
I &apos;ve learned to cede control of the classroom over to the students over time .
There &apos;s a trust and an understanding and a dedication to an ideal that I simply don &apos;t have to do what I thought I had to do as a beginning teacher : control every conversation and response in the classroom .
It &apos;s impossible . Their collective wisdom is much greater than mine , and I admit it to them openly .
So I &apos;ll just share with you some stories very quickly of some magical things that have happened .
In this game we had a little girl , and she was the Defense Minister of the poorest nation .
And the Defense Minister -- she had the tank corps and Air Force and so forth .
And she was next door to a very wealthy , oil-rich neighbor .
Without provocation , suddenly she attacked , against her Prime Minister &apos;s orders , the next-door neighbor &apos;s oil fields .
She marched into the oil field reserves , surrounded it , without firing a shot , and secured it and held it .
And that neighbor was unable to conduct any military operations because their fuel supply was locked up .
We were all upset with her , &quot; Why are you doing this ?
This is the World Peace Game . What is wrong with you ? &quot;
This was a little girl and , at nine years old , she held her pieces and said , &quot; I know what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
To her girlfriends she said that .
That &apos;s a breach there .
And we learned in this , you don &apos;t really ever want to cross a nine year-old girl with tanks .
They are the toughest opponents .
And we were very upset .
I thought I was failing as a teacher . Why would she do this ?
But come to find out , a few game days later -- and there are turns where we take negotiation from a team -- actually there &apos;s a negotiation period with all teams , and each team takes a turn , then we go back in negotiation , around and around , so each turn around is one game day .
So a few game days later it came to light that we found out this major country was planning a military offensive to dominate the entire world .
Had they had their fuel supplies , they would have done it .
She was able to see the vectors and trend lines and intentions long before any of us and understand what was going to happen and made a philosophical decision to attack in a peace game .
Now she used a small war to avert a larger war , so we stopped and had a very good philosophical discussion about whether that was right , conditional good , or not right .
That &apos;s the kind of thinking that we put them in , the situations .
I could not have designed that in teaching it .
It came about spontaneously through their collective wisdom .
Another example , a beautiful thing happened .
We have a letter in the game .
If you &apos;re a military commander and you wage troops -- the little plastic toys on the board -- and you lose them , I put in a letter .
You have to write a letter to their parents -- the fictional parents of your fictional troops -- explaining what happened and offering your condolences .
So you have a little bit more thought before you commit to combat .
And so we had this situation come up -- last summer actually , at Agnor-Hurt School in Albemarle County -- and one of our military commanders got up to read that letter and one of the other kids said , &quot; Mr. Hunter , let &apos;s ask -- there &apos;s a parent over there . &quot;
There was a parent visiting that day , just sitting in the back of the room .
&quot; Let &apos;s ask that mom to read the letter .
It &apos;ll be more realer if she reads it . &quot;
So we did , we asked her , and she gamely picked up the letter .
&quot; Sure . &quot; She started reading . She read one sentence .
She read two sentences .
By the third sentence , she was in tears .
I was in tears .
Everybody understood that when we lose somebody , the winners are not gloating .
We all lose .
And it was an amazing occurrence and an amazing understanding .
I &apos;ll show you what my friend David says about this .
He &apos;s been in many battles .
David : We &apos;ve really had enough of people attacking .
I mean , we &apos;ve been lucky &#91; most of &#93; the time .
But now I &apos;m feeling really weird because I &apos;m living what Sun Tzu said one week .
One week he said , &quot; Those who go into battle and win will want to go back , and those who lose in battle will want to go back and win . &quot;
And so I &apos;ve been winning battles , so I &apos;m going into battles , more battles .
And I think it &apos;s sort of weird to be living what Sun Tzu said .
JH : I get chills every time I see that .
That &apos;s the kind of engagement you want to have happen .
And I can &apos;t design that , I can &apos;t plan that , and I can &apos;t even test that .
But it &apos;s self-evident assessment .
We know that &apos;s an authentic assessment of learning .
We have a lot of data , but I think sometimes we go beyond data with the real truth of what &apos;s going on .
So I &apos;ll just share a third story .
This is about my friend Brennan .
We had played the game one session after school for many weeks , about seven weeks , and we had essentially solved all 50 of the interlocking crises .
The way the game is won is all 50 problems have to be solved and every country &apos;s asset value has to be increased above its starting point .
Some are poor , some are wealthy . There are billions .
The World Bank president was a third-grader one time .
He says , &quot; How many zeros in a trillion ? I &apos;ve got to calculate that right away . &quot;
But he was setting fiscal policy in that game for high school players who were playing with him .
So the team that was the poorest had gotten even poorer .
There was no way they could win .
And we were approaching four o &apos;clock , our cut-off time -- there was about a minute left -- and despair just settled over the room .
I thought , I &apos;m failing as a teacher .
I should have gotten it so they could have won .
They shouldn &apos;t be failing like this .
I &apos;ve failed them .
And I was just feeling so sad and dejected .
And suddenly , Brennan walked over to my chair and he grabbed the bell , the bell I ring to signal a change or a reconvening of cabinets , and he ran back to his seat , rang the bell .
Everybody ran to his chair : there was screaming ; there was yelling , waving of their dossiers .
They get these dossiers full of secret documents .
They were gesticulating ; they were running around .
I didn &apos;t know what they were doing . I &apos;d lost control of my classroom .
Principal walks in , I &apos;m out of a job .
The parents were looking in the window .
And Brennan runs back to his seat . Everybody runs back to their seat .
He rings the bell again . He says , &quot; We have &quot; -- and there &apos;s 12 seconds left on the clock -- &quot; we have , all nations , pooled all our funds together .
And we &apos;ve got 600 billion dollars .
We &apos;re going to offer it as a donation to this poor country .
And if they accept it , it &apos;ll raise their asset value and we can win the game .
Will you accept it ? &quot;
And there are three seconds left on the clock .
Everybody looks at this prime minister of that country , and he says , &quot; Yes . &quot;
And the game is won .
Spontaneous compassion that could not be planned for , that was unexpected and unpredictable .
Every game we play is different .
Some games are more about social issues , some are more about economic issues .
Some games are more about warfare .
But I don &apos;t try to deny them that reality of being human .
I allow them to go there and , through their own experience , learn , in a bloodless way , how not to do what they consider to be the wrong thing .
And they find out what is right their own way , their own selves .
And so in this game , I &apos;ve learned so much from it , but I would say that if only they could pick up a critical thinking tool or creative thinking tool from this game and leverage something good for the world , they may save us all .
If only .
And on behalf of all of my teachers on whose shoulders I &apos;m standing , thank you . Thank you . Thank you .
Nic Marks : The Happy Planet Index
Statistician Nic Marks asks why we measure a nation &apos;s success by its productivity -- instead of by the happiness and well-being of its people . He introduces the Happy Planet Index , which tracks national well-being against resource use . Which countries rank highest in the HPI ? You might be surprised .
Martin Luther King did not say , &quot; I have a nightmare , &quot; when he inspired the civil rights movements .
He said , &quot; I have a dream . &quot;
And I have a dream .
I have a dream that we can stop thinking that the future will be a nightmare , and this is going to be a challenge , because , if you think of every major blockbusting film of recent times , nearly all of its visions for humanity are apocalyptic .
I think this film is one of the hardest watches of modern times , &quot; The Road . &quot;
It &apos;s a beautiful piece of filmmaking , but everything is desolate , everything is dead .
And just a father and son trying to survive , walking along the road .
And I think the environmental movement of which I am a part of has been complicit in creating this vision of the future .
For too long , we have peddled a nightmarish vision of what &apos;s going to happen .
We have focused on the worst-case scenario .
We have focused on the problems .
And we have not thought enough about the solutions .
We &apos;ve used fear , if you like , to grab people &apos;s attention .
And any psychologist will tell you that fear in the organism is linked to flight mechanism .
It &apos;s part of the fight and flight mechanism , that when an animal is frightened -- think of a deer .
A deer freezes very , very still , poised to run away .
And I think that &apos;s what we &apos;re doing when we &apos;re asking people to engage with our agenda around environmental degradation and climate change .
People are freezing and running away because we &apos;re using fear .
And I think the environmental movement has to grow up and start to think about what progress is .
What would it be like to be improving the human lot ?
And one of the problems that we face , I think , is that the only people that have cornered the market in terms of progress is a financial definition of what progress is , an economic definition of what progress is -- that somehow , if we get the right numbers to go up , we &apos;re going to be better off , whether that &apos;s on the stock market , whether that &apos;s with GDP and economic growth , that somehow life is going to get better .
This is somehow appealing to human greed instead of fear -- that more is better .
Come on . In the Western world , we have enough .
Maybe some parts of the world don &apos;t , but we have enough .
And we &apos;ve know for a long time that this is not a good measure of the welfare of nations .
In fact , the architect of our national accounting system , Simon Kuznets , in the 1930s , said that , &quot; A nation &apos;s welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income . &quot;
But we &apos;ve created a national accounting system which is firmly based on production and producing stuff .
And indeed , this is probably historical , and it had its time .
In the second World War , we needed to produce a lot of stuff .
And indeed , we were so successful at producing certain types of stuff that we destroyed a lot of Europe , and we had to rebuild it afterwards .
And so our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce .
But as early as 1968 , this visionary man , Robert Kennedy , at the start of his ill-fated presidential campaign , gave the most eloquent deconstruction of gross national product that ever has been .
And he finished his talk with the phrase , that , &quot; The gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile . &quot;
How crazy is that ? That our measure of progress , our dominant measure of progress in society , is measuring everything except that which makes life worthwhile ?
I believe , if Kennedy was alive today , he would be asking statisticians such as myself to go out and find out what makes life worthwhile .
He &apos;d be asking us to redesign our national accounting system to be based upon such important things as social justice , sustainability and people &apos;s well-being .
And actually , social scientists have already gone out and asked these questions around the world .
This is from a global survey .
It &apos;s asking people , what do they want .
And unsurprisingly , people all around the world say that what they want is happiness , for themselves , for their families , their children , their communities .
Okay , they think money is slightly important .
It &apos;s there , but it &apos;s not nearly as important as happiness , and it &apos;s not nearly as important as love .
We all need to love and be loved in life .
It &apos;s not nearly as important as health .
We want to be healthy and live a full life .
These seem to be natural human aspirations .
Why are statisticians not measuring these ?
Why are we not thinking of the progress of nations in these terms , instead of just how much stuff we have ?
And really , this is what I &apos;ve done with my adult life -- is think about how do we measure happiness , how do we measure well-being , how can we do that within environmental limits .
And we created , at the organization that I work for , the New Economics Foundation , something we call the Happy Planet Index , because we think people should be happy and the planet should be happy .
Why don &apos;t we create a measure of progress that shows that ?
And what we do , is we say that the ultimate outcome of a nation is how successful is it at creating happy and healthy lives for its citizens .
That should be the goal of every nation on the planet .
But we have to remember that there &apos;s a fundamental input to that , and that is how many of the planet &apos;s resources we use .
We all have one planet . We all have to share it .
It is the ultimate scarce resource , the one planet that we share .
And economics is very interested in scarcity .
When it has a scarce resource that it wants to turn into a desirable outcome , it thinks in terms of efficiency .
It thinks in terms of how much bang do we get for our buck .
And this is a measure of how much well-being we get for our planetary resource use .
It is an efficiency measure .
And probably the easiest way to show you that , is to show you this graph .
Running horizontally along the graph , is &quot; ecological footprint , &quot; which is a measure of how much resources we use and how much pressure we put on the planet .
More is bad .
Running vertically upwards , is a measure called &quot; happy life years . &quot;
It &apos;s about the well-being of nations .
It &apos;s like a happiness adjusted life-expectancy .
It &apos;s like quality and quantity of life in nations .
And the yellow dot there you see , is the global average .
Now , there &apos;s a huge array of nations around that global average .
To the top right of the graph , are countries which are doing reasonably well and producing well-being , but they &apos;re using a lot of planet to get there .
They are the U.S.A. , other Western countries going across in those triangles and a few Gulf states in there actually .
Conversely , at the bottom left of the graph , are countries that are not producing much well-being -- typically , sub-Saharan Africa .
In Hobbesian terms , life is short and brutish there .
The average life expectancy in many of these countries is only 40 years .
Malaria , HIV / AIDS are killing a lot of people in these regions of the world .
But now for the good news !
There are some countries up there , yellow triangles , that are doing better than global average , that are heading up towards the top left of the graph .
This is an aspirational graph .
We want to be top left , where good lives don &apos;t cost the earth .
They &apos;re Latin American .
The country on its own up at the top is a place I haven &apos;t been to .
Maybe some of you have .
Costa Rica .
Costa Rica -- average life expectancy is 78-and-a-half years .
That is longer than in the USA .
They are , according to the latest Gallup world poll , the happiest nation on the planet -- than anybody ; more than Switzerland and Denmark .
They are the happiest place .
They are doing that on a quarter of the resources that are used typically in &#91; the &#93; Western world -- a quarter of the resources .
What &apos;s going on there ?
What &apos;s happening in Costa Rica ?
We can look at some of the data .
99 percent of their electricity comes from renewable resources .
Their government is one of the first to commit to be carbon neutral by 2021 .
They abolished the army in 1949 -- 1949 .
And they invested in social programs -- health and education .
They have one of the highest literacy rates in Latin America and in the world .
And they have that Latin vibe , don &apos;t they .
They have the social connectedness .
The challenge is , that possibly -- and the thing we might have to think about -- is that the future might not be North American , might not be Western European .
It might be Latin American .
And the challenge , really , is to pull the global average up here .
That &apos;s what we need to do .
And if we &apos;re going to do that , we need to pull countries from the bottom , and we need to pull countries from the right of the graph .
And then we &apos;re starting to create a happy planet .
That &apos;s one way of looking at it .
Another way of looking at it is looking at time trends .
We don &apos;t have good data going back for every country in the world , but for some of the richest countries , the OECD group , we do .
And this is the trend in well-being over that time , a small increase , but this is the trend in ecological footprint .
And so in strict happy-planet methodology , we &apos;ve become less efficient at turning our ultimate scarce resource into the outcome we want to .
And the point really is , is that I think , probably everybody in this room would like society to get to 2050 without an apocalyptic something happening .
It &apos;s actually not very long away .
It &apos;s half a human lifetime away .
A child entering school today will be my age in 2050 .
This is not the very distant future .
This is what the U.K. government target on carbon and greenhouse emissions looks like .
And I put it to you , that is not business as usual .
That is changing our business .
That is changing the way we create our organizations , we do our government policy and we live our lives .
And the point is , we need to carry on increasing well-being .
No one can go to the polls and say that quality of life is going to reduce .
None of us , I think , want human progress to stop .
I think we want it to carry on .
I think we want the lot of humanity to keep on increasing .
And I think this is where climate change skeptics and deniers come in .
I think this is what they want . They want quality of life to keep increasing .
They want to hold on to what they &apos;ve got .
And if we &apos;re going to engage them , I think that &apos;s what we &apos;ve got to do .
And that means we have to really increase efficiency even more .
Now that &apos;s all very easy to draw graphs and things like that , but the point is we need to turn those curves .
And this is where I think we can take a leaf out of systems theory , systems engineers , where they create feedback loops , put the right information at the right point of time .
Human beings are very motivated by the &quot; now . &quot;
You put a smart meter in your home , and you see how much electricity you &apos;re using right now , how much it &apos;s costing you , your kids go around and turn the lights off pretty quickly .
What would that look like for society ?
Why is it , on the radio news every evening , I hear the FTSE 100 , the Dow Jones , the dollar pound ratio -- I don &apos;t even know which way the dollar pound ratio should go to be good news .
And why do I hear that ?
Why don &apos;t I hear how much energy Britain used yesterday , or American used yesterday ?
Did we meet our three percent annual target on reducing carbon emissions ?
That &apos;s how you create a collective goal .
You put it out there into the media and start thinking about it .
And we need positive feedback loops for increasing well-being At a government level , they might create national accounts of well-being .
At a business level , you might look at the well-being of your employees , which we know is really linked to creativity , which is linked to innovation , and we &apos;re going to need a lot of innovation to deal with those environmental issues .
At a personal level , we need these nudges too .
Maybe we don &apos;t quite need the data , but we need reminders .
In the U.K. , we have a strong public health message on five fruit and vegetables a day and how much exercise we should do -- never my best thing .
What are these for happiness ?
What are the five things that you should do every day to be happier ?
We did a project for the Government Office of Science a couple of years ago , a big program called the Foresight program -- lots and lots of people -- involved lots of experts -- everything evidence based -- a huge tome .
But a piece of work we did was on : what five positive actions can you do to improve well-being in your life ?
And the point of these is they are , not quite , the secrets of happiness , but they are things that I think happiness will flow out the side from .
And the first of these is to connect , is that your social relationships are the most important cornerstones of your life .
Do you invest the time with your loved ones that you could do , and energy ?
Keep building them .
The second one is be active .
The fastest way out of a bad mood : step outside , go for a walk , turn the radio on and dance .
Being active is great for our positive mood .
The third one is take notice .
How aware are you of things going on around the world , the seasons changing , people around you ?
Do you notice what &apos;s bubbling up for you and trying to emerge ?
Based on a lot of evidence for mindfulness , cognitive behavioral therapy , &#91; very &#93; strong for our well being .
The fourth is keep learning and keep is important -- learning throughout the whole life course .
Older people who keep learning and are curious , they have much better health outcomes than those who start to close down .
But it doesn &apos;t have to be formal learning ; it &apos;s not knowledge based .
It &apos;s more curiosity .
It can be learning to cook a new dish , picking up an instrument you forgot as a child .
Keep learning .
And the final one is that most anti-economic of activities , but give .
Our generosity , our altruism , our compassion , are all hardwired to the reward mechanism in our brain .
We feel good if we give .
You can do an experiment where you give two groups of people a hundred dollars in the morning .
You tell one of them to spend it on themselves and one on other people .
You measure their happiness at the end of the day , those that have gone and spent on other people are much happier that those that spent it on themselves .
And these five ways , which we put onto these handy postcards , I would say , don &apos;t have to cost the earth .
They don &apos;t have any carbon content .
They don &apos;t need a lot of material goods to be satisfied .
And so I think it &apos;s really quite feasible that happiness does not cost the earth .
Now , Martin Luther King , on the eve of his death , gave an incredible speech .
He said , &quot; I know there are challenges ahead , there may be trouble ahead , but I fear no one . I don &apos;t care .
I have been to the mountain top , and I have seen the Promised Land . &quot;
Now , he was a preacher , but I believe the environmental movement and , in fact , the business community , government , needs to go to the top of the mountain top , and it needs to look out , and it needs to see the Promised Land , or the land of promise , and it needs to have a vision of a world that we all want .
And not only that , we need to create a Great Transition to get there , and we need to pave that great transition with good things .
Human beings want to be happy .
Pave them with the five ways .
And we need to have signposts gathering people together and pointing them -- something like the Happy Planet Index .
And then I believe that we can all create a world we all want , where happiness does not cost the earth .
Shirin Neshat : Art in exile
Iranian-born artist Shirin Neshat explores the paradox of being an artist in exile : a voice for her people , but unable to go home . In her work , she explores Iran pre- and post-Islamic Revolution , tracing political and societal change through powerful images of women .
The story I wanted to share with you today is my challenge as an Iranian artist , as an Iranian woman artist , as an Iranian woman artist living in exile .
Well , it has its pluses and minuses .
On the dark side , politics doesn &apos;t seem to escape people like me .
Every Iranian artist , in one form or another , is political .
Politics have defined our lives .
If you &apos;re living in Iran , you &apos;re facing censorship , harassment , arrest , torture -- at times , execution .
If you &apos;re living outside like me , you &apos;re faced with life in exile -- the pain of the longing and the separation from your loved ones and your family .
Therefore , we don &apos;t find the moral , emotional , psychological and political space to distance ourselves from the reality of social responsibility .
Oddly enough , an artist such as myself finds herself also in the position of being the voice , the speaker of my people , even if I have , indeed , no access to my own country .
Also , people like myself , we &apos;re fighting two battles on different grounds .
We &apos;re being critical of the West , the perception of the West about our identity -- about the image that is constructed about us , about our women , about our politics , about our religion .
We are there to take pride and insist on respect .
And at the same time , we &apos;re fighting another battle .
That is our regime , our government -- our atrocious government , &#91; that &#93; has done every crime in order to stay in power .
Our artists are at risk .
We are in a position of danger .
We pose a threat to the order of the government .
But ironically , this situation has empowered all of us , because we are considered , as artists , central to the cultural , political , social discourse in Iran .
We are there to inspire , to provoke , to mobilize , to bring hope to our people .
We are the reporters of our people , and are communicators to the outside world .
Art is our weapon .
Culture is a form of resistance .
I envy sometimes the artists of the West for their freedom of expression .
For the fact that they can distance themselves from the question of politics .
From the fact that they are only serving one audience , mainly the Western culture .
But also , I worry about the West , because often in this country , in this Western world that we have , culture risks being a form of entertainment .
Our people depend on our artists , and culture is beyond communication .
My journey as an artist started from a very , very personal place .
I did not start to make social commentary about my country .
The first one that you see in front of you is actually when I first returned to Iran after being separated for a good 12 years .
It was after the Islamic Revolution of 1979 .
While I was absent from Iran , the Islamic Revolution had descended on Iran and had entirely transformed the country from Persian to the Islamic culture .
I came mainly to be reunited with my family and to reconnect in a way that I found my place in the society .
But instead , I found a country that was totally ideological and that I didn &apos;t recognize anymore .
More so , I became very interested , as I was facing my own personal dilemmas and questions , I became immersed in the study of the Islamic Revolution -- how , indeed , it had incredibly transformed the lives of Iranian women .
I found the subject of Iranian women immensely interesting , in the way the women of Iran , historically , seemed to embody the political transformation .
So in a way , by studying a woman , you can read the structure and the ideology of the country .
So I made a group of work that at once faced my own personal questions in life , and yet it brought my work into a larger discourse -- the subject of martyrdom , the question of those who willingly stand in that intersection of love of God , faith , but violence and crime and cruelty .
For me , this became incredibly important .
And yet , I had an unusual position toward this .
I was an outsider who had come back to Iran to find my place , but I was not in a position to be critical of the government or the ideology of the Islamic Revolution .
This changed slowly as I found my voice and I discovered things that I didn &apos;t know I would discover .
So my art became slightly more critical .
My knife became a little sharper .
And I fell into a life in exile .
I am a nomadic artist .
I work in Morocco , in Turkey , in Mexico .
I go everywhere to make
